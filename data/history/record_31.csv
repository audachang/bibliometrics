We learned, that on the average there are 2.47 authors per PNe paper, and that the PNe researchers are producing 1.74 papers per year - if they publish at least once per year on PNe. In addition, we do not hesitate to give a list of names (the Top Ten), as far as their total number of papers on PNe are concerned.

Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), one of the largest administrative health care databases around the world, has been used widely in academic studies. This study analyzed 383 NHIRD studies published between 2000 and 2009 to quantify the effects on overall growth, scholar response, and spread of the study fields. The NHIRD studies expanded rapidly in both quantity and quality since the first study was published in 2000. Researchers usually collaborated to share knowledge, which was crucial to process the NHIRD data. However, once the fundamental problem had been overcome, success to get published became more reproducible. NHIRD studies were also published diversely in a growing number of journals. Both general health and clinical science studies benefited from NIIIRD. In conclusion, this new research material widely promotes scientific production in a greater magnitude. The experience of Taiwan's NHIRD should encourage national- or institutional-level data holders to consider re-using their administrative databases for academic purposes.","Chen, YC (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Dept Med Informat, Neuenheimer Feld 305, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.","20","105","106","13","48","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","2","2011","86","2","365","380","16","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","710FL","WOS:000286496200011","","","","Univ Heidelberg, Dept Med Informat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.|Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Family Med, Taipei, Taiwan.|Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Neurol Inst, Dept Neurosurg, Taipei, Taiwan.|Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Pharmacol, Taipei 112, Taiwan.|Natl Yang Ming Univ, Sch Med, Taipei 112, Taiwan.|Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Hosp & Hlth Care Adm, Taipei 112, Taiwan.","Chen, Yu-Chun/B-1227-2012","Chen, Yu-Chun/0000-0002-4124-1949","administrative health care database|national health insurance research database|bibliometric analysis|knowledge growth","Yu-Chun.Chen@stud.uni-heidelberg.de","","","","","","","","","6","2","0","4"

Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals? In addition to the 2-year IF (IF2), we consider the 5-year IF (IF5), the respective numerators of these IFs, and the number of Total Cites, counted both as integers and fractionally. These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/NSF (National Science Foundation) provides statistically significant between-field effects. Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7% in the case of IF5, and by 79.2% in the case of IF2. However, the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting. These results accord with previous studies, but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields.","Leydesdorff, L (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Kloveniersburgwal 48, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.","60","10","10","2","38","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

However, less attention has been paid to propose a delineating method to retrieve relevant research areas on specific subjects. This study aims at proposing a procedure to delineate research areas addressed in case nanocellulose. We investigate how a bibliometric analysis could provide interesting insights into research about this sustainable nanomaterial. The research topics clustered by a Publication-level Classification System were used. The procedure involves an iterative process, which includes developing and cleaning a set of core publication regarding the subject and an analysis of clusters they are associated with. Nanocellulose was selected as the subject of study, but the methodology may be applied to any other research area or topic. A discussion about each step of the procedure is provided. The proposed delineation procedure enables us to retrieve relevant publications from research areas involving nanocellulose. Seventeen research topics were mapped and associated with current research challenges on nanocellulose.","Milanez, DH (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Informat Technol Mat NIT Mat, Dept Mat Engn, Km 235, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.; Noyons, E (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies CWTS, POB 905, NL-2300 AX Leiden, Netherlands.; Milanez, DH (reprint author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Res Technol & Org Intelligence PERITO, Dept Informat Sci, Km 235, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.","50","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","5","2016","107","2","627","643","17","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","DM3VA","WOS:000376273600017","15th International Conference of the International-Society-for-Scientometrics-and-Informetrics (ISSI)","JUN 29-JUL 04, 2015","Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, TURKEY","Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Informat Technol Mat NIT Mat, Dept Mat Engn, Km 235, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.|Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies CWTS, POB 905, NL-2300 AX Leiden, Netherlands.|Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Res Technol & Org Intelligence PERITO, Dept Informat Sci, Km 235, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.","","","bibliometrics|research topics|science classification|nanotechnology","douglasmilanez@yahoo.com.br|noyons@cwts.leidenuniv.nl","Sao Paulo Research Foundation [2012/16573-7]|Graduate Program in Materials Science and Engineering at the Federal University of Sao Carlos","The authors are grateful to the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Process Number 2012/16573-7) and comments from researchers of CWTS, NIT/Materiais, and ISSI Conference.

However, it has been recognized that citation distributions vary among fields of science and that one needs to normalize for this. Furthermore, the mean-or any central-tendency statistics-is not a good representation of the citation distribution because these distributions are skewed. Important steps have been taken to solve these two problems during the last few years. First, one can normalize at the article level using the citing audience as the reference set. Second, one can use non-parametric statistics for testing the significance of differences among ratings. A proportion of most-highly cited papers (the top-10% or top-quartile) on the basis of fractional counting of the citations may provide an alternative to the current IF. This indicator is intuitively simple, allows for statistical testing, and accords with the state of the art.","Leydesdorff, L (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Kloveniersbugwal 48, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.","54","24","24","6","44","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","8","2012","92","2","355","365","11","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","975YF","WOS:000306547000013","","","","Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.","Leydesdorff, Loet/E-2903-2010","Leydesdorff, Loet/0000-0002-7835-3098","nonparametric|source normalization|citation|journal|impact","loet@leydesdorff.net","","","","","","SI","","","1","0","0","1"

Information visualization plays an integral role in modeling and representing intellectual structures associated with scientific disciplines. In this article, the domain of computer graphics is visualized based on author cocitation patterns derived from an 18-year span of the prestigious IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (1982-1999), This domain visualization utilizes a series of visualization and animation techniques, including author cocitation maps, citation time lines, animation of a high-dimensional specialty space, and institutional profiles. This approach not only augments traditional domain analysis and the understanding of scientific disciplines, but also produces a persistent and shared knowledge space for researchers to keep track the development of knowledge more effectively. The results of the domain visualization are discussed and triangulated in a broader context of the computer graphics field.","Chen, CM (reprint author), Brunel Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Comp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.","22","35","35","1","13","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","NEW YORK","605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

Using the ""Technological Activity and Impact Indicators Database"" of CHI Research/Computer Horizons, Inc., we identified the South African Innovation profile for the period 1975-1988.  Patents are analysed in their aggregate form in patent classes, Standard Industrial Classes and technologically similar classes.  The result indicates a shift of activity from low medium technology fields and a weakness in high technology fields.  Comparison of scientific and technological activity also reveals that South Africa contributes five times as much in international science than it does in technology.  Detailed analyses indicate the rise of a defence related industry in the country and reveal areas of emphasis and neglect.","POURIS, A (reprint author), FDN RES DEV,CTR SCIENTOMETR ADVISORY,PRETORIA 0001,SOUTH AFRICA.","12","4","4","0","1","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","5","1991","21","1","23","35","13","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","FM495","WOS:A1991FM49500002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","0","1"

Answers, it has become important to understand the key drivers of user decision-making processes. In the online environment, building and maintaining user trust belief is a significant challenge to the continuing growth and long-term viability of information systems (IS), due to the open nature of the Internet. This study develops a theoretical framework to examine the role of trust belief in the CKS post-adoption phenomenon. This study also presents an investigation of the key antecedents of trust belief to understand the mechanism of building user trust belief in a CKS. Based on the multidimensional trust formation model, this study posits user satisfaction, perceived reputation, disposition to trust, and information quality as the trust belief antecedents. Data collected from 258 users who have direct experiences with Naver Knowledge In was used to test the research model using structural equation modeling. This study preliminarily confirms the salience of user trust belief in the CKS post-adoption phenomenon. The findings also indicate that the cognitive-based, affective-based, and personality-oriented trust antecedents play a significant role in enhancing trust belief in a CKS. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are described.","Kim, B (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business, 207-43 Cheongrangri Dong, Seoul 130722, South Korea.","43","39","39","2","20","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

This work proposes appropriate scaling of the h-index based on its probability distribution that is calculated for any underlying citation distribution. The proposed approach outperforms existing index estimation models that have focused on the expected value only (i.e., first moment). Furthermore, it is shown that average number of citations per publication per scientific field, total number of publications per researcher, as well as researcher's h-index measured value, expected value, and standard deviation constitute the minimum information required for meaningful h-index ranking campaigns; otherwise contradicting ranking results emerge. This work may potentially shed light to (current or future) large-scale, h-index-based bibliometric evaluations.","Bletsas, A (reprint author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Phys, RCL, Thessaloniki 54453, Greece.","28","5","5","0","4","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

The study takes into account two mechanisms of opinion formation for individual scientists: influence of coworkers with whom there is direct interaction and cumulative influence of the subject literature. We analyze the evolution of relative popularity of different competing theories, depending on their accuracy in describing observed phenomena and on current social support of the theory. We include such aspects as finite lifetime of publication impact and tendency to 'defend' one's own opinions, especially if they were already published. A special class of publications, delivering crucial observational or experimental data, which may revolutionize the scientific worldview is considered.

First we present a conceptual framework for analyzing image topicality, explicating the layers, the perspectives, and the topical relevance relationships involved in modeling the topicality of art images. We adapt a generic relevance typology to image analysis by extending it with definitions and relationships specific to the visual art domain and integrating it with schemes of image-text relationships that are important for image subject indexing. We then apply the adapted typology to analyze the topical relevance relationships between 11 art images and 768 image tags assigned by art historians and librarians. The original contribution of our work is the topical structure analysis of image tags that allows the viewer to more easily grasp the content, context, and meaning of an image and quickly tune into aspects of interest; it could also guide both the indexer and the searcher to specify image tags/descriptors in a more systematic and precise manner and thus improve the match between the two parties. An additional contribution is systematically examining and integrating the variety of image-text relationships from a relevance perspective. The paper concludes with implications for relational indexing and social tagging.","Huang, XL (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, 135 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","75","0","0","7","15","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2330-1635","J ASSOC INF SCI TECH","","8","2015","66","8","1616","1644","29","Computer Science, Information Systems|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","CM6RO","WOS:000357817600007","","","","Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.|SUNY Buffalo, Grad Sch Educ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.|Univ Maryland, Inst Adv Comp Studies, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","","","(attributes)|(attributes of information and data)|relevance|(activities and operations)|information operations|organization of information|indexing","hxiaoli3@sysu.edu.cn|dsoergel@buffalo.edu|jklavans@umd.edu","Mellon Foundation [CLiMB-2]|National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71102100]|Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [13wkpy12]|IMLS research grant [LG3008011708]","This work was supported in part by the Mellon Foundation research grant CLiMB-2, by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) research grant 71102100, by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China research grant 13wkpy12, and by the IMLS research grant LG3008011708.","","","2330-1643","","","","3","0","1","2"

Among the Brazilian research institutions, the publications of the University of Sao Paulo (USP) have been around 30% of the country's total publication within the ISI database. A similar share was found for USP's publications published in the 1980-1999 period and classified in the Life Sciences. This was observed in publications from both the highest impact factor journals and from those with the largest number of articles. We have found that the present share of USP's publications in some of the fields of the Life Sciences was much less than 30%, suggesting a gradual decentralization of the scientific activity in Brazil. The data point out that this set of USP's publications were concentrated in traditional and basic fields of biological research, where the focus is mainly oriented by international trends. The data suggest that USP's researchers have not been much devoted to some of the fields where research is oriented toward national issues.","Leta, J (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Educ Gestao & Difusao Biociencias, Inst Bioquim Med, Bloco B,Sala 39,Predio CCS,Cidade Univ, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.","13","6","6","0","3","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","6","2005","63","3","599","616","18","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","924UH","WOS:000229005500009","","","","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Educ Gestao & Difusao Biociencias, Inst Bioquim Med, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.|Inst Dante Pazzanese Cardiol, Lab Epidemiol & Estat, Sao Paulo, Brazil.|Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, BR-01498 Sao Paulo, Brazil.","Pereira, Julio/B-1886-2008|Chaimovich, Hernan/B-8393-2009|Chaimovich, Hernan/B-5006-2011","Pereira, Julio/0000-0002-4920-320X|Chaimovich, Hernan/0000-0001-9380-2157","","jleta@bioqmed.ufrj.br","","","","","","","","","3","0","0","3"

It may be necessitated by interdisciplinary research, the evolution of a discipline, or the intention of quality improvement. This article studies the relationship between the authorship and the quality of articles (publications in better impact factor journals or core journals) in the field of Oceanography. The result shows similar to 75 % increase in the number of authors per article from 1990 to 2009 in the discipline. The increase in authorship correlates not only with the percentage of articles in core journals but also with the mean impact factor (IF) of journals (where the articles were published). The ANOVA study shows that though multi-authorship has no influence on the preference to publish in core journals during the 1990s or 2000s, it does have a significant influence on the preference to publish in high IF journals in both the decades. So these findings establish that in the field of Oceanography, the increase in collaboration would have resulted in more publications in core journals (without any influence of authorship increase) and in better impact factor journals (due to the influence of authorship increase).","Sahu, SR (reprint author), CSIR, Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India.","23","2","2","3","24","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","3","2014","98","3","2161","2168","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","AB1NT","WOS:000331559800036","","","","CSIR, Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India.|Sambalpur Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Sambalpur 768019, Odisha, India.","","","authorship|multiple authorship|co-authorship|impact factor|core journals|journal citation report|publish or perish|oceanography","satya@nio.org","","","","","1588-2861","","","","2","0","0","2"

Collections of diverse types of documents expose shortcomings in current approaches to ranking. Use of short fragments of documents, called passages, instead of whole documents can overcome these shortcomings: passage ranking provides convenient units of text to return to the user, can avoid the difficulties of comparing documents of different length, and enables identification of short blocks of relevant material among otherwise irrelevant text. In this article, we compare several kinds of passage in an extensive series of experiments. We introduce a new type of passage, overlapping fragments of either fixed or variable length, We show that ranking with these arbitrary passages gives substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness over traditional document ranking schemes, particularly for queries on collections of long documents. Ranking with arbitrary passages shows consistent improvements compared to ranking with whole documents, and to ranking with previous passage types that depend on document structure or topic shifts in documents.","Kaszkiel, M (reprint author), RMIT Univ, Dept Comp Sci, GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.","52","42","43","1","3","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","NEW YORK","605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

The paper updates the 1983 analysis of Shaw and Davis. The difference in the interpretations of information given respectively by Shannon and by Wiener, significant for the information sciences, receives particular consideration. Analysis of a range of material, from literary theory to thermodynamics, is used to draw out the issues. Emphasis is placed on recourse to the original sources, and on direct quotation, to attempt to overcome some of the misunderstandings and oversimplifications that have occurred with these topics. Although it is strongly related to entropy, information is neither identical with it, nor its opposite. Information is related to order and pattern, but also to disorder and randomness. The relations between information and the interesting complexity, which embodies both patterns and randomness, are worthy of attention.","Bawden, D (reprint author), City Univ London, Ctr Informat Sci, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.","167","0","0","4","12","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2330-1635","J ASSOC INF SCI TECH","","10","2015","66","10","1965","1987","23","Computer Science, Information Systems|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","CR2TW","WOS:000361184500001","","","","City Univ London, Ctr Informat Sci, London EC1V 0HB, England.","","","information theory|information entropy|complexity|randomness|physics","db@soi.city.ac.uk|lyn@soi.city.ac.uk","","","","","2330-1643","","","","2","1","0","1"

Previous work has reported descriptive statistics about these scientists' information-seeking behavior. This study extends that work to examine relationships between scientists' information-seeking behaviors and their personal and environmental factors. Several regression models, including the Poisson model, the logit model, and the ordered logit model, are built to interpret the correlation among scientists' behaviors. In addition, exploratory factor analysis is used for data reduction. Overall, many factors were found to affect the specific information-seeking behaviors of scientists, including demographic, psychological, role-related, and environmental factors. Of the factors having an effect, academic position was the most important determinant of information behavior.","Niu, X (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Informat & Lib Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","46","8","8","13","67","WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

In combination with peer judgements and other qualitative background knowledge, these analyses can serve as a basis for discussions about research performance quality. However, many mathematicians are not convinced that citation counts do in fact provide useful information in the field of mathematics. According to these mathematicians, citation and publication habits differ completely from scholarly fields such as chemistry or physics. Therefore, it is impossible to derive valid information regarding research performance from citation counts. The aim of this study is to obtain more insight into the significance of citation-based indicators in the field of mathematics. To which extent do citation-scores mirror to the opinions of experts concerning the quality of a paper or a journal? A survey was conducted to answer this question. Top journals, as qualified by experts, receive significantly higher citation rates than good journals. These good journals, in rum, have significantly higher scores than journals with the qualification less good. Top publications, recorded in the ISI database. receive on the average 15 times more citations than the mean score within the field of mathematics as a whole. In conclusion, the experts' views on top publications or top journals correspond very well to bibliometric indicators based on citation counts.","Korevaar, JC (reprint author), LEIDEN UNIV,CTR SCI & TECHNOL STUSIES,POB 9555,NL-2300 RB LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.","7","27","27","2","15","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0138-9130","SCIENTOMETRICS","SCIENTOMETRICS","9","1996","37","1","117","130","14","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Information Science & Library Science","Computer Science|Information Science & Library Science","VL476","WOS:A1996VL47600007","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","1","0","1"

In this paper, a simple operational definition of relevance is proposed for a Web-based library catalog: whether or not during a search session the user saves, prints, mails, or downloads a citation. If one of those actions is performed, the session is considered relevant to the user. An analysis is presented illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of this definition. With this definition and good transaction logging, it is possible to ascertain the relevance of a session. This was done for 905,970 sessions conducted with the University of California's Melvyl online catalog. Next, a methodology was developed to try to predict the relevance of a session. A number of variables were defined that characterize a session, none of which used any demographic information about the user. The values of the variables were computed for the sessions. Principal components analysis was used to extract a new set of variables out of the original set. A stratified random sampling technique was used to form ten strata such that each new strata of 90,570 sessions contained the same proportion of relevant to nonrelevant sessions. Logistic regression was used to ascertain the regression coefficients for nine of the ten strata. Then, the coefficients; were used to predict the relevance of the sessions in the missing strata. Overall, 17.85% of the sessions were determined to be relevant. The predicted number of relevant sessions for all ten strata was 11 %, a 6.85% difference. The authors believe that the methodology can be further refined and the prediction improved. This methodology could also have significant application in improving user searching and also in predicting electronic commerce buying decisions without the use of personal demographic data.","Cooper, MD (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat Management & Syst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","24","11","11","0","2","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","NEW YORK","605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.

Using nouns and verbs to identify the similar MUs, focusing and browsing models are applied to represent the summarization results. To reduce information loss during summarization, informative words in a document are introduced. For the evaluation, a question answering system (QA system) is proposed to substitute the human assessors. In large-scale experiments containing 140 questions to 17,877 documents, the results show that those models using informative words outperform pure heuristic voting-only strategy by news reporters. This model can be easily further applied to summarize multilingual news from multiple sources.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.","36","13","13","0","1","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-2882","J AM SOC INF SCI TEC","J.
