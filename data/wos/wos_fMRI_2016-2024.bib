Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Determining language laterality in patients with intractable
   epilepsy is important in operative planning. Wada testing is the gold
   standard, but it has a risk of stroke. Both Wada and task-based
   functional MRI (tb-fMRI) require patient cooperation. Recently,
   resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been explored for language
   lateralization. In the present study, the correlation between rs-fMRI
   and tb-fMRI in language lateralization is estimated in a pediatric
   population with intractable epilepsy.
   METHODS rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI language lateralization testing performed as
   part of epilepsy surgery evaluation was retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS Twenty-nine patients underwent rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI; a total of
   38 rs-fMRI studies and 30 tb-fMRI studies were obtained. tb-fMRI
   suggested left dominance in 25 of 30 cases (83\%), right in 3 (10\%),
   and in 2 (7\%) the studies were nondiagnostic. In rs-fMRI, 26 of 38
   studies (68\%) suggested left dominance, 3 (8\%) right dominance, 6
   (16\%) bilateral, and 3 (8\%) were nondiagnostic. When tb-fMRI
   lateralized to the left hemisphere (25 cases), rs-fMRI was lateralized
   to the left in 23 patients (92\%) and it was bilateral/equal in 2 (8\%).
   When tb-fMRI lateralized to the right (3 cases), rs-fMRI lateralized to
   the right in all cases (100\%). The overall concordance rate was 0.93
   (95\% CI 0.76-0.99) when considering cases with tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI
   performed within 6 months of each other, and tb-fMRI results were not
   nondiagnostic.
   CONCLUSIONS rs-fMRI significantly correlated with tb-fMRI in
   lateralizing language and suggests the potential role for identifying
   hemispheric dominance via rs-fMRI. Further investigation and validation
   studies are warranted.},

Abstract = {Multimodal functional neuroimaging by integrating functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) has the
   promise of recovering brain activities with high spatiotemporal
   resolution, which is crucial for neuroscience research and clinical
   diagnosis. However, the misalignment of the localizations between fMRI
   and EEG activities may degrade the accuracy of the fMRI-constrained EEG
   source imaging (ESI) technique. To leverage the complementary
   spatiotemporal resolution of fMRI and EEG in a data-driven fashion, we
   propose an asymmetric approach for EEG/fMRI fusion, termed fMRI-informed
   source imaging based on spatiotemporal basis functions (fMRI-SI-STBF).
   fMRI-SI-STBF employs the covariance components (CCs) derived from
   clusters defined by fMRI and EEG signals as spatial priors within the
   empirical Bayesian framework. Additionally, fMRI-SI-STBF represents the
   current source matrix as a linear combination of several unknown
   temporal basis functions (TBFs) by matrix decomposition. The relative
   contribution of each of the fMRI-informed and EEG-informed CCs, as well
   as the number and profiles of the TBFs, are all automatically determined
   based on the EEG data using variational Bayesian inference. Our results
   demonstrate that fMRI-SI-STBF can effectively utilize valid fMRI
   information for ESI and is robust to invalid fMRI priors. This
   robustness is essential for practical ESI since the validity of fMRI
   priors is often unclear considering that fMRI is an indirect measure of
   neural activity. Moreover, fMRI-SI-STBF can achieve performance
   improvement by incorporating temporal constraints compared to methods
   that use spatial constraints only. For the numerical simulations,
   fMRI-SISTBF reconstructs the source extents, locations and time courses
   more accurately than existing EEG-fMRI ESI methods (i.e., fwMNE,
   fMRI-SI-SBF) and ESI methods without fMRI priors (i.e., wMNE, LORETA,
   SBL, SISTBF, SI-SBF), indicated by the smaller spatial dispersion
   (average SD < 5 mm), distance of localization error (average DLE < 2
   mm), shape error (average SE < 0:9) and larger model evidence values.

Title = {Mapping language function with task-based vs. resting-state functional
   MRI},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Background
   Use of functional MRI (fMRI) in pre-surgical planning is a non-invasive
   method for pre-operative functional mapping for patients with brain
   tumors, especially tumors located near eloquent cortex. Currently, this
   practice predominantly involves task-based fMRI (T-fMRI). Resting state
   fMRI (RS-fMRI) offers an alternative with several methodological
   advantages. Here, we compare group-level analyses of RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI
   as methods for language localization.
   Purpose
   To contrast RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as techniques for localization of
   language function.
   Methods
   We analyzed data obtained in 35 patients who had both T-fMRI and RS-fMRI
   scans during the course of pre-surgical evaluation. The RS-fMRI data
   were analyzed using a previously trained resting-state network
   classifier. The T-fMRI data were analyzed using conventional techniques.
   Group-level results obtained by both methods were evaluated in terms of
   two outcome measures: (1) inter-subject variability of response
   magnitude and (2) sensitivity/specificity analysis of response
   topography, taking as ground truth previously reported maps of the
   language system based on intraoperative cortical mapping as well as
   meta-analytic maps of language task fMRI responses.
   Results
   Both fMRI methods localized major components of the language system
   (areas of Broca and Wernicke) although not with equal inter-subject
   consistency. Word-stem completion T-fMRI strongly activated Broca's area
   but also several task-general areas not specific to language. RS-fMRI
   provided a more specific representation of the language system.
   Conclusion
   We demonstrate several advantages of classifier-based mapping of
   language representation in the brain. Language T-fMRI activated
   task-general (i.e., not language-specific) functional systems in
   addition to areas of Broca and Wernicke. In contrast, classifier-based
   analysis of RS-fMRI data generated maps confined to language-specific
   regions of the brain.},

Abstract = {Background Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) is a well-established
   technique used to identify eloquent cortex, but has limitations,
   particularly in cognitively impaired patients who cannot perform
   language paradigms. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a
   potential alternative modality for presurgical mapping of language
   networks that does not require task performance. The purpose of our
   study is to determine the utility of rs-fMRI for clinical preoperative
   language mapping when tb-fMRI is limited. Methods We retrospectively
   reviewed 134 brain tumor patients who underwent preoperative fMRI
   language mapping. rs-fMRI was post-processed with seed-based correlation
   (SBC) analysis, when language tb-fMRI was limited. Two neuroradiologists
   reviewed both the tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI results. Six neurosurgeons
   retrospectively rated the usefulness of rs-fMRI for language mapping in
   their patients. Results Of the 134 patients, 49 cases had limited
   tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI was post-processed. Two neuroradiologists found
   rs-fMRI beneficial for functional language mapping in 41(84\%) and 43
   (88\%) cases respectively; Cohen's kappa is 0.83, with a 95\% confidence
   interval (0.61, 1.00). The neurosurgeons found rs-fMRI ``definitely{''}
   useful in 26 cases (60\%) and ``somewhat{''} useful in 13 cases (30\%)
   in locating potential eloquent language centers of clinical interest.
   Six unsuccessful rs-fMRI cases were due to: head motion (2 cases),
   nonspecific functionality connectivity outside the posterior language
   network (1 case), and an unknown system instability (3 cases).
   Conclusions This study is a proof of concept that shows SBC rs-fMRI may
   be a viable alternative for clinical language mapping when tb-fMRI is
   limited.},

   very promising for the design of brain rehabilitation protocols.
   However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The
   original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal
   NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG
   signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We
   propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict
   NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different
   NF-predictors stemming from the proposed model. We showed that
   predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG
   scores and significantly improves the correlation with bi-modal NF
   sessions compared to classical NF-EEG scores.},

Title = {Neurofunctional and behavioural measures associated with fMRI-
   neurofeedback learning in adolescents with
   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) targeting
   brain areas/networks shown to be dysfunctional by previous fMRI research
   is a promising novel neurotherapy for ADHD. Our pioneering study in 31
   adolescents with ADHD showed that fMRI-NF of the right inferior frontal
   cortex (rIFC) and of the left parahippocampal gyrus (1PHG) was
   associated with clinical improvements. Previous studies using
   electro-encephalography-NF have shown, however, that not all ADHD
   patients learn to self-regulate, and the predictors of fMRI-NF
   self-regulation learning are not presently known. The aim of the current
   study was therefore to elucidate the potential predictors of fMRI-NF
   learning by investigating the relationship between fMRI-NF learning and
   baseline inhibitory brain function during an fMRI stop task, along with
   clinical and cognitive measures. fMRI-NF learning capacity was
   calculated for each participant by correlating the number of completed
   fMRI-NF runs with brain activation in their respective target regions
   from each run (rIFC or lPHG); higher correlation values were taken as a
   marker of better (linear) fMRI-NF learning. Linear correlations were
   then conducted between baseline measures and the participants' capacity
   for fMRI-NF learning. Better fMRI-NF learning was related to increased
   activation in left inferior fronto-striatal regions during the fMRI stop
   task. Poorer self-regulation during fMRI-NF training was associated with
   enhanced activation in posterior temporo-occipital and cerebellar
   regions. Cognitive and clinical measures were not associated with
   general fMRI-NF learning across all participants. A categorical analysis
   showed that 48\% of adolescents with ADHD successfully learned fMRI-NF
   and this was also not associated with any baseline clinical or cognitive
   measures except that faster processing speed during inhibition and
   attention tasks predicted learning. Taken together, the findings suggest
   that imaging data are more predictive of fMRI-NF self-regulation skills
   in ADHD than behavioural data. Stronger baseline activation in
   fronto-striatal cognitive control regions predicts better fMRI-NF
   learning in ADHD.},

Pages = {443-448},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Recently introduced 3D radial MRI pulse sequence entitled Multi-Band
   SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation (MB-SWIFT) having virtually
   zero acquisition delay was used to obtain functional MRI (fMRI) contrast
   in rat's brain at 9.4 T during deep brain stimulation (DBS). The results
   demonstrate that MB-SWIFT allows functional images free of
   susceptibility artifacts, and provides an excellent fMRI activation
   contrast in the brain. Flip angle dependence of the MB-SWIFT fMRI signal
   and elimination of the fMRI contrast while using saturation bands,
   indicate a blood flow origin of the observed fMRI contrast. MB-SWIFT
   fMRI modality permits activation studies in the close proximity to an
   implanted lead, which is not possible to achieve with conventionally
   used gradient echo and spin echo - echo planar imaging fMRI techniques.
   We conclude that MB-SWIFT fMRI is a powerful imaging modality for
   investigations of functional responses during DBS.},

Title = {The utilisation of resting-state fMRI as a pre-operative mapping tool in

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE},

Abstract = {Purpose Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is
   suggested to be a viable option for pre-operative mapping for patients
   with brain tumours. However, it remains an open issue whether the tool
   is useful in the clinical setting compared to task-based fMRI (T-fMRI)
   and intraoperative mapping. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to
   investigate the usefulness of this technique.
   Methods A systematic literature search of rs-fMRI methods applied as a
   pre-operative mapping tool was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and
   Cochrane Library electronic databases following PRISMA guidelines.
   Results Results demonstrated that 50\% (six out of twelve) of the
   studies comparing rs-fMRI and T-fMRI showed good concordance for both
   language and sensorimotor networks. In comparison to intraoperative
   mapping, 86\% (six out of seven) studies found a good agreement to
   rs-fMRI. Finally, 87\% (twenty out of twenty-three) studies agreed that
   rs-fMRI is a suitable and useful pre-operative mapping tool.
   Conclusions rs-fMRI is a promising technique for pre-operative mapping
   in assessing the functional brain areas. However, the agreement between
   rs-fMRI with other techniques, including T-fMRI and intraoperative maps,
   is not yet optimal. Studies to ascertain and improve the sophistication
   in pre-processing of rs-fMRI imaging data are needed.},

Abstract = {fMRI has considerable potential as a translational tool for
   understanding risk, prioritizing interventions, and improving the
   treatment of brain disorders. However, recent studies have found that
   many of the most widely used fMRI measures have low reliability,
   undermining this potential. Here, we argue that many fMRI measures are
   unreliable because they were designed to identify group effects, not to
   precisely quantify individual differences. We then highlight four
   emerging strategies {[}extended aggregation, reliability modeling,
   multiecho fMRI (ME-fMRI), and stimulus design] that build on established
   psychometric properties to generate more precise and reliable fMRI
   measures. By adopting such strategies to improve reliability, we are
   optimistic that fMRI can fulfill its potential as a clinical tool.},

Abstract = {High-resolution fMRI enables noninvasive mapping of the hemodynamic
   responses from individual penetrating vessels in animal brains. Here, a
   2D multi-echo single-vessel fMRI (MESV-fMRI) method has been developed
   to map the fMRI signal from arterioles and venules with a 100ms sampling
   rate at multiple echo times (TE, 3-30ms) and short acquisition windows
   (<1ms). The T-2{*}-weighted signal shows the increased extravascular
   effect on venule voxels as a function of TE. In contrast, the arteriole
   voxels show an increased fMRI signal with earlier onset than venules
   voxels at the short TE (3ms) with increased blood inflow and volume
   effects. MESV-fMRI enables vessel-specific T2{*} mapping and presents
   T2{*}-based fMRI time courses with higher contrast-to-noise ratios
   (CNRs) than the T2{*}-weighted fMRI signal at a given TE. The
   vessel-specific T2{*} mapping also allows semi-quantitative estimation
   of the oxygen saturation levels (Y) and their changes (Delta Y) at a
   given blood volume fraction upon neuronal activation. The MESV-fMRI
   method enables vessel-specific T2{*} measurements with high
   spatiotemporal resolution for better modeling of the fMRI signal based
   on the hemodynamic parameters.},

Abstract = {The widely-used BOLD fMRI signal depends on various anatomical,
   physiological, and imaging parameters. Thus, it is important to examine
   its biophysical and physiological source in order to optimize, model and
   accurately interpret fMRI. Animal models have been used to investigate
   these issues to take systematic measurements and combine with
   conventional invasive approaches. Here, we reviewed and discussed
   multiple issues, including the echo time-dependent intravascular
   contribution and extravascular contributions, gradient-echo vs.
   spin-echo fMRI, the physiological source of BOLD fMRI, arterial vs.
   venous cerebral blood volume change, cerebral oxygen consumption change,
   and arterial oxygen saturation change. We then discuss future directions
   of animal fMRI and translation to human fMRI. Systematic biophysical
   BOLD fMRI studies provide insight into the modeling and interpretation
   of BOLD fMRI in animals and humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {PurposeTo compare language networks derived from resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) with task-fMRI in patients with brain tumors and investigate
   variables that affect rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance.
   Materials and MethodsIndependent component analysis (ICA) of rs-fMRI was
   performed with 20, 30, 40, and 50 target components (ICA20 to ICA50) and
   language networks identified for patients presenting for presurgical
   fMRI mapping between 1/1/2009 and 7/1/2015. 49 patients were analyzed
   fulfilling criteria for presence of brain tumors, no prior brain
   surgery, and adequate task-fMRI performance. Rs-vs-task-fMRI concordance
   was measured using Dice coefficients across varying fMRI thresholds
   before and after noise removal. Multi-thresholded Dice coefficient
   volume under the surface (DiceVUS) and maximum Dice coefficient
   (MaxDice) were calculated. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was
   performed to determine significance of DiceVUS and MaxDice between the
   four ICA order groups. Age, Sex, Handedness, Tumor Side, Tumor Size, WHO
   Grade, number of scrubbed volumes, image intensity root mean square
   (iRMS), and mean framewise displacement (FD) were used as predictors for
   VUS in a linear regression.
   ResultsArtificial elevation of rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance is seen
   at low thresholds due to noise. Noise-removed group-mean DiceVUS and
   MaxDice improved as ICA order increased, however ANOVA demonstrated no
   statistically significant difference between the four groups. Linear
   regression demonstrated an association between iRMS and DiceVUS for
   ICA30-50, and iRMS and MaxDice for ICA50.
   ConclusionOverall there is moderate group level rs-vs-task fMRI language
   network concordance, however substantial subject-level variability
   exists; iRMS may be used to determine reliability of rs-fMRI derived
   language networks. Hum Brain Mapp 37:913-923, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley

Title = {Minimizing susceptibility-induced BOLD sensitivity loss in multi-band

Abstract = {Objective. Interleaved reverse-gradient fMRI (RG-fMRI) with a
   point-spread-function (PSF) mapping-based distortion correction scheme
   has the potential to minimize signal loss in echo-planar-imaging (EPI).
   In this work, the RG-fMRI is further improved by imaging protocol
   optimization and application of reverse Fourier acquisition. Approach.
   Multi-band imaging was adapted for RG-fMRI to improve the temporal and
   spatial resolution. To better understand signal dropouts in forward and
   reverse EPIs, a simple theoretical relationship between echo shift and
   geometric distortion was derived and validated by the reliable
   measurements using PSF mapping method. After examining practical imaging
   protocols for RG-fMRI in three subjects on both a conventional
   whole-body and a high-performance compact 3 T, the results were compared
   and the feasibility to further improve the RG-fMRI scheme were explored.
   High-resolution breath-holding RG-fMRI was conducted with nine subjects
   on the compact 3 T and the fMRI reliability improvement in high
   susceptibility brain regions was demonstrated. Finally, reverse Fourier
   acquisition was applied to RG-fMRI, and its benefit was assessed by a
   simulation study based on the breath-holding RG-fMRI data. Main results.
   The temporal and spatial resolution of the multi-band RG-fMRI became
   feasible for whole-brain fMRI. Echo shift measurements from PSF mapping
   well estimated signal dropout effects in the EPI pair and were useful to
   further improve the RG-fMRI scheme. Breath-holding RG-fMRI demonstrated
   improved fMRI reliability in high susceptibility brain regions. Reverse
   partial Fourier acquisition omitting the late echoes could further
   improve the temporal or spatial resolution for RG-fMRI without
   noticeable signal degradation and spatial resolution loss. Significance.
   With the improved imaging scheme, RG-fMRI could reliably investigate the
   functional mechanisms of the human brain in the temporal and frontal
   areas suffering from susceptibility-induced functional sensitivity loss.},

Abstract = {The complexity of raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   with artifacts leads to significant challenges in multioperations with
   these data. FMRI data analysis is extensively used in neuroimaging
   fields, but the tools for processing fMRI data are lacking. A novel APP
   DESIGNER conversion, preprocessing, and postprocessing of fMRI (CPREPP
   fMRI) tool is proposed and developed in this work. This toolbox is
   intended for pipeline fMRI data analysis, including full analysis of
   fMRI data, starting from DICOM conversion, then checking the quality of
   data at each step, and ending in postprocessing analysis. The CPREPP
   fMRI tool includes 12 conversions of scientific processes that reflect
   all conversion possibilities among them. In addition, specific
   preprocessing order steps are proposed on the basis of data acquisition
   mode (interleaved and sequential modes). A severe and crucial comparison
   between statistical parametric and nonparametric mapping approaches of
   second-level analysis is presented in the same tool. The CPREPP fMRI
   tool can provide reports to exclude subjects with the extreme movement
   of the head during the scan, and a range of fMRI images are generated to
   verify the normalization effect easily. Real fMRI data are used in this
   work to prepare fMRI data tests. The experiment stimuli are chewing and
   biting, and the data are acquired from the National Magnetic Resonance
   Research (UMRAM) Center in Ankara, Turkey. A free dataset is used to
   compare the methods for postprocessing fMRI tests.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary We discussed the reliability of fMRI for in vivo
   evaluation of eloquent cortex, which helps to reduce the risk of
   postsurgical morbidity. Task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) is commonly utilized
   for the noninvasive, accurate evaluation of eloquent cortex implicated
   in sensorimotor, language, and visual function. Resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) is being increasingly employed in addition to tb-fMRI and may
   be able to serve as an adjunct for tb-fMRI for presurgical mapping in
   the future. There is, however, a need to confirm the reliability of
   rs-fMRI data in various clinical contexts, and more validation and
   standardization is necessary prior to adopting this tool for daily
   clinical care. Although tb-fMRI has been proved to be a trustworthy
   method, the problem of neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) needs to be
   addressed to give the most accurate functional evaluation in clinical
   practice. Breath-hold cerebrovascular reactivity (BH-CVR) methods can be
   used to assess risk of NVU. We hope that future research will
   investigate and overcome the problem of NVU encountered in presurgical
   brain mapping with BOLD fMRI.Abstract Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) technique is
   useful for preoperative mapping of brain functional networks in tumor
   patients, providing reliable in vivo detection of eloquent cortex to
   help reduce the risk of postsurgical morbidity. BOLD task-based fMRI
   (tb-fMRI) is the most often used noninvasive method that can reliably
   map cortical networks, including those associated with sensorimotor,
   language, and visual functions. BOLD resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is
   emerging as a promising ancillary tool for visualization of diverse
   functional networks. Although fMRI is a powerful tool that can be used
   as an adjunct for brain tumor surgery planning, it has some constraints
   that should be taken into consideration for proper clinical
   interpretation. BOLD fMRI interpretation may be limited by neurovascular
   uncoupling (NVU) induced by brain tumors. Cerebrovascular reactivity
   (CVR) mapping obtained using breath-hold methods is an effective method
   for evaluating NVU potential.},

Abstract = {Advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data are revealing increasingly rich
   spatiotemporal structure across the human brain. Nonetheless,
   uncertainty surrounding the origins of fMRI hemodynamic signals, and in
   the link between large-scale fMRI patterns and ongoing functional
   states, presently limits the neurobiological conclusions one can draw
   from fMRI alone. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides complementary
   information about neural electrical activity and state change, and
   simultaneously acquiring EEG together with fMRI presents unique
   opportunities for studying large-scale brain activity and gaining more
   information from fMRI itself. Here, we discuss the recent progress in
   the use of concurrent EEG-fMRI to enrich the investigation of neural and
   physiological states and clarify the origins of fMRI hemodynamic
   signals. Throughout, we outline perspectives on future directions and
   open challenges.},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been
   extensively used to study brain aging, but the age effect on the
   frequency content of the rs-fMRI signal has scarcely been examined.
   Moreover, the neuronal implications of such age effects and age-sex
   interaction remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of
   age and sex on the rs-fMRI signal frequency using the Leipzig
   mind-brain-body data set. Over a frequency band of up to 0.3 Hz, we
   found that the rs-fMRI fluctuation frequency is higher in the older
   adults, although the fluctuation amplitude is lower. The rs-fMRI signal
   frequency is also higher in men than in women. Both age and sex effects
   on fMRI frequency vary with the frequency band examined but are not
   found in the frequency of physiological-noise components. This higher
   rs-fMRI frequency in older adults is not mediated by the
   electroencephalograph (EEG)-frequency increase but a likely link between
   fMRI signal frequency and EEG entropy, which vary with age and sex.
   Additionally, in different rs-fMRI frequency bands, the fMRI-EEG
   amplitude ratio is higher in young adults. This is the first study to
   investigate the neuronal contribution to age and sex effects in the
   frequency dimension of the rs-fMRI signal and may lead to the
   development of new, frequency-based rs-fMRI metrics. Our study
   demonstrates that Fourier analysis of the fMRI signal can reveal novel
   information about aging. Furthermore, fMRI and EEG signals reflect
   different aspects of age- and sex-related brain differences, but the
   signal frequency and complexity, instead of amplitude, may hold their
   link.},

Title = {Establishing language laterality: does resting-state functional MRI

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) is now considered the
   standard, noninvasive technique in establishing language laterality in
   children for surgical planning. The evaluation can be limited due to
   several factors such as age, language barriers, and developmental and
   cognitive delays. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) offers a
   potential path to establish language dominance without active task
   participation. The authors sought to compare the ability of rsfMRI for
   language lateralization in the pediatric population with conventional
   tb-fMRI used as the gold standard. METHODS The authors performed a
   retrospective evaluation of all pediatric patients at a dedicated
   quaternary pediatric hospital who underwent tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI from
   2019 to 2021 as part of the surgical workup for patients with seizures
   and brain tumors. Task-based fMRI language laterality was based on a
   patient's adequate performance on one or more of the following: sentence
   completion, verb generation, antonym generation, or passive listening
   tasks. Restingstate fMRI data were postprocessed using statistical
   parametric mapping, FMRIB Software Library, and FreeSurfer as described
   in the literature. The laterality index (LI) was calculated from the
   independent component (IC) with the highest Jaccard Index (JI) for the
   language mask. Additionally, the authors visually inspected the
   activation maps for two ICs with the highest JIs. The rs-fMRI LI of IC1
   and the authors' image-based subjective interpretation of language
   lateralization were compared with tb-fMRI, which was considered the gold
   standard for this study. RESULTS A retrospective search yielded 33
   patients with language fMRI data. Eight patients were excluded (5 with
   suboptimal tb-fMRI and 3 with suboptimal rs-fMRI data). Twenty-five
   patients (age range 7-19 years, male/female ratio 15:10) were included
   in the study. The language laterality concordance between tb-fMRI and
   rs-fMRI ranged from 68\% to 80\% for assessment based on LI of
   independent component analysis with highest JI and for subjective
   evaluation by visual inspection of activation maps, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS The concordance rates between tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI of 68\% to
   80\% show the limitation of rs-fMRI in determining language dominance.
   Resting-state fMRI should not be used as the sole method for language
   lateralization in clinical practice.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {While resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has gained widespread application in
   neuroimaging clinical research, its penetration into clinical medicine
   has been more limited. We surveyed a neuroradiology professional group
   to ascertain their experience with rs-fMRI, identify perceived barriers
   to using rs-fMRI clinically and elicit suggestions about ways to
   facilitate its use in clinical practice. The electronic survey also
   collected information about demographics and work environment using
   Likert scales. We found that 90\% of the respondents had adequate
   equipment to conduct rs-fMRI and 82\% found rs-fMRI data easy to
   collect. Fifty-nine percent have used rs-fMRI in their past research and
   72\% reported plans to use rs-fMRI for research in the next year.
   Nevertheless, only 40\% plan to use rs-fMRI in clinical practice in the
   next year and 82\% agreed that their clinical fMRI use is largely
   confined to pre-surgical planning applications. To explore the reasons
   for the persistent low utilization of rs-fMRI in clinical applications,
   we identified barriers to clinical rs-fMRI use related to the
   availability of robust denoising procedures, single-subject analysis
   techniques, demonstration of functional connectivity map reliability,
   regulatory clearance, reimbursement, and neuroradiologist training
   opportunities. In conclusion, while rs-fMRI use in clinical
   neuroradiology practice is limited, enthusiasm appears to be quite high
   and there are several possible avenues in which further research and
   development may facilitate its penetration into clinical practice.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the contribution of fMRI- and
   fMRI-EEG-neurofeedback into recovery of motor function in two subacute
   stroke patients during the early post-stroke period. Premotor and
   supplementary motor zones of the cortex were chosen as the targets of
   voluntary control. Patient 1 received 6 sessions of motor imagery-based
   fMRI neurofeedback of secondary motor areas activity and Patient 2
   received a similar course with the addition of mu- and beta-EEG activity
   suppression. Both reduced the motor deficit severity, improved on the
   quality of life, and increased the C3/C4 coherence to other central
   leads within EEG mu-band. Patient 1 reliably increased the fMRI signal
   in target areas and improved on the strength and speed of hand
   movements. Patient 2 (fMRI-EEG) mastered the EEG activity regulation to
   a greater degree. The authors conclude that pure fMRI neurofeedback and
   bi-modal fMRI-EEG neurofeedback produce different clinical effects in
   motor rehabilitation, which confirms the prospect of the closed-loop
   stroke treatment.},

Title = {Assessment of single-vessel cerebral blood velocity by phase contrast
   fMRI},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Current approaches to high-field functional MRI (fMRI) provide 2 means
   to map hemodynamics at the level of single vessels in the brain. One is
   through changes in deoxyhemoglobin in venules, i.e., blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, while the second is through changes in
   arteriole diameter, i.e., cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Here, we
   introduce cerebral blood flow-related velocity-based fMRI, denoted
   CBFv-fMRI, which uses high-resolution phase contrast (PC) MRI to form
   velocity measurements of flow. We use CBFv-fMRI in measure changes in
   blood velocity in single penetrating microvessels across rat parietal
   cortex. In contrast to the venule-dominated BOLD and arteriole-dominated
   CBV fMRI signals, CBFv-fMRI is comparable from both arterioles and
   venules. A single fMRI platform is used to map changes in blood pO(2)
   (BOLD), volume (CBV), and velocity (CBFv). This combined high-resolution
   single-vessel fMRI mapping scheme enables vessel-specific hemodynamic
   mapping in animal models of normal and diseased states and further has
   translational potential to map vascular dementia in diseased or injured
   human brains with ultra-high-field fMRI.},

Title = {Enhanced Thalamic Functional Connectivity with No fMRI Responses to
   Affected Forelimb Stimulation in Stroke-Recovered Rats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Neurological recovery after stroke has been extensively investigated to
   provide better understanding of neurobiological mechanism, therapy, and
   patient management. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques,
   particularly functional MRI (fMRI), have widely contributed to unravel
   the relationship between the altered neural function and stroke-affected
   brain areas. As results of previous investigations, the plastic
   reorganization and/or gradual restoration of the hemodynamic fMRI
   responses to neural stimuli have been suggested as relevant mechanisms
   underlying the stroke recovery process. However, divergent study results
   and modality-dependent outcomes have clouded the proper interpretation
   of variable fMRI signals. Here, we performed both evoked and resting
   state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to clarify the link between the fMRI phenotypes and
   post-stroke functional recovery. The experiments were designed to
   examine the altered neural activity within the contra-lesional
   hemisphere and other undamaged brain regions using rat models with large
   unilateral stroke, which despite the severe injury, exhibited nearly
   full recovery at similar to 6 months after stroke. Surprisingly, both
   blood oxygenation level-dependent and blood volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI
   activities elicited by electrical stimulation of the stroke-affected
   forelimb were completely absent, failing to reveal the neural origin of
   the behavioral recovery. In contrast, the functional connectivity maps
   showed highly robust rs-fMRI activity concentrated in the
   contra-lesional ventromedial nucleus of thalamus (VM). The negative
   finding in the stimuli-induced fMRI study using the popular rat middle
   cerebral artery model denotes weak association between the fMRI
   hemodynamic responses and neurological improvement. The results strongly
   caution the indiscreet interpretation of stroke-affected fMRI signals
   and demonstrate rs-fMRI as a complementary tool for efficiently
   characterizing stroke recovery.},

Abstract = {Despite their wide-spread use, only limited information is available on
   the comparative test-retest reliability of task-based functional and
   resting state magnetic resonance imaging measures of blood oxygen level
   dependence (tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using
   arterial spin labeling. This information is critical to designing
   properly powered longitudinal studies. Here we comprehensively
   quantified and compared the test-retest reliability and reproducibility
   performance of 8 commonly applied fMRI tasks, 6 rs-fMRI metrics and CBF
   in 30 healthy volunteers. We find large variability in test-retest
   reliability performance across the different tb-fMRI paradigms and
   rs-fMRI metrics, ranging from poor to excellent. A larger extent of
   activation in tb-fMRI is linked to higher between-subject reliability of
   the respective task suggesting that differences in the amount of
   activation may be used as a first reliability estimate of novel tb-fMRI
   paradigms. For rs-fMRI, a good reliability of local activity estimates
   is paralleled by poor performance of global connectivity metrics.
   Evaluated CBF measures provide in general a good to excellent
   test-reliability matching or surpassing the best performing tb-fMRI and
   rs-fMRI metrics. This comprehensive effort allows for direct comparisons
   of test-retest reliability between the evaluated MRI domains and
   measures to aid the design of future tb-fMRI, rs-fMRI and CBF studies.},

Title = {Resting fMRI as an alternative for task-based fMRI for language
   lateralization in temporal lobe epilepsy patients: a study using

Abstract = {PurposeOur aim is to investigate whether rs-fMRI can be used as an
   effective technique to study language lateralization. We aim to find out
   the most appropriate language network among different networks
   identified using ICA.MethodsFifteen healthy right-handed subjects,
   sixteen left, and sixteen right temporal lobe epilepsy patients
   prospectively underwent MR scanning in 3T MRI (GE Discovery MR750w),
   using optimized imaging protocol. We obtained task-fMRI data using a
   visual-verb generation paradigm. Rs-fMRI and language-fMRI analysis were
   conducted using FSL software. Independent component analysis (ICA) was
   used to estimate rs-fMRI networks. Dice coefficient was calculated to
   examine the similarity in activated voxels of a common language template
   and the rs-fMRI language networks. Laterality index (LI) was calculated
   from the task-based language activation and rs-fMRI language network,
   for a range of LI thresholds at different z scores.ResultsMeasurement of
   hemispheric language dominance with rs-fMRI was highly concordant with
   task-fMRI results. Among the evaluated z scores for a range of LI
   thresholds, rs-fMRI yielded a maximum accuracy of 95\%, a sensitivity of
   83\%, and specificity of 92.8\% for z=2 at 0.05 LI
   threshold.ConclusionThe present study suggests that rs-fMRI networks
   obtained using ICA technique can be used as an alternative for task-fMRI
   language laterality. The novel aspect of the work is suggestive of
   optimal thresholds while applying rs-fMRI, is an important endeavor
   given that many patients with epilepsy have co-morbid cognitive
   deficits. Thus, an accurate method to determine language laterality
   without requiring a patient to complete the language task would be
   advantageous.},

Title = {Forward models demonstrate that repetition suppression is best modelled

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Inferring neural mechanisms from functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) is challenging because the fMRI signal integrates over millions
   of neurons. One approach is to compare computational models that map
   neural activity to fMRI responses, to see which best predicts fMRI data.
   We use this approach to compare four possible neural mechanisms of fMRI
   adaptation to repeated stimuli (scaling, sharpening, repulsive shifting
   and attractive shifting), acting across three domains (global, local and
   remote). Six features of fMRI repetition effects are identified, both
   univariate and multivariate, from two independent fMRI experiments.
   After searching over parameter values, only the local scaling model can
   simultaneously fit all data features from both experiments. Thus fMRI
   stimulus repetition effects are best captured by down-scaling neuronal
   tuning curves in proportion to the difference between the stimulus and
   neuronal preference. These results emphasise the importance of formal
   modelling for bridging neuronal and fMRI levels of investigation.},

Title = {Presurgical Brain Mapping of the Ventral Somatomotor Network in Patients
   with Brain Tumors Using Resting-State fMRI},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state fMRI readily identifies the dorsal
   but less consistently the ventral somatomotor network. Our aim was to
   assess the relative utility of resting-state fMRI in the identification
   of the ventral somatomotor network via comparison with task-based fMRI
   in patients with brain tumor.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 26 surgically naive patients
   referred for presurgical fMRI brain mapping who had undergone both
   satisfactory ventral motor activation tasks and resting-state fMRI.
   Following standard preprocessing for task-based fMRI and resting-state
   fMRI, general linear model analysis of the ventral motor tasks and
   independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI were performed with
   the number of components set to 20, 30, 40, and 50. Visual overlap of
   task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI at different component levels was
   assessed and categorized as full match, partial match, or no match.
   Rest-versus-task-fMRI concordance was calculated with Dice coefficients
   across varying fMRI thresholds before and after noise removal.
   Multithresholded Dice coefficient volume under the surface was
   calculated.
   RESULTS: The ventral somatomotor network was identified in 81\% of
   patients. At the subject level, better matches between resting-state
   fMRI and task-based fMRI were seen with an increasing order of
   components (53\% of cases for 20 components versus 73\% for 50
   components). Noise-removed group-mean volume under the surface improved
   as component numbers increased from 20 to 50, though ANOVA demonstrated
   no statistically significant difference among the 4 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, the ventral somatomotor network can be
   identified with an increase in the probability of a better match at a
   higher component number. There is variable concordance of the ventral
   `somatomotor network at the single-subject level between resting-state
   and task-based fMRI.},

Title = {Perceived Image Decoding From Brain Activity Using Shared Information of
   Multi-Subject fMRI Data},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {26593-26606},
Abstract = {Decoding a person's cognitive contents from evoked brain activity is
   becoming important in the field of brain-computer interaction. Previous
   studies have decoded a perceived image from functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) activity by constructing brain decoding models
   that were trained with a single subject's fMRI data. However, accurate
   decoding is still challenging since fMRI data acquired from only a
   single subject have several disadvantageous characteristics such as
   small sample size, noisy nature, and high dimensionality. In this
   article, we propose a method to decode categories of perceived images
   from fMRI activity using shared information of multi-subject fMRI data.
   Specifically, by aggregating fMRI data of multiple subjects that contain
   a large number of samples, we extract a low-dimensional latent
   representation shared by multi-subject fMRI data. Then the latent
   representation is nonlinearly transformed into visual features and
   semantic features of the perceived images to identify categories from
   various candidate categories. Our approach leverages rich information
   obtained from multi-subject fMRI data and improves the decoding
   performance. Experimental results obtained by using two public fMRI
   datasets showed that the proposed method can more accurately decode
   categories of perceived images from fMRI activity than previous
   approaches using a single subject's fMRI data.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been a popular approach
   in brain research over the past 20 years. It offers a noninvasive method
   to probe the brain and uses blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   signal changes to access brain function. However, the BOLD signal only
   represents a small fraction of the total MR signal. System instability
   and various noise have a strong impact on the BOLD signal. Additionally,
   fMRI applies fast imaging technique to record brain cognitive process
   over time, requiring high temporal stability of MR scanners.
   Furthermore, data acquisition, image quality, processing, and
   statistical analysis methods also have a great effect on the results of
   fMRI studies. Quality assurance (QA) programs for fMRI can test the
   stability of MR scanners, evaluate the quality of fMRI and help to find
   errors during fMRI scanning, thereby greatly enhancing the success rate
   of fMRI. In this review, we focus on previous studies which developed QA
   programs and methods in SCl/SCIE citation peer-reviewed publications
   over the last 20 years, including topics on existing fMRI QA programs,
   QA phantoms, image QA metrics, quality evaluation of existing
   preprocessing pipelines and fMRI statistical analysis methods. The
   summarized studies were classified into four categories: QA of fMRI
   systems, QA of fMRI data, quality evaluation of data processing
   pipelines and statistical methods and QA of task-related fMRI. Summary
   tables and figures of QA programs and metrics have been developed based
   on the comprehensive review of the literature.},

Abstract = {Both glucose metabolism and resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) signal reflect
   hemodynamic features. The objective of this study was to investigate
   their relationship in the resting-state in healthy elderly participants
   (n = 18). For RS-fMRI signal, regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of
   low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and degree
   of centrality (DC) maps were generated in multiple frequency bands.
   Glucose uptake was acquired with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
   emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear correlation of each pair of the
   FDG-PET and RS-fMRI metrics was explored both in across-voxel way and in
   across-subject way. We found a significant across-voxel correlation
   between the FDG-PET and BOLD-fMRI metrics. However, only a small portion
   of voxels showed significant across-subject correlation between FDG-PET
   and BOLD-fMRI metrics. All these results were similar across all
   frequency bands of RS-fMRI data. The current findings indicate that
   FDG-PET and RS-fMRI metrics share similar spatial pattern (significant
   across-voxel correlation) but have different underlying physiological
   importance (non-significant across-subject correlation). Specifically,
   FDG-PET measures the mean glucose metabolism over tens of minutes, while
   RS-fMRI measures the dynamic characteristics. The combination of FDG-PET
   and RS-fMRI provides complementary information to reveal the underlying
   mechanisms of the brain activity and may enable more comprehensive
   interpretation of clinical PET-fMRI studies. Future studies would
   attempt to reduce the artifacts of RS-fMRI and to analyze the dynamic
   feature of PET signal.},

Title = {Two is better? combining EEG and fMRI for BCI and neurofeedback: a
   systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) are two commonly used non-invasive techniques for measuring brain
   activity in neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Objective.
   In this review, we focus on the use of EEG and fMRI in neurofeedback
   (NF) and discuss the challenges of combining the two modalities to
   improve understanding of brain activity and achieve more effective
   clinical outcomes. Advanced technologies have been developed to
   simultaneously record EEG and fMRI signals to provide a better
   understanding of the relationship between the two modalities. However,
   the complexity of brain processes and the heterogeneous nature of EEG
   and fMRI present challenges in extracting useful information from the
   combined data. Approach. We will survey existing EEG-fMRI combinations
   and recent studies that exploit EEG-fMRI in NF, highlighting the
   experimental and technical challenges. Main results. We made a
   classification of the different combination of EEG-fMRI for NF, we
   provide a review of multimodal analysis methods for EEG-fMRI features.
   We also survey the current state of research on EEG-fMRI in the
   different existing NF paradigms. Finally, we also identify some of the
   remaining challenges in this field. Significance. By exploring EEG-fMRI
   combinations in NF, we are advancing our knowledge of brain function and
   its applications in clinical settings. As such, this review serves as a
   valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in
   the field of neural engineering and rehabilitation, highlighting the
   promising future of EEG-fMRI-based NF.},

Title = {Visual brain activity patterns classification with simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI: A multimodal approach},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {471-485},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Classification of the visual information from the brain
   activity data is a challenging task. Many studies reported in the
   literature are based on the brain activity patterns using either fMRI or
   EEG/MEG only. EEG and fMRI considered as two complementary neuroimaging
   modalities in terms of their temporal and spatial resolution to map the
   brain activity. For getting a high spatial and temporal resolution of
   the brain at the same time, simultaneous EEG-fMRI seems to be fruitful.
   METHODS: In this article, we propose a new method based on simultaneous
   EEG- fMRI data and machine learning approach to classify the visual
   brain activity patterns. We acquired EEG- fMRI data simultaneously on
   the ten healthy human participants by showing them visual stimuli. Data
   fusion approach is used to merge EEG and fMRI data. Machine learning
   classifier is used for the classification purposes.
   RESULTS: Results showed that superior classification performance has
   been achieved with simultaneous EEG- fMRI data as compared to the EEG
   and fMRI data standalone. This shows that multimodal approach improved
   the classification accuracy results as compared with other approaches
   reported in the literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: The proposed simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach for classifying
   the brain activity patterns can be helpful to predict or fully decode
   the brain activity patterns.},

Title = {AUTOMATED RECOGNITION OF DEPRESSION FROM FEWER-SHOT LEANING IN
   RESTING-STATE fMRI WITH ReHo USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Up to now, there is still the absence of research about depression
   recognition using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rest\_fMRI) and deep learning. Previous studies have shown that
   regional homogeneity (ReHo) of rest\_fMRI (rest\_ReHo\_fMRI) is a
   characterization of the functional synchronization of adjacent voxels in
   brain regions, and the mental and behavioral abnormalities in depression
   are due to an imbalance of ReHo synchronization in some brain functional
   areas. Accordingly, this paper presents a method for depression
   recognition using rest\_ReHo\_fMRI. First, the rest\_ReHo\_fMRI is
   extracted from the preprocessed rest-fMRI by calculation. Then, deep
   convolutional networks (such as VGG16) pretrained on ImageNet are used
   to automatically complete extracting the classification features from
   rest\_ReHo\_fMRI. Finally, the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM)
   was used to classify the depression. The results of the test set show
   that the proposed method achieves 89.07\% in sensitivity and 89.74\% in
   specificity. This study suggests that features of rest\_ReHo\_fMRI can
   be used as biomarkers to distinguish depression from normal people.},

Abstract = {Changes in brain activity accompanying shifts in vigilance and arousal
   can interfere with the study of other intrinsic and task-evoked
   characteristics of brain function. However, the difficulty of tracking
   and modeling the arousal state during functional MRI (fMRI) typically
   precludes the assessment of arousal-dependent influences on fMRI
   signals. Here we combine fMRI, electrophysiology, and the monitoring of
   eyelid behavior to demonstrate an approach for tracking continuous
   variations in arousal level from fMRI data. We first characterize the
   spatial distribution of fMRI signal fluctuations that track a measure of
   behavioral arousal; taking this pattern as a template, and using the
   local field potential as a simultaneous and independent measure of
   cortical activity, we observe that the time-varying expression level of
   this template in fMRI data provides a close approximation of
   electrophysiological arousal. We discuss the potential benefit of these
   findings for increasing the sensitivity of fMRI as a cognitive and
   clinical biomarker.},

Title = {Resting-State Functional MRI for Determining Language Lateralization in
   Children with Drug-Resistant Epilepsy},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Task-based fMRI is a noninvasive method of
   determining language dominance; however, not all children can complete
   language tasks due to age, cognitive/intellectual, or language barriers.
   Task-free approaches such as resting-state fMRI offer an alternative
   method. This study evaluated resting-state fMRI for predicting language
   laterality in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. MATERIALS AND
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 43 children with drug-resistant
   epilepsy who had undergone resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI during
   presurgical evaluation was conducted. Independent component analysis of
   resting-state fMRI was used to identify language networks by comparing
   the independent components with a language network template. Concordance
   rates in language laterality between resting-state fMRI and each of the
   4 task-based fMRI language paradigms (auditory description decision,
   auditory category, verbal fluency, and silent word generation tasks)
   were calculated. RESULTS: Concordance ranged from 0.64 (95\% CI,
   0.48?0.65) to 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.58?0.87), depending on the language
   paradigm, with the highest concordance found for the auditory
   description decision task. Most (78\%?83\%) patients identified as
   left-lateralized on task-based fMRI were correctly classified as
   left-lateralized on resting-state fMRI. No patients classified as
   right-lateralized or bilateral on task-based fMRI were correctly
   classified by resting-state fMRI. CONCLUSIONS: While resting-state fMRI
   correctly classified most patients who had typical (left) language
   dominance, its ability to correctly classify patients with atypical
   (right or bilateral) language dominance was poor. Further study is
   required before resting-state fMRI can be used clinically for language
   mapping in the context of epilepsy surgery evaluation in children with
   drug-resistant epilepsy.},

Abstract = {This study provides first data about the spatial variability of fMRI
   sensorimotor localizations when investigating the same subjects at
   different fMRI sites. Results are comparable to a previous patient
   study. We found a median between-site variability of about 6 mm
   independent of task (motor or sensory) and experimental standardization
   (high or low). An intraclass correlation coefficient analysis using data
   quality measures indicated a major influence of the fMRI site on
   variability. In accordance with this, within-site localization
   variability was considerably lower (about 3 mm). We conclude that the
   fMRI site is a considerable confound for localization of brain activity.
   However, when performed by experienced clinical fMRI experts, brain
   pathology does not seem to have a relevant impact on the reliability of
   fMRI localizations. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Multi-echo fMRI: A review of applications in fMRI denoising and analysis
   of BOLD signals},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {59-80},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {In recent years the field of fMRI research has enjoyed expanded
   technical abilities related to resolution, as well as use across many
   fields of brain research. At the same time, the field has also dealt
   with uncertainty related to many known and unknown effects of artifact
   in fMRI data. In this review we discuss an emerging fMRI technology,
   called multi-echo (ME)-fMRI, which focuses on improving the fidelity and
   interpretability of fMRI. Where the essential problem of standard
   single-echo fMRI is the indeterminacy of sources of signals, whether
   BOLD or artifact, this is not the case for ME-fMRI. By acquiring
   multiple echo images per slice, the ME approach allows T-2{*} decay to
   be modeled at every voxel at every time point. Since BOLD signals arise
   by changes in T-2{*} over time, an fMRI experiment sampling the T-2{*}
   signal decay can be analyzed to distinguish BOLD from artifact signal
   constituents. While the ME approach has a long history of use in
   theoretical and validation studies, modern MRI systems enable
   whole-brain multi-echo fMRI at high resolution. This review covers
   recent multi-echo fMRI acquisition methods, and the analysis steps for
   this data to make fMRI at once more principled, straightforward, and
   powerful. After a brief overview of history and theory, T-2{*} modeling
   and applications will be discussed. These applications include T-2{*}
   mapping and combining echoes from ME data to increase BOLD contrast and
   mitigate dropout artifacts. Next, the modeling of fMRI signal changes to
   detect signal origins in BOLD-related T-2{*} versus artifact-related So
   changes will be reviewed. A focus is on the use of ME-fMRI data to
   extract and classify components from spatial ICA, called multi-echo ICA
   (ME-ICA). After describing how ME-fMRI and ME-ICA lead to a general
   model for analysis of fMRI signals, applications in animal and human
   imaging will be discussed. Applications include removing motion
   artifacts in resting state data at subject and group level. New imaging
   methods such as multi-band multi-echo fMRI and imaging at 7 T are
   demonstrated throughout the review, and a practical analysis pipeline is
   described. The review culminates with evidence from recent studies of
   major boosts in statistical power from using multi-echo fMRI for
   detecting activation and connectivity in healthy individuals and
   patients with neuropsychiatric disease. In conclusion, the review shows
   evidence that the multi-echo approach expands the range of experiments
   that is practicable using fMRI. These findings suggest a compelling
   future role of the multi-echo approach in subject-level and clinical
   fMRI.},

Abstract = {Dynamic fMRI responses vary largely according to the physiological
   conditions of animals either under anesthesia or in awake states. We
   developed a real-time fMRI platform to guide experimenters to monitor
   fMRI responses instantaneously during acquisition, which can be used to
   modify the physiology of animals to achieve desired hemodynamic
   responses in animal brains. The real-time fMRI set-up is based on a
   14.1T preclinical MRI system, enabling the real-time mapping of dynamic
   fMRI responses in the primary forepaw somatosensory cortex (FP-S1) of
   anesthetized rats. Instead of a retrospective analysis to investigate
   confounding sources leading to the variability of fMRI signals, the
   real-time fMRI platform provides a more effective scheme to identify
   dynamic fMRI responses using customized macro-functions and a common
   neuroimage analysis software in the MRI system. Also, it provides
   immediate troubleshooting feasibility and a real-time biofeedback
   stimulation paradigm for brain functional studies in animals.},

Abstract = {Eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers were prospectively evaluated
   with resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI to assess language networks.
   The laterality indices of Broca and Wernicke areas were calculated by
   using task-based fMRI via a voxel-value approach. The authors performed
   seed-based resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis together with
   parameters such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and fractional
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). fALFF can be used as an
   alternative to task-based fMRI for assessing language laterality. There
   was a strong positive correlation between the fALFF of the Broca area of
   resting-state fMRI with the laterality index of task-based fMRI.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Language is a cardinal function that makes human
   unique. Preservation of language function poses a great challenge for
   surgeons during resection. The aim of the study was to assess the
   efficacy of resting-state fMRI in the lateralization of language
   function in healthy subjects to permit its further testing in patients
   who are unable to perform task-based fMRI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers were
   prospectively evaluated with resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI to
   assess language networks. The laterality indices of Broca and Wernicke
   areas were calculated by using task-based fMRI via a voxel-value
   approach. We adopted seed-based resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis
   together with parameters such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation
   and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF).
   Resting-state fMRI connectivity maps for language networks were obtained
   from Broca and Wernicke areas in both hemispheres. We performed
   correlation analysis between the laterality index and the z scores of
   functional connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, and
   fALFF.
   RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis between signals obtained from the
   z score of fALFF and the laterality index yielded a correlation
   coefficient of 0.849 (P < .05). Regression analysis of the fALFF with
   the laterality index yielded an R-2 value of 0.721, indicating that
   72.1\% of the variance in the laterality index of task-based fMRI could
   be predicted from the fALFF of resting-state fMRI.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that fALFF can be used as an
   alternative to task-based fMRI for assessing language laterality. There
   was a strong positive correlation between the fALFF of the Broca area of
   resting-state fMRI with the laterality index of task-based fMRI.
   Furthermore, we demonstrated the efficacy of fALFF for predicting the
   laterality of task-based fMRI.},

Abstract = {Film functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has gained tremendous
   popularity in many areas of neuroscience. However, affective
   neuroscience remains somewhat behind in embracing this approach, even
   though films lend themselves to study how brain function gives rise to
   complex, dynamic and multivariate emotions. Here, we discuss the unique
   capabilities of film fMRI for emotion research, while providing a
   general guide of conducting such research. We first give a brief
   overview of emotion theories as these inform important design choices.
   Next, we discuss films as experimental paradigms for emotion elicitation
   and address the process of annotating them. We then situate film fMRI in
   the context of other fMRI approaches, and present an overview of results
   from extant studies so far with regard to advantages of film fMRI. We
   also give an overview of state-of-the-art analysis techniques including
   methods that probe neurodynamics. Finally, we convey limitations of
   using film fMRI to study emotion. In sum, this review offers a
   practitioners' guide to the emerging field of film fMRI and underscores
   how it can advance affective neuroscience.},

Abstract = {Neurofeedback relying on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-nf)
   heralds new prospects for self-regulating brain and behavior. Here we
   provide the first comprehensive review of the fMRI-nf literature and the
   first systematic database of fMRI-nf findings. We synthesize information
   from 99 fMRI-nf experiments-the bulk of currently available data. The
   vast majority of fMRI-nf findings suggest that self-regulation of
   specific brain signatures seems viable; however, replication of
   concomitant behavioral outcomes remains sparse. To disentangle placebo
   influences and establish the specific effects of neurofeedback, we
   highlight the need for double-blind placebo-controlled studies alongside
   rigorous and standardized statistical analyses. Before fMRI-nf can join
   the clinical armamentarium, research must first confirm the
   sustainability, transferability, and feasibility of fMRI-nf in patients
   as well as in healthy individuals. Whereas modulating specific brain
   activity promises to mold cognition, emotion, thought, and action,
   reducing complex mental health issues to circumscribed brain regions may
   represent a tenuous goal. We can certainly change brain activity with
   fMRI-nf. However, it remains unclear whether such changes translate into
   meaningful behavioral improvements in the clinical domain.},

Title = {Impact of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging on Clinical Outcomes in
   a Propensity-Matched Low Grade Glioma Cohort},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {E1143-E1148},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the impact of preoperative
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on clinical outcomes in
   patients with low grade glioma (LGG).
   METHODS: In a retrospective propensity-matched cohort study, we compared
   patients with LGG based on whether they underwent fMRI as part of
   preoperative assessment. Twelve patients with LGG who underwent
   preoperative fMRI were selected, and a contemporaneous group of 12
   control patients with LGG who did not undergo fMRI were matched to the
   fMRI group based on age, sex, and 1p/19q status.
   RESULTS: fMRI group subjects tended to have more aggressive surgeries
   (67\% resection, 33\% biopsy) than the control group (33\% resection,
   67\% biopsy). There were no significant differences in outcomes between
   the 2 groups. Time between clinical assessment and surgery tended to be
   longer in the fMRI group (6.3 +/- 4.2 weeks) than in the control group
   (2.7 +/- 2.2 weeks). Extent of resection was similar between the 2
   cohorts. fMRI group subjects had lower preoperative functional status
   and tended to have a greater postoperative functional status improvement
   than control group subjects. Mean survival was not significantly
   different (fMRI group 5-year survival: 88.9\%, control group 5-year
   survival: 61.1\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the impact of preoperative fMRI in patients
   with LGG in this propensity-matched cohort study. This study has not
   demonstrated any significant difference in outcomes between the fMRI and
   control groups; however, there were nonsignificant trends for patients
   who underwent fMRI to undergo more aggressive surgical interventions and
   have a greater postoperative functional status improvement.},

Abstract = {Background:Pre-surgical functional localization of eloquent cortex with
   task-based functional MRI (T-fMRI) is part of the current standard of
   care prior to resection of brain tumors. Resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) is
   an alternative method currently under investigation. Here, we compare
   group level language localization using T-fMRI vs. RS-fMRI analyzed with
   3D deep convolutional neural networks (3DCNN). Methods:We analyzed data
   obtained in 35 patients with brain tumors that had both language T-fMRI
   and RS-MRI scans during pre-surgical evaluation. The T-fMRI data were
   analyzed using conventional techniques. The language associated resting
   state network was mapped using a 3DCNN previously trained with data
   acquired in >2,700 normal subjects. Group level results obtained by both
   methods were evaluated using receiver operator characteristic analysis
   of probability maps of language associated regions, taking as ground
   truth meta-analytic maps of language T-fMRI responses generated on the
   Neurosynth platform. Results:Both fMRI methods localized major
   components of the language system (areas of Broca and Wernicke).
   Word-stem completion T-fMRI strongly activated Broca's area but also
   several task-general areas not specific to language. RS-fMRI provided a
   more specific representation of the language system. Conclusion:3DCNN
   was able to accurately localize the language network. Additionally,
   3DCNN performance was remarkably tolerant of a limited quantity of
   RS-fMRI data.},

Title = {Method for spatial overlap estimation of electroencephalography and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging responses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {328},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Background. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements may represent activity
   from partially divergent neural sources, but this factor is seldom
   modeled in fMRI-EEG data integration.
   New method. This paper proposes an approach to estimate the spatial
   overlap between sources of activity measured simultaneously with fMRI
   and EEG. Following the extraction of task-related activity, the key
   steps include, 1) distributed source reconstruction of the task-related
   ERP activity (ERP source model), 2) transformation of fMRI activity to
   the ERP spatial scale by forward modelling of the scalp potential field
   distribution and backward source reconstruction (fMRI source
   simulation), and 3) optimization of fMRI and ERP thresholds to maximize
   spatial overlap without a priori constraints of coupling (overlap
   calculation).
   Results: FMRI and ERP responses were recorded simultaneously in 15
   subjects performing an auditory oddball task. A high degree of spatial
   overlap between sources of fMRI and ERP responses (in 9 or more of 15
   subjects) was found specifically within temporoparietal areas associated
   with the task. Areas of non-overlap in fMRI and ERP sources were
   relatively small and inconsistent across subjects.
   Comparison with existing method: The ERP and fMRI sources estimated with
   solely jICA overlapped in just 4 of 15 subjects, and strictly in the
   parietal cortex.
   Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the new fMRI-ERP spatial overlap
   estimation method provides greater spatiotemporal detail of the cortical
   dynamics than solely jICA. As such, we propose that it is a superior
   method for the integration of fMRI and EEG to study brain function.},

Abstract = {Multimodal functional neuroimaging by combining functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) or
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) is able to provide high spatiotemporal
   resolution mapping of brain activity. However, the accuracy of
   fMRI-constrained EEG/MEG source imaging may be degraded by potential
   spatial mismatches between the locations of fMRI activation and
   electrical source activities. To address this problem, we propose a
   novel fMRI informed time-variant constraint (FITC) method. The weights
   in FITC are determined by combining the fMRI activities and electrical
   source activities in a time-variant manner to reduce the impact of the
   fMRI extra sources. The fMRI weights are modified using cross-talk
   matrix and normalized partial area under the curve to reduce the impact
   of fMRI missing sources. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to
   compare the source estimates produced by L2-minimum norm estimation
   (MNE), fMRI-weighted minimum norm estimation (fMNE), FITC, and
   depth-weighted FITC (wFITC) algorithms with various spatial mismatch
   conditions. Localization error and temporal correlation were calculated
   to compare the four algorithms under different conditions. The
   simulation results indicated that the FITC and wFITC methods were more
   robust than the MNE and fMNE algorithms. Moreover, FITC and wFITC were
   significantly better than fMNE under the fMRI missing sources condition.
   A human visual-stimulus EEG, MEG, and fMRI test was performed, and the
   experimental data revealed that FITC and wFITC displayed more focal
   areas than fMNE and MNE. In conclusion, the proposed FITC method is able
   to better resolve the spatial mismatch problems encountered in
   fMRI-constrained EEG/MEG source imaging.},

Title = {Identification of the Somatomotor Network from Language Task-based fMRI
   Compared with Resting-State fMRI in Patients with Brain Lesions},
Journal = {RADIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a potential
   alternative to task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) for somatomotor
   network (SMN) identification. Brain networks can also be generated from
   tb-fMRI by using independent component analysis (ICA).
   Purpose: To investigate whether the SMN can be identified by using ICA
   from a language task without a motor component, the sentence completion
   functional MRI (sc-fMRI) task, compared with rs-fMRI.
   Materials and Methods: The sc-fMRI and rs-fMRI scans in patients who
   underwent presurgical brain mapping between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed,
   using the same imaging parameters (other than scanning time) on a 3.0-T
   MRI scanner. ICA was performed on rs-fMRI and sc-fMRI scans with use of
   a tool to separate data sets into their spatial and temporal components.
   Two neuroradiologists independently determined the presence of the
   dorsal SMN (dSMN) and ventral SMN (vSMN) on each study. Groups were
   compared by using t tests, and logistic regression was performed to
   identify predictors of the presence of SMNs.
   Results: One hundred patients (mean age, 40.9 years. 14.8 {[}standard
   deviation]; 61 men) were evaluated. The dSMN and vSMN were identified in
   86\% (86 of 100) and 76\% (76 of 100) of rs-fMRI scans and 85\% (85 of
   100) and 69\% (69 of 100) of sc-fMRI scans, respectively. The
   concordance between rs-fMRI and sc-fMRI for presence of dSMN and vSMN
   was 75\% (75 of 100 patients) and 53\% (53 of 100 patients),
   respectively. In 10 of 14 patients (71\%) where rs-fMRI did not show the
   dSMN, sc-fMRI demonstrated it. This rate was 67\% for the vSMN (16 of 24
   patients).
   Conclusion: In the majority of patients, independent component analysis
   of sentence completion task functional MRI scans reliably demonstrated
   the somatomotor network compared with resting-state functional MRI
   scans. Identifying target networks with a single sentence completion
   scan could reduce overall functional MRI scanning times by eliminating
   the need for separate motor tasks. (C) RSNA, 2021},

Title = {Unimodal Versus Bimodal EEG-fMRI Neurofeedback of a Motor Imagery Task},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Neurofeedback is a promising tool for brain rehabilitation and peak
   performance training. Neurofeedback approaches usually rely on a single
   brain imaging modality such as EEG or fMRI. Combining these modalities
   for neurofeedback training could allow to provide richer information to
   the subject and could thus enable him/her to achieve faster and more
   specific self-regulation. Yet unimodal and multimodal neurofeedback have
   never been compared before. In the present work, we introduce a
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI experimental protocol in which participants
   performed a motor-imagery task in unimodal and bimodal NF conditions.
   With this protocol we were able to compare for the first time the
   effects of unimodal EEG-neurofeedback and fMRI-neurofeedback versus
   bimodal EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback by looking both at EEG and fMRI
   activations. We also propose a new feedback metaphor for bimodal
   EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback that integrates both EEG and fMRI signal in a
   single bi-dimensional feedback (a ball moving in 2D). Such a feedback is
   intended to relieve the cognitive load of the subject by presenting the
   bimodal neurofeedback task as a single regulation task instead of two.
   Additionally, this integrated feedback metaphor gives flexibility on
   defining a bimodal neurofeedback target. Participants were able to
   regulate activity in their motor regions in all NF conditions. Moreover,
   motor activations as revealed by offline fMRI analysis were stronger
   during EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback than during EEG-neurofeedback. This result
   suggests that EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback could be more specific or more
   engaging than EEG-neurofeedback. Our results also suggest that during
   EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback, participants tended to regulate more the
   modality that was harder to control. Taken together our results shed
   first light on the specific mechanisms of bimodal EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback
   and on its added-value as compared to unimodal EEG-neurofeedback and
   fMRI-neurofeedback.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is commonly thought to be
   too slow to capture any neural dynamics faster than 0.1 Hz. However,
   recent findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting fMRI activity
   at higher frequencies beyond 0.2 Hz. The origin, reliability, and
   generalizability of fast fMRI responses are still under debate and await
   confirmation through animal experiments with fMRI and invasive
   electrophysiology. Here, we acquired single-echo and multi-echo fMRI, as
   well as local field potentials, from anesthetized rat brains given
   gastric electrical stimulation modulated at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 Hz. Such
   gastric stimuli could drive widespread fMRI responses at corresponding
   frequencies from the somatosensory and cingulate cortices. Such fast
   fMRI responses were linearly dependent on echo times and thus indicative
   of blood oxygenation level dependent nature (BOLD). Local field
   potentials recorded during the same gastric stimuli revealed transient
   and phase-locked broadband neural responses, preceding the fMRI
   responses by as short as 0.5 s. Taken together, these results suggest
   that gastric stimulation can drive widespread and rapid fMRI responses
   of BOLD and neural origin, lending support to the feasibility of using
   fMRI to detect rapid changes in neural activity up to 0.8 Hz under
   visceral stimulation.},

Abstract = {Purpose Patients with Moyamoya Angiopathy (MMA) require hemodynamic
   evaluation to assess the risk of stroke. Assessment of cerebral blood
   flow with {[}O-15]water PET and acetazolamide challenge is the
   diagnostic standard for the evaluation of the cerebral perfusion reserve
   (CPR). Estimation of the cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) by use of
   breath-hold-triggered fMRI (bh-fMRI) as an index of CPR has been
   proposed as a reliable and more readily available approach. Recent
   findings suggest the use of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) which requires
   minimum patient compliance. The aim of this study was to compare rs-fMRI
   to bh-fMRI and {[}O-15]water PET in patients with MMA. Methods Patients
   with MMA underwent rs-fMRI and bh-fMRI in the same MRI session. Maps of
   the CVR gained by both modalities were compared retrospectively by
   calculating the correlation between the mean CVR of 12 volumes of
   interest. Additionally, the rs-maps of a subgroup of patients were
   compared to CPR-maps gained by {[}O-15]water PET. Results The comparison
   of the rs-maps and the bh-maps of 24 patients revealed a good
   correlation (Pearson's r = 0.71 +/- 0.13; preoperative patients:
   Pearson's r = 0.71 +/- 0.17; postoperative patients: Pearson's r = 0.71
   +/- 0.11). The comparison of 7 rs-fMRI data sets to the corresponding
   {[}O-15]water PET data sets also revealed a high level of agreement
   (Pearson's r = 0.80 +/- 0.19). Conclusion The present analysis indicates
   that rs-fMRI might be a promising non-invasive method with almost no
   patient cooperation needed to evaluate the CVR. Further prospective
   studies are required.},

Abstract = {Bipolar disorders (BDs) represent one of the leading causes of
   disability and morbidity globally. The use of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is being increasingly studied as a tool to
   improve the diagnosis and treatment of BDs. While morphological
   biomarkers can be identified through the use of structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (sMRI), recent studies have demonstrated that varying
   degrees of both structural and functional impairments indicate differing
   bipolar subtypes. Within fMRI, resting-state fMRI has specifically drawn
   increased interest for its capability to detect different neuronal
   activation patterns compared to task-based fMRI. This study aims to
   review recently published literature regarding the use of fMRI to
   investigate structural-functional relationships in BD diagnosis and
   specifically resting-state fMRI to provide an opinion on fMRI's modern
   clinical application. All sources in this literature review were
   collected through searches on both PubMed and Google Scholar databases
   for terms such as `resting-state fMRI' and `functional neuroimaging
   biomarkers of bipolar disorder'. While there are promising results
   supporting the use of fMRI for improving differential accuracy and
   establishing clinically relevant biomarkers, additional evidence will be
   required before fMRI is considered a dependable component of the overall
   BD diagnostic process.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 21},
Abstract = {Neuronal activation sequence information is essential for understanding
   brain functions. Extracting such timing information from
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) signals is confounded by local cerebral vascular reactivity
   (CVR), which varies across brain locations. Thus, detecting neuronal
   synchrony as well as inferring inter-regional causal modulation using
   fMRI signals can be biased. Here we used fast fMRI measurements sampled
   at 10 Hz to measure the fMRI latency difference between visual and
   sensorimotor areas when participants engaged in a visuomotor task. The
   regional fMRI timing was calibrated by subtracting the CVR latency
   measured by a breath-holding task. After CVR calibration, the fMRI
   signal at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) preceded that at the
   visual cortex by 496 ms, followed by the fMRI signal at the sensorimotor
   cortex with a latency of 464 ms. Sequential LGN, visual, and
   sensorimotor cortex activations were found in each participant after the
   CVR calibration. These inter-regional fMRI timing differences across and
   within participants were more closely related to the reaction time after
   the CVR calibration. Our results suggested the feasibility of mapping
   brain activity using fMRI with accuracy in hundreds of milliseconds.},

Title = {Sensitivity of Neuroimaging Indicators in Monitoring the Effects of
   Interferon Gamma Treatment in Friedreich's Ataxia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {The identification of efficient markers of disease progression and
   response to possibly effective treatments is a key priority for slowly
   progressive, rare and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Friedreich's
   ataxia. Various imaging modalities have documented specific
   abnormalities in Friedreich's ataxia that could be tracked to provide
   useful indicators of efficacy in clinical trials. Advanced MRI imaging
   (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; functional MRI, fMRI; and resting-state
   fMRI, rs-fMRI) and retinal imaging (optical coherence tomography, OCT)
   were tested longitudinally in a small group of Friedreich's ataxia
   patients participating in an open-label clinical trial testing the
   safety and the efficacy of 6-month treatment with interferon gamma.
   While the DTI indices documented the slow progression of fractional
   anisotropy loss, fMRI and rs-fMRI were significantly modified during and
   after treatment. The fMRI changes significantly correlated with the
   Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, which is used to monitor
   clinical response. OCT documented the known thickness reduction of the
   retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, but there was no change over time.
   This pilot study provides indications for the potential utility of fMRI
   and rs-fMRI as ancillary measures in clinical trials for Friedreich's
   ataxia.},

Title = {Preoperative functional MRI use in neurooncology patients: a clinician
   survey},
Journal = {NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Functional MRI (fMRI) is increasingly being investigated for
   use in neurosurgical patient care. In the current study, the authors
   characterize the clinical use of fMRI by surveying neurosurgeons' use of
   and attitudes toward fMRI as a surgical planning tool in neurooncology
   patients.
   METHODS A survey was developed to inquire about clinicians' use of and
   experiences with preoperative fMRI in the neurooncology patient
   population, including example case images. The survey was distributed to
   all neurosurgical departments with a residency program in the US.
   RESULTS After excluding incomplete surveys and responders that do not
   use fMRI (n = 11), 50 complete responses were included in the final
   analysis. Responders were predominantly from academic programs (88\%),
   with 20 years or more in practice (40\%), with a main area of practice
   in neurooncology (48\%) and treating an adult population (90\%). All 50
   responders currently use fMRI in neurooncology patients, mostly for low-
   (94\%) and high-grade glioma (82\%). The leading decision factors for
   ordering fMRI were location of mass in dominant hemisphere, location in
   a functional area, motor symptoms, and aphasia. Across 10 cases,
   language fMRI yielded the highest interrater reliability agreement
   (Fleiss' kappa 0.437). The most common reasons for ordering fMRI were to
   identify language laterality, plan extent of resection, and discuss
   neurological risks with patients. Clinicians reported that fMRI results
   were not obtained when ordered a median 10\% of the time and were
   suboptimal a median 27\% of the time. Of responders, 70\% reported that
   they had ever resected an fMRI-positive functional site, of whom 77\%
   did so because the site was ``cleared{''} by cortical stimulation.
   Responders reported disagreement between fMRI and awake surgery 30\% of
   the time. Overall, 98\% of responders reported that if results of fMRI
   and intraoperative mapping disagreed, they would rely on intraoperative
   mapping.
   CONCLUSIONS Although fMRI is increasingly being adopted as a practical
   preoperative planning tool for brain tumor resection, there remains a
   substantial degree of discrepancy with regard to its current use and
   presumed utility. There is a need for further research to evaluate the
   use of preoperative fMRI in neurooncology patients. As fMRI continues to
   gain prominence, it will be important for clinicians to collectively
   share best practices and develop guidelines for the use of fMRI in the
   preoperative planning phase of brain tumor patients.},

Title = {The use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in functional
   magnetic resonance imaging-A systematic review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is presently one of the
   most popular techniques for analysing the dynamic states in brain images
   using various kinds of algorithms. From the last decade, there is an
   exponential rise in the use of the machine and deep learning algorithms
   of artificial intelligence for analysing fMRI data. However, it is a big
   challenge for every researcher to choose a suitable machine or deep
   learning algorithm for analysing fMRI data due to the availability of a
   large number of algorithms in the literature. It takes much time for
   each researcher to know about the various approaches and algorithms
   which are in use for fMRI data. This paper provides a review in a
   systematic manner for the present literature of fMRI data that makes use
   of the machine and deep learning algorithms. The major goals of this
   review paper are to (a) identify machine learning and deep learning
   research trends for the implementation of fMRI; (b) identify usage of
   Machine Learning Algorithms and deep learning in fMRI, and (c) help new
   researchers based on fMRI to put their new findings appropriately in
   existing domain of fMRI research. The results of this systematic review
   identified various fMRI studies and classified them based on fMRI types,
   mental diseases, use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
   The authors have provided the studies with the best performance of
   machine learning and deep learning algorithms used in fMRI. The authors
   believe that this systematic review will help incoming researchers on
   fMRI in their future works.},

Title = {Mapping stress networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging in
   awake animals},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF STRESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {251-263},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The neurobiology of stress is studied through behavioral neuroscience,
   endocrinology, neuronal morphology and neurophysiology. There is a shift
   in focus toward progressive changes throughout stress paradigms and
   individual susceptibility to stress that requires methods that allow for
   longitudinal study design and study of individual differences in stress
   response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with the
   advantages of noninvasiveness and a large field of view, can be used for
   functionally mapping brain-wide regions and circuits critical to the
   stress response, making it suitable for longitudinal studies and
   understanding individual variability of short-term and long-term
   consequences of stress exposure. In addition, fMRI can be applied to
   both animals and humans, which is highly valuable in translating
   findings across species and examining whether the physiology and neural
   circuits involved in the stress response are conserved in mammals.
   However, compared to human fMRI studies, there are a number of factors
   that are essential for the success of fMRI studies in animals. This
   review discussed the use of fMRI in animal studies of stress. It
   reviewed advantages, challenges and technical considerations of the
   animal fMRI methodology as well as recent literature of stress studies
   using fMRI in animals. It also highlighted the development of combining
   fMRI with other methods and the future potential of fMRI in animal
   studies of stress. We conclude that animal fMRI studies, with their
   flexibility, low cost and short time frame compared to human studies,
   are crucial to advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of
   stress.},

Title = {Quantitative Analyses Help in Choosing Between Simultaneous vs. Separate
   EEG and fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Simultaneous registration of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is considered an attractive
   approach for studying brain function non-invasively. It combines the
   better spatial resolution of fMRI with the better temporal resolution of
   EEG, but comes at the cost of increased measurement artifact and the
   accompanying artifact preprocessing. This paper presents a study of the
   residual signal quality based on temporal signal to noise ratio (TSNR)
   for fMRI and fast Fourier transform (FFT) for EEG, after optimized
   conventional signal preprocessing. Measurements outside the magnetic
   resonance imaging scanner and inside the scanner prior to and during
   image acquisition were compared. For EEG, frequency and region dependent
   significant effects on FFT squared amplitudes were observed between
   separately vs. simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI, with larger effects
   during image acquisition than without image acquisition inside the
   scanner bore. A graphical user interface was developed to aid in quality
   checking these measurements. For fMRI, separately recorded EEG-fMRI
   revealed relatively large areas with a significantly higher TSNR in
   right occipital and parietal regions and in the cingulum, compared to
   separately recorded EEG-fMRI. Simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI showed
   significantly higher TSNR in inferior occipital cortex, diencephalon and
   brainstem, compared to separately recorded EEG-fMRI. Quantification of
   EEG and fMRI signals showed significant, but sometimes subtle, changes
   between separate compared to simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements. To
   avoid interference with the experiment of interest in a simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI measurement, it seems warranted to perform a quantitative
   evaluation to ensure that there are no such uncorrectable effects
   present in regions or frequencies that are of special interest to the
   research question at hand.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Translational neuroscience is an important field that brings together
   clinical praxis with neuroscience methods. In this review article, the
   focus will be on functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and its applicability in
   clinical fMRI studies. In the light of the ``replication crisis,{''}
   three aspects will be critically discussed: First, the fMRI signal
   itself, second, current fMRI praxis, and, third, the next generation of
   analysis strategies. Current attempts such as resting-state fMRI,
   meta-analyses, and machine learning will be discussed with their
   advantages and potential pitfalls and disadvantages. One major concern
   is that the fMRI signal shows substantial within- and between-subject
   variability, which affects the reliability of both task-related, but in
   particularly resting-state fMRI studies. Furthermore, the lack of
   standardized acquisition and analysis methods hinders the further
   development of clinical relevant approaches. However, meta-analyses and
   machine-learning approaches may help to overcome current shortcomings in
   the methods by identifying new, and yet hidden relationships, and may
   help to build new models on disorder mechanisms. Furthermore, better
   control of parameters that may have an influence on the fMRI signal and
   that can easily be controlled for, like blood pressure, heart rate,
   diet, time of day, might improve reliability substantially.},

Title = {Organizing Variables Affecting fMRI Estimates of Language Dominance in
   Patients with Brain Tumors},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Numerous variables can affect the assessment of language dominance using
   presurgical functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) in patients with brain
   tumors. This work organizes the variables into confounding and
   modulating factors. Confounding factors give the appearance of changed
   language dominance. Most confounding factors are fMRI-specific and they
   can substantially disrupt the evaluation of language dominance.
   Confounding factors can be divided into two categories: tumor-related
   and fMRI analysis. The tumor-related confounds further subdivide into
   tumor characteristics (e.g., tumor grade) and tumor-induced conditions
   (aphasia). The fMRI analysis confounds represent technical aspects of
   fMRI methods (e.g., a fixed versus an individual threshold). Modulating
   factors can modify language dominance without confounding it. They are
   not fMRI-specific, and they can impact language dominance both in
   healthy individuals and neurosurgical patients. The effect of most
   modulating factors on fMRI language dominance is smaller than that of
   confounding factors. Modulating factors include demographics (e.g., age)
   and linguistic variables (e.g., early bilingualism). Three cases of
   brain tumors in the left hemisphere are presented to illustrate how
   modulating confounding and modulating factors can impact fMRI estimates
   of language dominance. Distinguishing between confounding and modulating
   factors can help interpret the results of presurgical language mapping
   with fMRI.},

Title = {ReStNeuMap: a tool for automatic extraction of resting-state functional

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) represents a promising
   and cost-effective alternative to task-based fMRI for presurgical
   mapping. However, the lack of clinically streamlined and reliable
   rs-fMRI analysis tools has prevented wide adoption of this technique. In
   this work, the authors introduce an rs-fMRI processing pipeline
   (ReStNeuMap) for automatic single-patient rs-fMRI network analysis.
   METHODS The authors provide a description of the rs-fMRI network
   analysis steps implemented in ReStNeuMap and report their initial
   experience with this tool after performing presurgical mapping in 6
   patients. They verified the spatial agreement between rs-fMRI networks
   derived by ReStNeuMap and localization of activation with intraoperative
   direct electrical stimulation (DES).
   RESULTS The authors automatically extracted rs-fMRI networks including
   eloquent cortex in spatial proximity with the resected lesion in all
   patients. The distance between DES points and corresponding rs-fMRI
   networks was less than 1 cm in 78\% of cases for motor, 100\% of cases
   for visual, 87.5\% of cases for language, and 100\% of cases for speech
   articulation mapping.
   CONCLUSIONS The authors' initial experience with ReStNeuMap showed good
   spatial agreement between presurgical rs-fMRI predictions and DES
   findings during awake surgery. The availability of the rs-fMRI analysis
   tools for clinicians aiming to perform noninvasive mapping of brain
   functional networks may extend its application beyond surgical practice.},

Abstract = {Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been used to non-invasively localize the
   human motor functional area. These locations can be clinically used as
   stimulation target of TMS treatment. However, it has been reported that
   the finger tapping fMRI activation and TMS hotspot were not
   well-overlapped. The aim of the current study was to measure the
   distance between the finger tapping fMRI activation and the TMS hotspot,
   and more importantly, to compare the network difference by using
   resting-state fMRI. Thirty healthy participants underwent resting-state
   fMRI, task fMRI, and then TMS hotspot localization. We found significant
   difference of locations between finger tapping fMRI activation and TMS
   hotspot. Specifically, the finger tapping fMRI activation was more
   lateral than the TMS hotspot in the premotor area. The fMRI activation
   peak and TMS hotspot were taken as seeds for resting-state functional
   connectivity analyses. Compared with TMS hotspot, finger tapping fMRI
   activation peak showed more intensive functional connectivity with,
   e.g., the bilateral premotor, insula, putamen, and right globus
   pallidus. The findings more intensive networks of finger tapping
   activation than TMS hotspot suggest that TMS treatment targeting on the
   fMRI activation area might result in more remote effects and would be
   more helpful for TMS treatment on movement disorders.},

Title = {Exploration of Neural Activity under Cognitive Reappraisal Using
   Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Data and Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Background. Neural activity under cognitive reappraisal can be more
   accurately investigated using simultaneous EEG-(electroencephalography)
   fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) than using EEG or fMRI
   only. Complementary spatiotemporal information can be found from
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to study brain function. Method. An effective
   EEG-fMRI fusion framework is proposed in this work. EEG-fMRI data is
   simultaneously sampled on fifteen visually stimulated healthy adult
   participants. Net-station toolbox and empirical mode decomposition are
   employed for EEG denoising. Sparse spectral clustering is used to
   construct fMRI masks that are used to constrain fMRI activated regions.
   A kernel-based canonical correlation analysis is utilized to fuse
   nonlinear EEG-fMRI data. Results. The experimental results show a
   distinct late positive potential (LPP, latency 200-700 ms) from the
   correlated EEG components that are reconstructed from nonlinear EEG-fMRI
   data. Peak value of LPP under reappraisal state is smaller than that
   under negative state, however, larger than that under neutral state. For
   correlated fMRI components, obvious activation can be observed in
   cerebral regions, e.g., the amygdala, temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus,
   hippocampus, and frontal lobe. Meanwhile, in these regions, activated
   intensity under reappraisal state is obviously smaller than that under
   negative state and larger than that under neutral state. Conclusions.
   The proposed EEG-fMRI fusion approach provides an effective way to study
   the neural activities of cognitive reappraisal with high spatiotemporal
   resolution. It is also suitable for other neuroimaging technologies
   using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data.},

Abstract = {Hyperscanning-simultaneous brain scanning of two or more
   individuals-holds great promise in elucidating the neurobiological
   underpinnings of social cognitive functions. This article focuses on
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hyperscanning and
   identifies promising targets for studying the neuroscience of social
   interaction with fMRI hyperscanning. Specifically, we present
   applications of fMRI hyperscanning in the study of social interaction
   along with promising analysis approaches for fMRI hyperscanning, with
   its high spatial and low temporal resolution. We first review fMRI
   hyperscanning studies in social neuroscience and evaluate the premise of
   using this costly neuroimaging paradigm. Many second-person social
   neuroscience studies are possible without fMRI hyperscanning. However,
   certain fundamental aspects of social cognition in real-life social
   interactions, including different roles of interactors, shared intention
   emerging through interaction and history of interaction, can be
   addressed only with hyperscanning. We argue that these fundamental
   aspects have not often been investigated in fMRI hyperscanning studies.
   We then discuss the implication of the signal coupling found in fMRI
   hyperscanning and consider analysis approaches that make fair use of it.
   With fMRI hyperscanning, we can explore not only synchronous brain
   activations but whole-brain asymmetric activation patterns with a lagged
   association between interacting individuals.},

Abstract = {The recent development of multiband functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (MB-fMRI) allows for the reduction of sampling period by
   simultaneously exciting multiple slices-the number of which is referred
   to as the multiband factor. Simultaneously recorded
   electroencephalography (EEG)/MB-fMRI has yet to be validated for data
   quality against conventional single band (SB)-fMRI. Pilot scans were
   conducted on phantoms twice and on a healthy volunteer to ensure no
   heating effects. In the main study, two thermometer probes were attached
   to 16 healthy individuals (ages 20-39, 9 females) whilst they completed
   two sets of 16-min resting-state and two sets of 9-min n-back task
   scans-each set consisting of one MB4 and one SB pulse sequence. No
   heating effects were reported and thermometer data showed mean increases
   of < 1.0 degrees C. Minimal differences between the two scan types were
   found in EEG channel variance and spectra. Expected decreases in
   MB4-fMRI tSNR were observed. In n-back task scans, little to no
   differences were detected in both EEG source analyses and fMRI local
   analyses for mixed effects. Resting-state posterior cingulate cortex
   seed-based analyses of the default mode network along with EEG-informed
   fMRI analysis of the occipital alpha anticorrelation effect showed
   improved statistical and spatial sensitivity at lower scan durations.
   Using EEG/MB4-fMRI for n-back tasks provided no statistical advantages
   nor disadvantages. However, for studying the resting-state, MB4-fMRI
   potentially allows for reduced scanning durations for equivalent
   statistical significance to be obtained or alternatively, larger effect
   sizes for the same scanning duration. As such, simultaneous EEG/MB4-fMRI
   is a viable alternative to EEG/SB-fMRI.},

Abstract = {What are the standards for the reporting methods and results of fMRI
   studies, and how have they evolved over the years? To answer this
   question we reviewed 160 papers published between 2004 and 2019.
   Reporting styles for methods and results of fMRI studies can differ
   greatly between published studies. However, adequate reporting is
   essential for the comprehension, replication and reuse of the study (for
   instance in a meta-analysis). To aid authors in reporting the methods
   and results of their task-based fMRI study the COBIDAS report was
   published in 2016, which provides researchers with clear guidelines on
   how to report the design, acquisition, preprocessing, statistical
   analysis and results (including data sharing) of fMRI studies (Nichols
   et al. in Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing in Neuroimaging
   using fMRI, 2016). In the past reviews have been published that evaluate
   how fMRI methods are reported based on the 2008 guidelines, but they did
   not focus on how task based fMRI results are reported. This review
   updates reporting practices of fMRI methods, and adds an extra focus on
   how fMRI results are reported. We discuss reporting practices about the
   design stage, specific participant characteristics, scanner
   characteristics, data processing methods, data analysis methods and
   reported results.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},

Abstract = {Development of a task-free method for presurgical mapping of language
   function is important for use in young or cognitively impaired patients.
   Resting state connectivity fMRI (RS-fMRI) is a task-free method that may
   be used to identify cognitive networks. We developed a voxelwise RS-fMRI
   metric, Functional Connectivity Hemispheric Contrast (FC-HC), to map the
   language network and determine language laterality through comparison of
   withinhemispheric language network connections (Integration) to
   cross-hemispheric connections (Segregation). For the first time, we
   demonstrated robustness and efficacy of a RS-fMRI metric to map language
   networks across five groups (total N = 243) that differed in MRI
   scanning parameters, fMRI scanning protocols, age, and development
   (typical vs pediatric epilepsy). The resting state FC-HC maps for the
   healthy pediatric and adult groups showed higher values in the left
   hemisphere, and had high agreement with standard task language fMRI; in
   contrast, the epilepsy patient group map was bilateral. FC-HC has strong
   but not perfect agreement with task fMRI and thus, may reflect related
   and complementary information about language plasticity and
   compensation.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Independent component analysis (ICA) is an established method
   of analyzing human functional MRI (fMRI) data. Here, an ICA-based fMRI
   quality control (QC) tool was developed and used.
   Methods: ICA-based fMRI QC tool to be used with a commercial phantom was
   developed. In an attempt to assess the performance of the tool relative
   to preexisting alternative tools, it was used seven weeks before and
   eight weeks after repair of a faulty gradient amplifier of a
   non-state-of-the-art MRI unit. More specifically, its performance was
   compared with the AAPM 100 acceptance testing and quality assurance
   protocol and two fMRI QC protocols, proposed by Freidman et al.

   {[}{''}Automated quality assurance routines for fMRI data applied to a
   multicenter study,{''} Hum. Brain Mapp. 25, 237-246 (2005)],
   respectively.
   Results: The easily developed and applied ICA-based QC protocol provided
   fMRI QC indices and maps equally sensitive to fMRI instabilities with
   the indices and maps of other established protocols. The ICA fMRI QC
   indices were highly correlated with indices of other fMRI QC protocols
   and in some cases theoretically related to them. Three or four
   independent components with slow varying time series are detected under
   normal conditions.
   Conclusions: ICA applied on phantom measurements is an easy and
   efficient tool for fMRI QC. Additionally, it can protect against
   misinterpretations of artifact components as human brain activations.
   Evaluating fMRI QC indices in the central region of a phantom is not
   always the optimal choice. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {Background
   MR Tractography enables non-invasive preoperative depiction of language
   subcortical tracts, which is crucial for the presurgical work-up of
   brain tumors; however, it cannot evaluate the exact function of the
   fibers.
   Purpose
   A systematic pipeline was developed to combine tractography
   reconstruction of language fiber bundles, based on anatomical landmarks
   (Anatomical-T), with language fMRI cortical activations. A fMRI-targeted
   Tractography (fMRI-T) was thus obtained, depicting the subsets of the
   anatomical tracts whose endpoints are located inside a fMRI activation.
   We hypothesized that fMRI-T could provide additional functional
   information regarding the subcortical structures, better reflecting the
   eloquent white matter structures identified intraoperatively.
   Methods
   Both Anatomical-T and fMRI-T of language fiber tracts were performed on
   16 controls and preoperatively on 16 patients with left-hemisphere brain
   tumors, using a q-ball residual bootstrap algorithm based on High
   Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) datasets (b = 3000 s/mm(2);
   60 directions); fMRI ROIs were obtained using picture naming, verbal
   fluency, and auditory verb generation tasks. In healthy controls,
   normalized MNI atlases of fMRI-T and Anatomical-T were obtained. In
   patients, the surgical resection of the tumor was pursued by identifying
   eloquent structures with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation
   mapping and extending surgery to the functional boundaries.
   Post-surgical MRI allowed to identify Anatomical-T and fMRI-T
   non-eloquent portions removed during the procedure.
   Results
   MNI Atlases showed that fMRI-T is a subset of Anatomical-T, and that
   different task-specific fMRI-T involve both shared subsets and
   task-specific subsets - e.g., verbal fluency fMRI-T strongly involves
   dorsal frontal tracts, consistently with the phonogical-articulatory
   features of this task. A quantitative analysis in patients revealed that
   Anatomical-T removed portions of AF-SLF and IFOF were significantly
   greater than verbal fluency fMRI-T ones, suggesting that fMRI-T is a
   more specific approach. In addition, qualitative analyses showed that
   fMRI-T AF-SLF and IFOF predict the exact functional limits of resection
   with increased specificity when compared to Anatomical-T counterparts,
   especially the superior frontal portion of IFOF, in a subcohort of
   patients.
   Conclusion
   These results suggest that performing fMRI-T in addition to the
   `classic' Anatomical-T may be useful in a preoperative setting to
   identify the `high-risk subsets' that should be spared during the
   surgical procedure.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Epilepsy affects neural processing and often causes infra- or
   interhemispheric language reorganization, rendering localization solely
   based on anatomical landmarks (e.g., Broca's area) unreliable.
   Preoperative brain mapping is necessary to weigh the risk of resection
   with the risk of postoperative deficit. However, the use of conventional
   mapping methods (e.g., somatosensory stimulation, task-based functional
   MRI {[}fMRI]) in pediatric patients is technically difficult due to low
   compliance and their unique neurophysiology. Resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI), a ``task-free{''} technique based on the neural activity of
   the brain at rest, has the potential to overcome these limitations. The
   authors hypothesized that language networks can be identified from
   rs-fMRI by applying functional connectivity analyses.
   METHODS Cases in which both task-based fMRI and rs-fMRI were acquired as
   part of the preoperative clinical protocol for epilepsy surgery were
   reviewed. Task-based fMRI consisted of 2 language tasks and 1 motor
   task. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired while the patients watched
   an animated movie and were analyzed using independent component analysis
   (i.e., data-driven method). The authors extracted language networks from
   rs-fMRI data by performing a similarity analysis with functionally
   defined language network templates via a template-matching procedure.
   The Dice coefficient was used to quantify the overlap.
   RESULTS Thirteen children underwent conventional task-based fMRI (e.g.,
   verb generation, object naming), rs-fMRI, and structural imaging at
   1.5T. The language components with the highest overlap with the language
   templates were identified for each patient. Language lateralization
   results from task-based fMRI and rs-fMRI mapping were comparable, with
   good concordance in most cases. Resting-state fMRI-derived language maps
   indicated that language was on the left in 4 patients (31\%), on the
   right in 5 patients (38\%), and bilateral in 4 patients (31\%). In some
   cases, rs-fMRI indicated a more extensive language representation.
   CONCLUSIONS Resting-state fMRI-derived language network data were
   identified at the patient level using a template-matching method. More
   than half of the patients in this study presented with atypical language
   lateralization, emphasizing the need for mapping. Overall, these data
   suggest that this technique may be used to preoperatively identify
   language networks in pediatric patients. It may also optimize
   presurgical planning of electrode placement and thereby guide the
   surgeon's approach to the epileptogenic zone.},

Title = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging versus task-based
   activity for language mapping and correlation with perioperative

Journal = {BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Introduction Preoperative language mapping using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) aims to identify eloquent areas in the vicinity
   of surgically resectable brain lesions. fMRI methodology relies on the
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) analysis to identify brain language
   areas. Task-based fMRI studies the BOLD signal increase in brain areas
   during a language task to identify brain language areas, which requires
   patients' cooperation, whereas resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) allows
   identification of functional networks without performing any explicit
   task through the analysis of the synchronicity of spontaneous BOLD
   signal oscillation between brain areas. The aim of this study was to
   compare preoperative language mapping using rsfMRI and task fMRI to
   cortical mapping (CM) during awake craniotomies. Methods Fifty adult
   patients surgically treated for a brain lesion were enrolled. All
   patients had a presurgical language mapping with both task fMRI and
   rsfMRI. Identified language networks were compared to perioperative
   language mapping using electric cortical stimulation. Results
   Resting-state fMRI was able to detect brain language areas during CM
   with a sensitivity of 100\% compared to 65.6\% with task fMRI. However,
   we were not able to perform a specificity analysis and compare
   task-based and rest fMRI with our perioperative setting in the current
   study. In second-order analysis, task fMRI imaging included main nodes
   of the SN and main areas involved in semantics were identified in
   rsfMRI. Conclusion Resting-state fMRI for presurgical language mapping
   is easy to implement, allowing the identification of functional brain
   language network with a greater sensitivity than task-based fMRI, at the
   cost of some precautions and a lower specificity. Further study is
   required to compare both the sensitivity and the specificity of the two
   methods and to evaluate the clinical value of rsfMRI as an alternative
   tool for the presurgical identification of brain language areas.},

Abstract = {Brain network alterations have been studied extensively in patients with
   mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and other focal epilepsies using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However,
   little has been done to characterize the basic fMRI signal alterations
   caused by focal epilepsy. Here, we characterize how mTLE affects the
   fMRI signal in epileptic foci and networks. Resting-state fMRI and
   diffusion MRI were collected from 47 unilateral mTLE patients and 96
   healthy controls. FMRI activity, quantified by amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations, was increased in the epileptic focus and
   connected regions in mTLE. Evidence for spread of this epileptic fMRI
   activity was found through linear relationships of regional activity
   across subjects, the association of these relationships with functional
   connectivity, and increased activity along white matter tracts. These
   fMRI activity increases were found to be dependent on the epileptic
   focus, where the activity was related to disease severity, suggesting
   the focus to be the origin of these pathological alterations.
   Furthermore, we found fMRI activity decreases in the default mode
   network of right mTLE patients with different properties than the
   activity increases found in the epileptic focus. This work provides
   insights into basic fMRI signal alterations and their potential spread
   across networks in focal epilepsy.},

Abstract = {Task-evoked Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD-fMRI) signal
   activation is widely used to interrogate eloquence of brain areas.
   However, data interpretation can be improved, especially in regions with
   absent BOLD-fMRI signal activation. Absent BOLD-fMRI signal activation
   may actually represent false-negative activation due to impaired
   cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) of the vascular bed. The
   relationship between impaired BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI signal activation
   may be better studied in healthy subjects where neurovascular coupling
   is known to be intact. Using a model-based prospective end-tidal carbon
   dioxide (CO2) targeting algorithm, we performed two controlled 3 tesla
   BOLD-CVR studies on 17 healthy subjects: 1: at the subjects' individual
   resting end-tidal CO2 baseline. 2: Around +6.0 mmHg CO2 above the
   subjects' individual resting baseline. Two BOLD-fMRI finger-tapping
   experiments were performed at similar normo- and hypercapnic levels.
   Relative BOLD fMRI signal activation and t-values were calculated for
   BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI data. For each component of the cerebral
   motor-network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor
   area, cerebellum and Pronto-operculum), the correlation between BOLD-CVR
   and BOLD-fMRI signal changes and t-values was investigated. Finally, a
   voxelwise quantitative analysis of the impact of BOLD-CVR on BOLD-fMRI
   was performed. For the motor-network, the linear correlation coefficient
   between BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI t-values were significant (p<0.01) and in
   the range 0.33-0.55, similar to the correlations between the CVR and
   fMRI Delta\%signal (p<0.05; range 0.34-0.60). The linear relationship
   between CVR and fMRI is challenged by our voxel-wise analysis of
   Delta\%signal and t-value change between normo- and hypercapnia. Our
   main finding is that BOLD fMRI signal activation maps are markedly
   dampened in the presence of impaired BOLD-CVR and highlights the
   importance of a complementary BOLD-CVR assessment in addition to a
   task-evoked BOLD fMRI to identify brain areas at risk for false-negative
   BOLD-fMRI signal activation.},

Abstract = {Purpose Resting-state functional MRI (rs-FMRI) has shown potential for
   presurgical mapping of eloquent cortex when a patient's performance on
   task-based FMRI is compromised. The seed-based analysis is a practical
   approach for detecting rs-FMRI functional networks; however, seed
   localization remains challenging for presurgical language mapping.
   Therefore, we proposed a data-driven approach to guide seed localization
   for presurgical rs-FMRI language mapping. Methods Twenty-six patients
   with brain tumors located in left perisylvian regions had undergone
   task-based FMRI and rs-FMRI before tumor resection. For the seed-based
   rs-FMRI language mapping, a seeding approach that integrates regional
   homogeneity and meta-analysis maps (RH+MA) was proposed to guide the
   seed localization. Canonical and task-based seeding approaches were used
   for comparison. The performance of the 3 seeding approaches was
   evaluated by calculating the Dice coefficients between each rs-FMRI
   language mapping result and the result from task-based FMRI. Results
   With the RH+MA approach, selecting among the top 6 seed candidates
   resulted in the highest Dice coefficient for 81\% of patients (21 of 26)
   and the top 9 seed candidates for 92\% of patients (24 of 26). The RH+MA
   approach yielded rs-FMRI language mapping results that were in greater
   agreement with the results of task-based FMRI, with significantly higher
   Dice coefficients (P < .05) than that of canonical and task-based
   approaches within putative language regions. Conclusion The proposed
   RH+MA approach outperformed the canonical and task-based seed
   localization for rs-FMRI language mapping. The results suggest that
   RH+MA is a robust and feasible method for seed-based functional
   connectivity mapping in clinical practice.},

Journal = {CEREBRAL CORTEX},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies have revealed specific
   low-frequency hemodynamic signal fluctuations (<0.1 Hz) in the brain,
   which could be related to neuronal oscillations through the
   neurovascular coupling mechanism. Given the vascular origin of the fMRI
   signal, it remains challenging to separate the neural correlates of
   global rs-fMRI signal fluctuations from other confounding sources.
   However, the slow-oscillation detected from individual vessels by
   single-vessel fMRI presents strong correlation to neural oscillations.
   Here, we use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the future
   temporal evolution of the rs-fMRI slow oscillation from both rodent and
   human brains. The RNNs trained with vessel-specific rs-fMRI signals
   encode the unique brain oscillatory dynamic feature, presenting more
   effective prediction than the conventional autoregressive model. This
   RNN-based predictive modeling of rs-fMRI datasets from the Human
   Connectome Project (HCP) reveals brain state-specific characteristics,
   demonstrating an inverse relationship between the global rs-fMRI signal
   fluctuation with the internal default-mode network (DMN) correlation.
   The RNN prediction method presents a unique data-driven encoding scheme
   to specify potential brain state differences based on the global fMRI
   signal fluctuation, but not solely dependent on the global variance.},

Abstract = {Laboratory animal research has provided significant knowledge into the
   function of cortical circuits at the laminar level, which has yet to be
   fully leveraged towards insights about human brain function on a similar
   spatiotemporal scale. The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in conjunction with neural models provides new opportunities to
   gain important insights from current knowledge. During the last five
   years, human studies have demonstrated the value of high-resolution fMRI
   to study laminar-specific activity in the human brain. This is mostly
   performed at ultra-high-field strengths (>= 7 T) and is known as laminar
   fMRI. Advancements in laminar fMRI are beginning to open new
   possibilities for studying questions in basic cognitive neuroscience. In
   this paper, we first review recent methodological advances in laminar
   fMRI and describe recent human laminar fMRI studies. Then, we discuss
   how the use of laminar fMRI can help bridge the gap between cortical
   circuit models and human cognition.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has greatly advanced our
   understanding of cerebral functional changes occurring in patients with
   multiple sclerosis (MS). However, most of our knowledge regarding brain
   plasticity and repair in MS as evidenced by fMRI has been extrapolated
   from cross-sectional studies across different phenotypes of the disease.
   This topical review provides an overview of this research, but also
   highlights limitations of existing fMRI studies with cross-sectional
   design. We then review the few existing longitudinal fMRI studies and
   discuss the feasibility and constraints of serial fMRI in individuals
   with MS. We further emphasize the potential to track fMRI changes in
   evolving disease and the insights this may give in terms of mechanisms
   of adaptation and repair, focusing on serial fMRI to monitor response to
   disease-modifying therapies or rehabilitation interventions. Finally, we
   offer recommendations for designing future research studies to overcome
   previous methodological shortcomings.},

Title = {Improvement of sensitivity and specificity for laminar BOLD fMRI with
   double spin-echo EPI in humans at 7 T},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {241},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Mapping mesoscopic cortical functional units such as columns or laminae
   is increasingly pursued by ultra-high field (UHF) functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). The most popular approach for high-resolution
   fMRI is currently gradient-echo (GE) blood oxygenation level-dependent
   (BOLD) fMRI. However, its spatial accuracy is reduced due to its
   sensitivity to draining vessels, including pial veins, whereas spin-echo
   (SE) BOLD signal is expected to have higher spatial accuracy, albeit
   with lower sensitivity than the GE-BOLD signal. Here, we introduce a new
   double spin-echo (dSE) echo-planar imaging (EPI) method to improve the
   sensitivity of SE-BOLD contrast by averaging two spin-echoes using three
   radiofrequency pulses. Human fMRI experiments were performed with slices
   perpendicular to the central sulcus between motor and sensory cortices
   at 7 T during fist-clenching with touching. First, we evaluated the
   feasibility of single-shot dSE-EPI for BOLD fMRI with 1.5 mm isotropic
   resolution and found that dSE-BOLD fMRI has higher signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR), temporal SNR (tSNR), and higher functional sensitivity than
   conventional SE-BOLD fMRI. Second, to investigate the laminar
   specificity of dSE-BOLD fMRI, we implemented a multi-shot approach to
   achieve 0.8-mm isotropic resolution with sliding-window reconstruction.
   Unlike GE-BOLD fMRI, the cortical profile of dSE-BOLD fMRI peaked at
   similar to 1.0 mm from the surface of the primary motor and sensory
   cortices, demonstrating an improvement of laminar specificity in humans
   over GE-BOLD fMRI. The proposed multi-shot dSE-EPI method is viable for
   high spatial resolution UHF-fMRI studies in the pursuit of resolving
   mesoscopic functional units.},

Title = {EEG and fMRI coupling and decoupling based on joint independent
   component analysis (jICA)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {369},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Background: Meaningful integration of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) requires knowing whether
   these measurements reflect the activity of the same neural sources,
   i.e., estimating the degree of coupling and decoupling between the
   neuroimaging modalities. New method: This paper proposes a method to
   quantify the coupling and decoupling of fMRI and EEG signals based on
   the mixing matrix produced by joint independent component analysis
   (jICA). The method is termed fMRI/EEG-jICA. Results: fMRI and EEG
   acquired during a syllable detection task with variable syllable
   presentation rates (0.25-3 Hz) were separated with jICA into two
   spatiotemporally distinct components, a primary component that increased
   nonlinearly in amplitude with syllable presentation rate, putatively
   reflecting an obligatory auditory response, and a secondary component
   that declined nonlinearly with syllable presentation rate, putatively
   reflecting an auditory attention orienting response. The two EEG
   subcomponents were of similar amplitude, but the secondary fMRI
   subcomponent was ten folds smaller than the primary one. Comparison to
   existing method: FMRI multiple regression analysis yielded a map more
   consistent with the primary than secondary fMRI subcomponent of jICA, as
   determined by a greater area under the curve (0.5 versus 0.38) in a
   sensitivity and specificity analysis of spatial overlap. Conclusion:
   fMRI/EEG-jICA revealed spatiotemporally distinct brain networks with
   greater sensitivity than fMRI multiple regression analysis,
   demonstrating how this method can be used for leveraging EEG signals to
   inform the detection and functional characterization of fMRI signals.
   fMRI/EEG-jICA may be useful for studying neurovascular coupling at a
   macro-level, e.g., in neurovascular disorders.},

Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate basic task-functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)
   results on Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and Wistar rats under three
   anesthetic regimens.Introduction: SD rats and Wistar rats are the
   two-most commonly used rat strains in medical research and neuroimaging
   studies. It still lacks a direct comparison of basic task-fMRI and
   rs-fMRI results between the Wistar rats and SD rats under different
   anesthetic regimens.Methods: Two rat strains and different time points
   were adopted to investigate task-fMRI activation and rs-fMRI functional
   connectivity (FC) results under three kinds of anesthetic regimens
   (2-2.5\% isoflurane only, dexmedetomidine bolus combined with a
   continuous infusion, and dexmedetomidine bolus combined with 0.3-0.5\%
   isoflurane). The electrical forepaw stimulation method and seed-based FC
   results were used to compare the task-fMRI brain activation and rs-fMRI
   FC patterns between the two rat strains.Results: The results showed that
   Wistar rats had more robust brain activation in task fMRI experiments
   while exhibiting a less specific interhemispheric FC than that of SD
   rats under the two dexmedetomidine anesthetic regimens. Moreover, even
   low-level isoflurane could significantly affect task-fMRI and rs-fMRI
   results in both rat strains.Conclusions: SD and Wistar rats showed
   different brain activations and interhemispheric FC patterns under the
   two dexmedetomidine anesthetic regimens. These results may serve as
   reference information for small-animal fMRI studies. Impact statementOur
   study demonstrates different stimulation-induced blood oxygen
   level-dependent responses and functional connectivity patterns between
   Sprague Dawley rats and Wistar rats under three anesthetics. This study
   provides some reference results for different anesthetics' effects on
   different rat strains in different functional magnetic resonance imaging
   modalities.},

Title = {Physiological effects of a habituation procedure for functional MRI in
   awake mice using a cryogenic radiofrequency probe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {274},
Pages = {38-48},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mice is
   typically performed under anesthesia due to difficulties in holding the
   head of awake mice stably with a conventional three-point fixation
   method that uses a tooth-bar and earplugs. Although some studies have
   succeeded in fMRI in awake mice by attaching a head-post on the skull,
   this cannot be applied to fMRI using a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   cryogenic MRI-detector, CryoProbe, because it covers the head of a mouse
   closely.
   New method: We developed head-fixation implements for awake mice that
   are applicable to fMRI using CryoProbe.
   Results: A head-bar was surgically attached to the skull of a mouse that
   was then habituated to a mock fMRI-environment, two hours/day for eight
   days with physiological examinations of body-weight, fecal weight,
   electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram. EMG power decreased with
   just one day of habituation, whereas heart rate decreased after at least
   seven days of habituation. Estimated head motions of awake mice during
   fMRI were significantly smaller than a voxel size. Unexpectedly,
   temporal SNR of fMRI signals for awake mice was higher than that for
   anesthetized mice held by a conventional method. Functional connectivity
   in the brain of both anesthetized and awake mice showed bilateral and
   unilateral networks.
   Comparison with existing method(s):fMRI using CryoProbe had been
   performed on anesthetized mice previously. Our method does not use
   anesthetics during habituation or fMRI.
   Conclusion: Our method would be beneficial for translational research
   using fMRI in mice and humans because human fMRI is typically performed
   without anesthetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   introduction of multiband (MB) protocols and in-plane acceleration,
   allow for increased scanning speed and improved temporal resolution.
   However, they may also lead to reduced temporal signal to noise ratio
   and increased signal leakage between simultaneously excited slices.
   These methods have been adopted in several scanning modalities including
   diffusion weighted imaging and fMRI. To our knowledge, no study has
   formally compared the reliability of the same resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) metrics (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations;
   seed-to-voxel and region of interest {[}ROI]-to-ROI connectivity) across
   conventional single-band fMRI and different MB acquisitions, with and
   without in-plane acceleration, across three sessions. In this study, 24
   healthy older adults were scanned over three visits, on weeks 0, 1, and
   4, and, on each occasion, underwent a conventional single band rs-fMRI
   scan and three different rs-fMRI scans with MB factors 4 and 6, with and
   without in-plane acceleration. Across all three rs-fMRI metrics, the
   reliability scores were highest with MB factor 4 with no in-plane
   acceleration for cortical areas and with conventional single band for
   subcortical areas. Recommendations for future research studies are
   discussed.},

Title = {Investigation of True High Frequency Electrical Substrates of fMRI-Based
   Resting State Networks Using Parallel Independent Component Analysis of
   Simultaneous EEG/fMRI Data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Previous work using simultaneously acquired electroencephalography (BEG)
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has shown that the
   slow temporal dynamics of resting state brain networks (RSNs), e.g.,
   default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), obtained from fMRI are
   correlated with smoothed and down sampled versions of various EEG
   features such as microstates and band-limited power envelopes.
   Therefore, even though the down sampled and smoothed envelope of EEG
   gamma band power is correlated with fMRI fluctuations in the RSNs, it
   does not mean that the electrical substrates of the RSNs fluctuate with
   periods <100 ms. Based on the scale free properties of EEG microstates
   and their correlation with resting state fMRI fluctuations in the RSNs,
   researchers have speculated that truly high frequency electrical
   substrates may exist for the RSNs, which would make resting fluctuations
   obtained from fMRI more meaningful to typically occurring fast neuronal
   processes in the sub -100 ms time scale. In this study, we test this
   critical hypothesis using an integrated framework involving simultaneous
   EEG/fMRI acquisition, fast fMRI sampling (TR = 200 ms) using multiband
   EPI (MB EPI), and EEG/fMRI fusion using parallel independent component
   analysis (pICA) which does not require the down sampling of EEG to fMRI
   temporal resolution. Our results demonstrate that with faster sampling,
   high frequency electrical substrates (fluctuating with periods < 100 ms
   time scale) of the RSNs can be observed. This provides a sounder
   neurophysiological basis for the RSNs.},

Title = {Prediction of Fuhrman grade of renal clear cell carcinoma by multimodal

Abstract = {AIM: To explore the value of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   radiomics combined with traditional radiologist-defined semantic
   characteristics and conventional (cMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI)
   texture features in predicting Fuhrman grade of clear cell renal cell
   carcinoma (ccRCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 89 patients with
   histopathologically proven ccRCC (low-grade, 54; high-grade, 35) were
   collected. Texture features were extracted from cMRI (T1-and T2-weighted
   imaging) and fMRI (Dixon-MRI; blood-oxygen-level dependent {[}BOLD]-MRI;
   and susceptibility-weighted imaging {[}SWI]) images, and the traditional
   characteristics (TC) were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was
   performed to develop models based on TC, cMRI, and fMRI texture features
   for grading. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and
   leave-group-out cross-validation (LGOCV) were performed to test the
   reliability of combined models. RESULTS: Two T2-weighted imaging-based,
   two Dixon\_W-based, one Dixon\_F-based, one BOLD-based, and three
   SWI-based texture features, and three TC were extracted for feature
   selection. TC, cMRI, fMRI, cMRI+fMRI, cMRI+TC, fMRI+TC, and cMRI+fMRI+TC
   models were constructed. The AUC of the cMRI+fMRI+TC model for
   differentiating high-from low-grade ccRCC was 0.74, with 81.42\%
   accuracy, 75.93\% sensitivity, and 91.43\% specificity. The fMRI+TC
   model exhibited a performance similar to that of the cMRI+fMRI+TC model
   (p>0.05). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the fMRI+TC and
   cMRI+fMRI+TC models were significantly higher than those of the other
   five models (all p<0.05). For the cMRI+fMRI+TC model, the mean accuracy
   was 85.40\% after 100 LGOCV for the test sets. CONCLUSION: Multimodal
   MRI radiomics combined with TC, cMRI, and fMRI texture features may be a
   reliable quantitative approach for differentiating high-grade ccRCC from
   low-grade ccRCC. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The

Abstract = {Objective: Surgical treatment in epilepsy is effective if the
   epileptogenic zone (EZ) can be correctly localized and characterized.
   Here we use simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data to derive EEG-fMRI and electrical
   source imaging (ESI) maps. Their yield and their individual and combined
   ability to (1) localize the EZ and (2) predict seizure outcome were then
   evaluated.
   Methods: Fifty-three children with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent
   EEG-fMRI. Interictal discharges were mapped using both EEG-fMRI
   hemodynamic responses and ESI. A single localization was derived from
   each individual test (EEG-fMRI global maxima {[}GM]/ESI maximum) and
   from the combination of both maps (EEG-fMRI/ESI spatial intersection).
   To determine the localization accuracy and its predictive performance,
   the individual and combined test localizations were compared to the
   presumed EZ and to the postsurgical outcome.
   Results: Fifty-two of 53 patients had significant maps: 47 of 53 for
   EEG-fMRI, 44 of 53 for ESI, and 34 of 53 for both. The EZ was well
   characterized in 29 patients; 26 had an EEG-fMRI GM localization that
   was correct in 11, 22 patients had ESI localization that was correct in
   17, and 12 patients had combined EEG-fMRI and ESI that was correct in
   11. Seizure outcome following resection was correctly predicted by
   EEG-fMRI GM in 8 of 20 patients, and by the ESI maximum in 13 of 16. The
   combined EEG-fMRI/ESI region entirely predicted outcome in 9 of 9
   patients, including 3 with no lesion visible on MRI.
   Interpretation: EEG-fMRI combined with ESI provides a simple unbiased
   localization that may predict surgery better than each individual test,
   including in MRI-negative patients.},

Abstract = {Resting-state (rs) fMRI has been shown to be useful for preoperative
   mapping of functional areas in patients with brain tumors and epilepsy.
   However, its lack of standardization limits its widespread use and
   hinders multicenter collaboration. The American Society of Functional
   Neuroradiology, American Society of Pediatric Neuroradiology, and the
   American Society of Neuroradiology Functional and Diffusion MR Imaging
   Study Group recommend specific rs-fMRI acquisition approaches and
   preprocessing steps that will further support rs-fMRI for future
   clinical use. A task force with expertise in fMRI from multiple
   institutions provided recommendations on the rs-fMRI steps needed for
   mapping of language, motor, and visual areas in adult and pediatric
   patients with brain tumor and epilepsy. These were based on an extensive
   literature review and expert consensus. Following rs-fMRI acquisition
   parameters are recommended: minimum 6-minute acquisition time; scan with
   eyes open with fixation; obtain rs-fMRI before both task-based fMRI and
   contrast administration; temporal resolution of <= 2 seconds; scanner
   field strength of 3T or higher. The following rs-fMRI preprocessing
   steps and parameters are recommended: motion correction (seed-based
   correlation analysis {[}SBC], independent component analysis {[}ICA]);
   despiking (SBC); volume censoring (SBC, ICA); nuisance regression of CSF
   and white matter signals (SBC); head motion regression (SBC, ICA);
   bandpass filtering (SBC, ICA); and spatial smoothing with a kernel size
   that is twice the effective voxel size (SBC, ICA).The consensus
   recommendations put forth for rs-fMRI acquisition and preprocessing
   steps will aid in standardization of practice and guide rs-fMRI program
   development across institutions. Standardized rs-fMRI protocols and
   processing pipelines are essential for multicenter trials and to
   implement rs-fMRI as part of standard clinical practice.},

Abstract = {Structural MRI (sMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) have
   provided promising results in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   though the utility of integrating sMRI with rs-fMRI has not been
   explored thoroughly. We investigated the performances of rs-fMRI and
   sMRI in single modality and multi-modality approaches for classifying
   patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress to probable
   AD-MCI converter (MCI-C) from those with MCI who do not progress to
   probable AD-MCI non-converter (MCI-NC). The cortical and subcortical
   measurements, e.g. cortical thickness, extracted from sMRI and graph
   measures extracted from rs-fMRI functional connectivity were used as
   features in our algorithm. We trained and tested a support vector
   machine to classify MCI-C from MCI-NC using rs-fMRI and sMRI features.
   Our algorithm for classifying MCI-C and MCI-NC utilized a small number
   of optimal features and achieved accuracies of 89\% for sMRI, 93\% for
   rs-fMRI, and 97\% for the combination of sMRI with rs-fMRI. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study that investigated integration of
   rs-fMRI and sMRI for identification of the early stage of AD. Our
   findings shed light on integration of sMRI with rs-fMRI for
   identification of the early stages of AD.},

Title = {Automatic EEG-assisted retrospective motion correction for fMRI
   (aE-REMCOR)},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {133-147},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Head motions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) impair
   fMRI data quality and introduce systematic artifacts that can affect
   interpretation of fMRI results. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings
   performed simultaneously with fMRI provide high-temporal-resolution
   information about ongoing brain activity as well as head movements.
   Recently, an EEG-assisted retrospective motion correction (E-REMCOR)
   method was introduced. E-REMCOR utilizes EEG motion artifacts to correct
   the effects of head movements in simultaneously acquired fMRI data on a
   slice-by-slice basis. While E-REMCOR is an efficient motion correction
   approach, it involves an independent component analysis (ICA) of the EEG
   data and identification of motion-related ICs. Here we report an
   automated implementation of E-REMCOR, referred to as aE-REMCOR, which we
   developed to facilitate the application of E-REMCOR in large-scale
   EEG-fMRI studies. The aE-REMCOR algorithm, implemented in MATLAB,
   enables an automated preprocessing of the EEG data, an ICA
   decomposition, and, importantly, an automatic identification of
   motion-related ICs. aE-REMCOR has been used to perform retrospective
   motion correction for 305 fMRI datasets from 16 subjects, who
   participated in EEG-fMRI experiments conducted on a 3 TMRI scanner.
   Performance of aE-REMCOR has been evaluated based on improvement in
   temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of the fMRI data, as well as
   correction efficiency defined in terms of spike reduction in fMRI motion
   parameters. The results show that aE-REMCOR is capable of substantially
   reducing head motion artifacts in fMRI data. In particular, when there
   are significant rapid head movements during the scan, a large TSNR
   improvement and high correction efficiency can be achieved. Depending on
   a subject's motion, an average TSNR improvement over the brain upon the
   application of aE-REMCOR can be as high as 27\%, with top ten percent of
   the TSNR improvement values exceeding 55\%. The average correction
   efficiency over the 305 fMRI scans is 18\% and the largest achieved
   efficiency is 71\%. The utility of aE-REMCOR on the resting state fMRI
   connectivity of the default mode network is also examined. The
   motion-induced position-dependent error in the DMN connectivity analysis
   is shown to be reduced when aE-REMCOR is utilized. These results
   demonstrate that aE-REMCOR can be conveniently and efficiently used to
   improve fMRI motion correction in large clinical EEG-fMRI studies. (C)

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown elevations in the
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with, but

   elevations, assessing rhythmic oscillations in the BOLD signal with fMRI
   may improve the accuracy of seizure mapping. We report a case of a
   patient with non-convulsive, right hemispheric seizures who underwent
   fMRI. Unbiased processing methods revealed a map of rhythmically
   oscillating BOLD signal over the cortical region affected by seizure,
   and synchronous BOLD signal in the contralateral cerebellum.
   High-resolution fMRI may help identify the spatial topography of seizure
   and provide insights into seizure physiology.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Objective. Concurrent electroencephalography and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) signals can be used to uncover the nature
   of brain activities during sleep. However, analyzing simultaneously
   acquired EEG-fMRI data is extremely time consuming and experience
   dependent. Thus, we developed a pipeline, which we named A-PASS, to
   automatically analyze simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data for studying
   brain activities during sleep. Approach. A deep learning model was
   trained on a sleep EEG-fMRI dataset from 45 subjects and used to perform
   sleep stage scoring. Various fMRI indices can be calculated with A-PASS
   to depict the neurophysiological characteristics across different sleep
   stages. We tested the performance of A-PASS on an independent sleep
   EEG-fMRI dataset from 28 subjects. Statistical maps regarding the main
   effect of sleep stages and differences between each pair of stages of
   fMRI indices were generated and compared using both A-PASS and manual
   processing methods. Main results. The deep learning model implemented in
   A-PASS achieved both an accuracy and F1-score higher than 70\% for sleep
   stage classification on EEG data acquired during fMRI scanning. The
   statistical maps generated from A-PASS largely resembled those produced
   from manually scored stages plus a combination of multiple software
   programs. Significance. A-PASS allowed efficient EEG-fMRI data
   processing without manual operation and could serve as a reliable and
   powerful tool for simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies on sleep.},

Title = {The Role of Cerebrovascular-Reactivity Mapping in Functional MRI:
   Calibrated fMRI and Resting-State fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Task and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is primarily based on the
   same blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) phenomenon that MRI-based
   cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) mapping has most commonly relied upon.
   This technique is finding an ever-increasing role in neuroscience and
   clinical research as well as treatment planning. The estimation of CVR
   has unique applications in and associations with fMRI. In particular,
   CVR estimation is part of a family of techniques called calibrated BOLD
   fMRI, the purpose of which is to allow the mapping of cerebral oxidative
   metabolism (CMRO2) using a combination of BOLD and cerebral-blood flow
   (CBF) measurements. Moreover, CVR has recently been shown to be a major
   source of vascular bias in computing resting-state functional
   connectivity, in much the same way that it is used to neutralize the
   vascular contribution in calibrated fMRI. Furthermore, due to the
   obvious challenges in estimating CVR using gas challenges, a rapidly
   growing field of study is the estimation of CVR without any form of
   challenge, including the use of resting-state fMRI for that purpose.
   This review addresses all of these aspects in which CVR interacts with
   fMRI and the role of CVR in calibrated fMRI, provides an overview of the
   physiological biases and assumptions underlying hypercapnia-based CVR
   and calibrated fMRI, and provides a view into the future of non-invasive
   CVR measurement.},

Abstract = {Purpose Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has an established
   role in neurosurgical planning; however, ambiguity surrounds the
   comparative value of resting and task-based fMRI relative to anatomical
   localization of the sensorimotor cortex. This study was carried out to
   determine: 1) how often fMRI adds to prediction of motor risks beyond
   expert neuroradiological review, 2) success rates of presurgical resting
   and task-based sensorimotor mapping, and 3) the impact of accelerated
   resting fMRI acquisitions on network detectability.
   Methods Data were collected at 2 centers from 71 patients with a primary
   brain tumor (31 women; mean age 41.9 +/- 13.9 years) and 14 healthy
   individuals (6 women; mean age 37.9 +/- 12.7 years). Preoperative 3T MRI
   included anatomical scans and resting fMRI using unaccelerated (TR=3.5
   s), intermediate (TR=1.56 s) or high temporal resolution (TR=0.72 s)
   sequences. Task fMRI finger tapping data were acquired in 45 patients.
   Group differences in fMRI reproducibility, spatial overlap and success
   frequencies were assessed with t-tests and chi(2)-tests.
   Results Radiological review identified the central sulcus in 98.6\%
   (70/71) patients. Task-fMRI succeeded in 100\% (45/45). Resting fMRI
   failed to identify a sensorimotor network in up to 10 patients; it
   succeeded in 97.9\% (47/48) of accelerated fMRIs, compared to only
   60.9\% (14/23) of unaccelerated fMRIs ( chi (2) = 17.84, p < 0.001). Of
   the patients 12 experienced postoperative deterioration, largely
   predicted by anatomical proximity to the central sulcus.
   Conclusion The use of fMRI in patients with residual or intact
   presurgical motor function added value to uncertain anatomical
   localization in just a single peri-Rolandic glioma case. Resting fMRI
   showed high correspondence to task localization when acquired with
   accelerated sequences but offered limited success at standard
   acquisitions.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography
   (ECoG) research have been influential in revealing the functional
   characteristics of category-selective responses in human ventral
   temporal cortex (VTC). One important, but unanswered, question is how
   these two types of measurements might be related with respect to the
   VTC. Here we examined which components of the ECoG signal correspond to
   the fMRI response by using a rare opportunity to measure both fMRI and
   ECoG responses from the same individuals to images of exemplars of
   various categories including faces, limbs, cars and houses. Our data
   reveal three key findings. First, we discovered that the coupling
   between fMRI and ECoG responses is frequency and time dependent. The
   strongest and most sustained correlation is observed between fMRI and
   high frequency broadband (HFB) ECoG responses (30-160 hz). In contrast,
   the correlation between fMRI and ECoG signals in lower frequency bands
   is temporally transient, where the correlation is initially positive,
   but then tapers off or becomes negative. Second, we find that the strong
   and positive correlation between fMRI and ECoG signals in all frequency
   bands emerges rapidly around 100 ms after stimulus onset, together with
   the onset of the first stimulus-driven neural signals in VTC. Third, we
   find that the spatial topology and representational structure of
   category-selectivity in VTC reflected in ECoG HFB responses mirrors the
   topology and structure observed with fMRI. These findings of a strong
   and rapid coupling between fMRI and HFB responses validate fMRI
   measurements of functional selectivity with recordings of direct neural
   activity and suggest that fMRI category-selective signals in VTC are
   associated with feed-forward neural processing. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   for Reduction of Big Data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},

Abstract = {The exponential growth of fMRI big data offers researchers an
   unprecedented opportunity to explore functional brain networks. However,
   this opportunity has not been fully explored yet due to the lack of
   effective and efficient tools for handling such fMRI big data. One major
   challenge is that computing capabilities still lag behind the growth of
   large-scale fMRI databases, e.g., it takes many days to perform
   dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole-brain fMRI data for an
   fMRI database of average size. Therefore, how to reduce the data size
   but without losing important information becomes a more and more
   pressing issue. To address this problem, we propose a signal sampling
   approach for significant fMRI data reduction before performing
   structurally-guided dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole
   brain's fMRI data. We compared the proposed structurally guided sampling
   method with no sampling, random sampling and uniform sampling schemes,
   and experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data
   demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve more than 15 times
   speed-up without sacrificing the accuracy in identifying task-evoked
   functional brain networks.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to document current clinical practice and
   report patient outcomes in presurgical language functional MRI (fMRI)
   for epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgical programs worldwide were surveyed
   as to the utility, implementation, and efficacy of language fMRI in the
   clinic; 82 programs responded. Respondents were predominantly US (61\%)
   academic programs (85\%), and evaluated adults (44\%), adults and
   children (40\%), or children only (16\%). Nearly all (96\%) reported
   using language fMRI. Surprisingly, fMRI is used to guide surgical
   margins (44\% of programs) as well as lateralize language (100\%). Sites
   using fMRI for localization most often use a distance margin around
   activation of 10mm. While considered useful, 56\% of programs reported
   at least one instance of disagreement with other measures. Direct brain
   stimulation typically confirmed fMRI findings (74\%) when guiding
   margins, but instances of unpredicted decline were reported by 17\% of
   programs and 54\% reported unexpected preservation of function. Programs
   reporting unexpected decline did not clearly differ from those which did
   not. Clinicians using fMRI to guide surgical margins do not typically
   map known language-critical areas beyond Broca's and Wernicke's. This
   initial data shows many clinical teams are confident using fMRI not only
   for language lateralization but also to guide surgical margins. Reported
   cases of unexpected language preservation when fMRI activation is
   resected, and cases of language decline when it is not, emphasize a
   critical need for further validation. Comprehensive studies comparing
   commonly-used fMRI paradigms to predict stimulation mapping and
   post-surgical language decline remain of high importance.},

Title = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in motor
   neurorehabilitation},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY},

Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {412-418},

Abstract = {Purpose of review
   Recent developments in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have
   catalyzed a new field of translational neuroscience. Using fMRI to
   monitor the aspects of task-related changes in neural activation or
   brain connectivity, investigators can offer feedback of simple or
   complex neural signals/patterns back to the participant on a
   quasireal-time basis {[}real-time-fMRI-based neurofeedback
   (rt-fMRI-NF)]. Here, we introduce some background methodology of the new
   developments in this field and give a perspective on how they may be
   used in neurorehabilitation in the future.
   Recent findings
   The development of rt-fMRI-NF has been used to promote self-regulation
   of activity in several brain regions and networks. In addition, and
   unlike other noninvasive techniques, rt-fMRI-NF can access specific
   subcortical regions and in principle any region that can be monitored
   using fMRI including the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. In
   Parkinson's disease and stroke, rt-fMRI-NF has been demonstrated to
   alter neural activity after the self-regulation training was completed
   and to modify specific behaviours.
   Summary
   Future exploitation of rt-fMRI-NF could be used to induce
   neuroplasticity in brain networks that are involved in certain
   neurological conditions. However, currently, the use of rt-fMRI-NF in
   randomized, controlled clinical trials is in its infancy.},

Title = {The unilateral upper limb classification from fMRI-weighted EEG signals
   using convolutional neural network},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Unilateral upper limb multitasking brings essential
   improvements to stroke rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However,
   the influence and recognition of multiple tasks are core issues in the
   Motor Imagery (MI) system. Methods: First, we design the unilateral
   upper limb MI experimental paradigm and acquire asynchronous functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalogram based on MI
   (MI-EEG) data. Then, Brain activation areas for each task are
   statistically analyzed by fMRI data. A novel fMRI-weighted Convolutional
   Neural Network (CNN) is designed to reassign each channel's weight based
   on brain activation areas to improve classification accuracy. Finally,
   the EEG data is classified by the fMRI-weighted CNN. Results: The four
   classes of MI tasks reflect significant activation in brain motor areas.
   The average classification accuracy of fMRI-weighted CNN is 47.0\%. The
   visualization results show the similarity between fMRI and EEG
   activation areas in the same task. Conclusions: The distinguishability
   of multiple tasks and the influence on motor areas of the brain are
   confirmed by fMRI experiments. The classification accuracy of multitasks
   is improved according to the fMRI-weighted CNN. This paper provides a
   reference for further research into asynchronous fMRI-EEG modeling and
   multitask MI classification.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state fMRI helps identify neural
   networks in presurgical patients who may be limited in their ability to
   undergo task-fMRI. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   accuracy of identifying the language network from resting-state-fMRI
   independent component analysis (ICA) maps.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through
   retrospective analysis, patients who underwent both resting-state-fMRI
   and task-fMRI were compared by identifying the language network from the
   resting-state-fMRI data by 3 reviewers. Blinded to task-fMRI maps, these
   investigators independently reviewed resting-state-fMRI ICA maps to
   potentially identify the language network. Reviewers ranked up to 3 top
   choices for the candidate resting-state-fMRI language map. We evaluated
   associations between the probability of correct identification of the
   language network and some potential factors.RESULTS: Patients included
   29 men and 14 women with a mean age of 41 years. Reviewer 1 (with 17
   years' experience) demonstrated the highest overall accuracy with 72\%;
   reviewers 2 and 3 (with 2 and 7 years' experience, respectively) had a
   similar percentage of correct responses (50\% and 55\%). The highest
   accuracy used ICA50 and the top 3 choices (81\%, 65\%, and 60\% for
   reviewers 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The lowest accuracy used ICA50,
   limiting each reviewer to the top choice (58\%, 35\%, and
   42\%).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate variability in the accuracy of blinded
   identification of resting-state-fMRI language networks across reviewers
   with different years of experience.},

Title = {fMRI as an outcome measure in clinical trials: A systematic review in
   clinicaltrials.gov},
Journal = {BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction More than one-thousand trials with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) as an outcome measure were registered in
   clinicaltrials.gov at the time of writing this article. However, 93\% of
   these registered trials are still not completed with published results
   and there is no picture available about methodological dimensions of
   these ongoing trials with fMRI as an outcome measure.
   Methods We collected trials that use fMRI as an outcome measure in the
   ClinicalTrials.gov registry on 13 October 2018 and reviewed each trial's
   record entry. Eligible trials' characteristics were extracted and
   summarized.
   Results In total, 1,386 clinical trials were identified that reported
   fMRI in their outcome measures with fMRI as the only primary outcome in
   33\% of them. 82\% of fMRI trials were started after 2011. The most
   frequent intervention was drug (pharmacological intervention) (29\%).
   57\% of trials had parallel assignment design and 20\% were designed for
   cross-over assignment. For task-based fMRI, cognitive systems (46\%)
   based on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) was the most frequent domain of
   tasks. Less than one-third of trials (28\%) registered at least one
   region of interest for their analysis. Food cue reactivity task, pain
   perception task, n-back task, and monetary incentive delay task were
   recruited in more than 25 registered trials.
   Conclusion The number of fMRI trials (fMRI as an outcome measure) with
   both task and rest protocols is growing rapidly. Our study suggests a
   growing need for harmonization and standardized checklists on both
   methods and analysis for preregistration of fMRI-based outcomes in
   clinical trials.},

Title = {Language Mapping Using T2-Prepared BOLD Functional MRI in the Presence

Abstract = {At present, presurgical functional mapping is the most prevalent
   clinical application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Signal dropouts and distortions caused by susceptibility effects in the
   current standard echo planar imaging (EPI)-based fMRI images are
   well-known problems and pose a major hurdle for the application of fMRI
   in several brain regions, many of which are related to language mapping
   in presurgical planning. Such artifacts are particularly problematic in
   patients with previous surgical resection cavities, craniotomy hardware,
   hemorrhage, and vascular malformation. A recently developed T2-prepared
   (T2prep) fMRI approach showed negligible distortion and dropouts in the
   entire brain even in the presence of large susceptibility effects. Here,
   we present initial results comparing T2prep-and multiband EPI-fMRI scans
   for presurgical language mapping using a sentence completion task in
   patients with brain tumor and epilepsy. In all patients scanned,
   T2prep-fMRI showed minimal image artifacts (distortion and dropout) and
   greater functional sensitivity than EPI-fMRI around the lesions
   containing blood products and in air-filled cavities. This enhanced
   sensitivity in T2prep-fMRI was also evidenced by the fact that
   functional activation during the sentence completion task was detected
   with T2prep-fMRI but not with EPI-fMRI in the affected areas with the
   same statistical threshold, whereas cerebrovascular reactivity during a
   breath-hold task was preserved in these same regions, implying intact
   neurovascular coupling in these patients. Although further
   investigations are required to validate these findings with invasive
   methods such as direct cortical stimulation mapping as the gold
   standard, this approach provides an alternative method for performing
   fMRI in brain regions with large susceptibility effects.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive tool used
   to probe cognitive and affective processes. Although fMRI provides
   indirect measures of neural activity, the advent of fMRI has allowed for
   1) the corroboration of significant animal findings in the human brain,
   and 2) the expansion of models to include more common human attributes
   that inform behavior. In this review, we briefly consider the neural
   basis of the blood oxygenation level dependent signal to set up a
   discussion of how fMRI studies have applied it in examining cognitive
   models in humans and the promise of using fMRI to advance such models.
   Specifically, we illustrate the contribution that fMRI has made to the
   study of reward processing, focusing on the role of the striatum in
   encoding reward-related learning signals that drive anticipatory and
   consummatory behaviors. For instance, we discuss how fMRI can be used to
   link neural signals (e.g., striatal responses to rewards) to individual
   differences in behavior and traits. While this functional segregation
   approach has been constructive to our understanding of reward-related
   functions, many fMRI studies have also benefitted from a functional
   integration approach that takes into account how interconnected regions
   (e.g., corticostriatal circuits) contribute to reward processing. We
   contend that future work using fMRI will profit from using a multimodal
   approach, such as combining fMRI with noninvasive brain stimulation
   tools (e.g., transcranial electrical stimulation), that can identify
   causal mechanisms underlying reward processing. Consequently,
   advancements in implementing fMRI will promise new translational
   opportunities to inform our understanding of psychopathologies.},

Title = {PEAR: PEriodic And fixed Rank separation for fast fMRI},
Journal = {MEDICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Purpose: In functional MRI (fMRI), faster acquisition via undersampling
   of data can improve the spatial-temporal resolution trade-off and
   increase statistical robustness through increased degrees-of-freedom.
   High-quality reconstruction of fMRI data from undersampled measurements
   requires proper modeling of the data. We present an fMRI reconstruction
   approach based on modeling the fMRI signal as a sum of periodic and
   fixed rank components, for improved reconstruction from undersampled
   measurements.
   Methods: The proposed approach decomposes the fMRI signal into a
   component which has a fixed rank and a component consisting of a sum of
   periodic signals which is sparse in the temporal Fourier domain. Data
   reconstruction is performed by solving a constrained problem that
   enforces a fixed, moderate rank on one of the components, and a limited
   number of temporal frequencies on the other. Our approach is coined PEAR
   - PEriodic And fixed Rank separation for fast fMRI.
   Results: Experimental results include purely synthetic simulation, a
   simulation with real timecourses and retrospective undersampling of a
   real fMRI dataset. Evaluation was performed both quantitatively and
   visually versus ground truth, comparing PEAR to two additional recent
   methods for fMRI reconstruction from undersampled measurements. Results
   demonstrate PEAR's improvement in estimating the timecourses and
   activation maps versus the methods compared against at acceleration
   ratios of R = 8,10.66 (for simulated data) and R = 6.66,10 (for real
   data).
   Conclusions: This paper presents PEAR, an undersampled fMRI
   reconstruction approach based on decomposing the fMRI signal to periodic
   and fixed rank components. PEAR results in reconstruction with higher
   fidelity than when using a fixed-rank based model or a conventional
   Low-rank + Sparse algorithm. We have shown that splitting the functional
   information between the components leads to better modeling of fMRI,
   over state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2017 American Association of

Title = {Sensitivity enhancement of task-evoked fMRI using ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {258},
Pages = {56-66},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used
   to investigate dynamic brain functions in neurological and psychological
   issues; however, high noise level limits its applicability for intensive
   and sophisticated investigations in the field of neuroscience.
   New method: To deal with both issue (low sensitivity and dynamic
   signal), we used ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), an
   adaptive data-driven analysis method for nonstationary and nonlinear
   features, to filter task-irrelevant noise from raw fMRI signals. Using
   both simulations and representative fMRI data, we optimized the analytic
   parameters and identified non-meaningful intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)
   to remove noise.
   Results: We revealed the following advantages of EEMD in fMRI analysis:
   (1) EEMD achieved high detectability for task engagement; (2) the
   functional sensitivity was markedly enhanced by removing task-irrelevant
   artifacts based on EEMD. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared
   with other noise-removal methods (e.g., band-pass filtering and
   independent component analysis), the EEMD-based artifact-removal method
   exhibited better spatial specificity and superior Gaussianity of the
   resulting t-score distribution.
   Conclusions: We found that EEMD method was efficient to enhance the
   functional sensitivity of evoked fMRI. The same strategy would be
   applicable to resting-state fMRI signal in the general purpose. (C) 2015

Title = {Reconstruction of respiratory variation signals from fMRI data},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Functional MRI signals can be heavily influenced by systemic
   physiological processes in addition to local neural activity. For
   example, widespread hemodynamic fluctuations across the brain have been
   found to correlate with natural, low-frequency variations in the depth
   and rate of breathing over time. Acquiring peripheral measures of
   respiration during fMRI scanning not only allows for modeling such
   effects in fMRI analysis, but also provides valuable information for
   interrogating brain-body physiology. However, physiological recordings
   are frequently unavailable or have insufficient quality. Here, we
   propose a computational technique for reconstructing continuous
   low-frequency respiration volume (RV) fluctuations from fMRI data alone.
   We evaluate the performance of this approach across different fMRI
   preprocessing strategies. Further, we demonstrate that the predicted RV
   signals can account for similar patterns of temporal variation in
   resting-state fMRI data compared to measured RV fluctuations. These
   findings indicate that fluctuations in respiration volume can be
   extracted from fMRI alone, in the common scenario of missing or
   corrupted respiration recordings. The results have implications for
   enriching a large volume of existing fMRI datasets through retrospective
   addition of respiratory variations information.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},

Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows for the direct activation
   of neurons in the human neocortex and has proven to be fundamental for
   causal hypothesis testing in cognitive neuroscience. By administering
   TMS concurrently with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the
   effect of cortical TMS on activity in distant cortical and subcortical
   structures can be quantified by varying the levels of TMS output
   intensity. However, TMS generates significant fluctuations in the fMRI
   time series, and their complex interaction warrants caution before
   interpreting findings. We present the methodological challenges of
   concurrent TMS-fMRI and a guide to minimize induced artifacts in
   experimental design and post-processing. Our study targeted two
   frontal-striatal circuits: primary motor cortex (M1) projections to the
   putamen and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to the caudate
   in healthy human participants. We found that TMS parametrically
   increased the BOLD signal in the targeted region and subcortical
   projections as a function of stimulation intensity. Together, this work
   provides practical steps to overcome common challenges with concurrent
   TMS-fMRI and demonstrates how TMS-fMRI can be used to investigate
   functional brain networks.},

Abstract = {Brain functional connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI varies over
   multiple time scales, and recurrent dynamic functional connectivity
   (dFC) states have been identified. These have been found to be
   associated with different cognitive and pathological states, with
   potential as disease biomarkers, but their neuronal underpinnings remain
   a matter of debate. A number of recurrent microstates have also been
   identified in resting-state EEG studies, which are thought to represent
   the quasi-simultaneous activity of large-scale functional networks
   reflecting time-varying brain states. Here, we hypothesized that
   fMRI-derived dFC states may be associated with these EEG microstates. To
   test this hypothesis, we quantitatively assessed the ability of EEG
   microstates to predict concurrent fMRI dFC states in simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI data collected from healthy subjects at rest. By training a
   random forests classifier, we found that the four canonical EEG
   microstates predicted fMRI dFC states with an accuracy of 90\%, clearly
   outperforming alternative EEG features such as spectral power. Our
   results indicate that EEG microstates analysis yields robust signatures
   of fMRI dFC states, providing evidence of the electrophysiological
   underpinnings of dFC while also further supporting that EEG microstates
   reflect the dynamics of large-scale brain networks.},

Abstract = {PurposeAnesthesia is a major confounding factor in functional MRI (fMRI)
   experiments attributed to its effects on brain function. Recent evidence
   suggests that parameters obtained with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are
   coupled with anesthetic depth. Therefore, we investigated whether
   parameters obtained with rs-fMRI, such as functional connectivity (FC),
   are also directly related to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
   responses.
   MethodsA simple rs-fMRI protocol was implemented in a pharmacological
   fMRI study to evaluate the coupling between hemodynamic responses and FC
   under five anesthetics (-chloralose, isoflurane, medetomidine,
   thiobutabarbital, and urethane). Temporal change in the FC was evaluated
   at 1-hour interval. Supplementary forepaw stimulation experiments were
   also conducted.
   ResultsUnder thiobutabarbital anesthesia, FC was clearly coupled with
   nicotine-induced BOLD responses. Good correlation values were also
   obtained under isoflurane and medetomidine anesthesia. The observations
   in the thiobutabarbital group were supported by forepaw stimulation
   experiments. Additionally, the rs-fMRI protocol revealed significant
   temporal changes in the FC in the -chloralose, thiobutabarbital, and
   urethane groups.
   ConclusionOur results suggest that FC can be used to estimate brain
   hemodynamic responsiveness to stimuli and evaluate the level and
   temporal changes of anesthesia. Therefore, analysis of the fMRI baseline
   signal may be highly valuable tool for controlling the outcome of
   preclinical fMRI experiments. Magn Reson Med 78:1136-1146, 2017. (c)

Title = {EEG spatiospectral patterns and their link to fMRI BOLD signal via

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},

Abstract = {Background: Spatial and temporal resolution of brain network activity
   can be improved by combining different modalities. Functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides full brain coverage with limited
   temporal resolution, while electroencephalography (EEG), estimates
   cortical activity with high temporal resolution. Combining them may
   provide improved network characterization.
   New Method: We examined relationships between EEG spatiospectral pattern
   timecourses and concurrent fMRI BOLD signals using canonical hemodynamic
   response function (HRF) with 1st and 2nd temporal derivatives in
   voxel-wise general linear models (GLM). HRF shapes were derived from
   EEG-fMRI time courses during ``resting-state{''}, visual oddball and
   semantic decision paradigms.
   Results: The resulting GLM F-maps self-organized into several different
   large-scale brain networks (LSBNs) often with different timing between
   EEG and fMRI revealed through differences in GLM-derived HRF shapes
   (e.g., with a lower time to peak than the canonical HRF). We demonstrate
   that some EEG spatiospectral patterns (related to concurrent fMRI) are
   weakly task-modulated.
   Comparison with existing method(s): Previously, we demonstrated 14
   independent EEG spatiospectral patterns within this EEG dataset, stable
   across the resting-state, visual oddball and semantic decision
   paradigms. Here, we demonstrate that their time courses are
   significantly correlated with fMRI dynamics organized into LSBN
   structures. EEG-fMRI derived HRF peak appears earlier than the canonical
   HRF peak, which suggests limitations when assuming a canonical HRF shape
   in EEG-fMRI.
   Conclusions: This is the first study examining EEG-fMRI relationships
   among independent EEG spatiospectral patterns over different paradigms.
   The findings highlight the importance of considering different HRF
   shapes when spatiotemporally characterizing brain networks using EEG and
   fMRI.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {The simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalography (EEG) with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a very promising
   non-invasive technique for the study of human brain function. Despite
   continuous improvements, it remains a challenging technique, and a
   standard methodology for data analysis is yet to be established. Here we
   review the methodologies that are currently available to address the
   challenges at each step of the data analysis pipeline. We start by
   surveying methods for preprocessing both EEG and fMRI data. On the EEG
   side, we focus on the correction for several MR-induced artifacts,
   particularly the gradient and pulse artifacts, as well as other sources
   of EEG artifacts. On the fMRI side, we consider image artifacts induced
   by the presence of EEG hardware inside the MR scanner, and the
   contamination of the fMRI signal by physiological noise of non-neuronal
   origin, including a review of several approaches to model and remove it.
   We then provide an overview of the approaches specifically employed for
   the integration of EEG and fMRI when using EEG to predict the blood
   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, the so-called
   EEG-informed fMRI integration strategy, the most commonly used strategy
   in EEG-fMRI research. Finally, we systematically review methods used for
   the extraction of EEG features reflecting neuronal phenomena of
   interest.},

Abstract = {Spontaneous brain activity as assessed with resting-state fMRI exhibits
   rich spatiotemporal structure. However, the principles by which
   brain-wide patterns of spontaneous fMRI activity reconfigure and
   interact with each other remain unclear. We used a framewise clustering
   approach to map spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous fMRI activity
   with voxel resolution in the resting mouse brain. We show that
   brain-wide patterns of fMRI co-activation can be reliably mapped at the
   group and subject level, defining a restricted set of recurring brain
   states characterized by rich network structure. Importantly, we document
   that the identified fMRI states exhibit contrasting patterns of
   functional activity and coupled infraslow network dynamics, with each
   network state occurring at specific phases of global fMRI signal
   fluctuations. Finally, we show that autism-associated genetic
   alterations entail the engagement of atypical functional states and
   altered infraslow network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel set of
   fundamental principles guiding the spatiotemporal organization of
   resting-state fMRI activity and its disruption in brain disorders.},

Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), for many decades acts as a
   potential aiding method for diagnosing medical problems. Several
   successful machine learning algorithms have been proposed in literature
   to extract valuable knowledge from fMRI. One of these algorithms is the
   convolutional neural network (CNN) that competent with high capabilities
   for learning optimal abstractions of fMRI. This is because the CNN
   learns features similarly to human brain where it preserves local
   structure and avoids distortion of the global feature space. Focusing on
   the achievements of using the CNN for the fMRI, and accordingly, the
   Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DCAE) benefits from the datadriven
   approach with CNN's optimal features to strengthen the fMRI
   classification. In this paper, a new two consequent multi-layers DCAE
   deep discriminative approach for classifying fMRI Images is proposed.
   The first DCAE is unsupervised sub-model that is composed of four CNN.
   It focuses on learning weights to utilize discriminative characteristics
   of the extracted features for robust reconstruction of fMRI with lower
   dimensional considering tiny details and refining by its deep multiple
   layers. Then the second DCAE is a supervised sub-model that focuses on
   training labels to reach an outperformed results. The proposed approach
   proved its effectiveness and improved literately reported results on a
   large brain disorder fMRI dataset.},

Title = {On the relationship between instantaneous phase synchrony and
   correlation-based sliding windows for time-resolved fMRI connectivity
   analysis},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {85-94},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Correlation-based sliding window analysis (CSWA) is the most commonly
   used method to estimate time-resolved functional MRI (fMRI)
   connectivity. However, instantaneous phase synchrony analysis (IPSA) is
   gaining popularity mainly because it offers single time-point resolution
   of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. We aim to provide a systematic
   comparison between these two approaches, on temporal, topological and
   anatomical levels.
   For this purpose, we used resting-state fMRI data from two separate
   cohorts with different temporal resolutions (45 healthy subjects from
   Human Connectome Project fMRI data with repetition time of 0.72 s and 25
   healthy subjects from a separate validation fMRI dataset with a
   repetition time of 3 s). For time-resolved functional connectivity
   analysis, we calculated tapered CSWA over a wide range of different
   window lengths that were compared to IPSA.
   We found a strong association in connectivity dynamics between IPSA and
   CSWA when considering the absolute values of CSWA. The association
   between CSWA and IPSA was stronger for a window length of similar to 20s
   (shorter than filtered fMRI wavelength) than similar to 100 s (longer
   than filtered fMRI wavelength), irrespective of the sampling rate of the
   underlying fMRI data. Narrow-band filtering of fMRI data (0.03-0.07 Hz)
   yielded a stronger relationship between IPSA and CSWA than wider-band
   (0.01-0.1 Hz). On a topological level, time-averaged IPSA and CSWA nodes
   were non-linearly correlated for both short (similar to 20 s) and long
   (similar to 100 s) windows, mainly because nodes with strong negative
   correlations (CSWA) displayed high phase synchrony (IPSA). IPSA and CSWA
   were anatomically similar in the default mode network, sensory cortex,
   insula and cerebellum.
   Our results suggest that IPSA and CSWA provide comparable
   characterizations of time-resolved fMRI connectivity for appropriately
   chosen window lengths. Although IPSA requires narrow-band fMRI
   filtering, it does not mandate a (semi-)arbitrary choice of window
   length and window overlap. A code for calculating IPSA is provided.},

Title = {<i>Pypreclin</i>: An automatic pipeline for macaque functional MRI
   preprocessing},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {207},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Non-human primate functional MRI (fMRI) is a growing field in
   neuroscience. However, there is no standardized method for monkey fMRI
   data analysis, specifically for data preprocessing. The preprocessing of
   monkey fMRI data is challenged by several technical and experimental
   specificities of the monkey research such as artifacts related to body
   movements or to intracranial leads. Here we propose to address these
   challenges by developing a new versatile pipeline for macaque fMRI
   preprocessing. We developed a Python module, Pypreclin, to process raw
   images using state of the art algorithms embedded in a fully automatic
   pipeline. To evaluate its robustness, we applied Pypreclin to fMRI data
   acquired at 3T in both awake and anesthetized macaques, with or without
   iron oxide contrast agent, using single loop or multichannel
   phased-array coils, combined or not with intracranial implanted
   electrodes. We performed both resting-state and auditory evoked fMRI and
   compared the results of Pypreclin to a previously employed preprocessing
   pipeline. Pypreclin successfully achieved the registration of the fMRI
   data to the macaque brain template in all the experimental conditions.
   Moreover, Pypreclin enables more accurate locations of auditory evoked
   activations in relation to the gray matter at corrected level in the
   awake fMRI condition. Finally, using the Primate neuroimaging
   Data-Exchange open access platform, we could further validate Pypreclin
   for monkey fMRI images that were acquired a ultra-high fields, from
   other institutions and using different protocols. Pypreclin is a
   validated preprocessing tool that adapts to diverse experimental and
   technical situations of monkey fMRI. Pypreclin code is available on open
   source data sharing platform.},

Abstract = {In this work, we focus on the challenging task, neuro-disease
   classification, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In
   population graph-based disease analysis, graph convolutional neural
   networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success. However, these
   achievements are inseparable from abundant labeled data and sensitive to
   spurious signals. To improve fMRI representation learning and
   classification under a label-efficient setting, we propose a novel and
   theory-driven self-supervised learning (SSL) framework on GCNs, namely
   Graph CCA for Temporal sElf-supervised learning on fMRI analysis (GATE).
   Concretely, it is demanding to design a suitable and effective SSL
   strategy to extract formation and robust features for fMRI. To this end,
   we investigate several new graph augmentation strategies from fMRI
   dynamic functional connectives (FC) for SSL training. Further, we
   leverage canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) on different temporal
   embeddings and present the theoretical implications. Consequently, this
   yields a novel two-step GCN learning procedure comprised of (i) SSL on
   an unlabeled fMRI population graph and (ii) fine-tuning on a small
   labeled fMRI dataset for a classification task. Our method is tested on
   two independent fMRI datasets, demonstrating superior performance on
   autism and dementia diagnosis. Our code is available at

Title = {Building an EEG-fMRI Multi-Modal Brain Graph: A Concurrent EEG-fMRI
   Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {The topological architecture of brain connectivity has been well
   characterized by graph theory based analysis. However, previous studies
   have primarily built brain graphs based on a single modality of brain
   imaging data. Here we develop a framework to construct multi-modal brain
   graphs using concurrent EEG-fMRI data which are simultaneously collected
   during eyes open (EC)) and eyes closed (EC) resting states. FMRI data
   are decomposed into independent components with associated time courses
   by group independent component analysis (ICA). EEG time series are
   segmented, and then spectral power time courses are computed and
   averaged within 5 frequency bands (delta; theta; alpha; beta; low
   gamma). EEG-fMRI brain graphs, with EEG electrodes and fMRI brain
   components serving as nodes, are built by computing correlations within
   and between fMRI ICA time courses and EEG spectral power time courses.
   Dynamic EEG-fMRI graphs are built using a sliding window method, versus
   static ones treating the entire time course as stationary. In global
   level, static graph measures and properties of dynamic graph measures
   are different across frequency bands and are mainly showing higher
   values in eyes closed than eyes open. Nodal level graph measures of a
   few brain components are also showing higher values during eyes closed
   in specific frequency bands. Overall, these findings incorporate fMRI
   spatial localization and EEG frequency information which could not be
   obtained by examining only one modality. This work provides a new
   approach to examine EEG-fMRI associations within a graph theoretic
   framework with potential application to many topics.},

Abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has provided important insights
   into brain physiology. It has become an increasingly popular method for
   presurgical mapping, as an alternative to task-based functional MRI
   wherein the subject performs a task while being scanned. However, there
   is no commonly acknowledged gold standard approach for detecting
   eloquent brain areas using rs-fMRI data in clinical settings. In this
   study, a general linear model-based machine learning (GLM-ML) approach
   was tested to predict individual motor task activation based on rs-fMRI
   data. Its accuracy was then compared to a conventional independent
   component analysis (ICA) approach. 47 healthy subjects were scanned
   using resting state, active and passive motor task fMRI experiments
   using a clinically applicable low-resolution fMRI protocol. The model
   was trained to associate rs-fMRI network maps with that of hand movement
   task fMRI, then used to predict task activation maps for unseen subjects
   solely based on their rs-fMRI data. Our results showed that the GLM-ML
   approach can accurately predict individual differences in task
   activation using rs-fMRI data and outperform conventional ICA to detect
   task activation in the primary sensorimotor region. Furthermore, the
   predicted activation maps using the GLM -ML model matched well with the
   activation of passive hand movement fMRI on an individual basis. These
   results suggest that GLM-ML approach can robustly predict individual
   differences of task activation based on conventional low-resolution
   rs-fMRI data and has important implications for future clinical
   applications.},

Abstract = {During last 20 years, neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in people with drug addictions has introduced a wide
   range of quantitative biomarkers from brain's regional or network level
   activities during different cognitive functions. These quantitative
   biomarkers could be potentially used for assessment, planning,
   prediction, and monitoring for ``addiction medicine{''} during
   screening, acute intoxication, admission to a program, completion of an
   acute program, admission to a long-term program, and postgraduation
   follow-up. In this chapter, we have briefly reviewed main neurocognitive
   targets for fMRI studies associated with addictive behaviors, main study
   types using fMRI among drug dependents, and potential applications for
   fMRI in addiction medicine. Main challenges and limitations for
   extending fMRI studies and evidences aiming at clinical applications in
   addiction medicine are also discussed. There is still a significant gap
   between available evidences from group-based fMRI studies and
   personalized decisions during daily practices in addiction medicine. It
   will be important to fill this gap with large-scale clinical trials and
   longitudinal studies using fMRI measures with a well-defined strategic
   plan for the future.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in
   investigations of normal cognition and brain disease and in various
   clinical applications. Pharmacological fMRI (pharma-fMRI) is a
   relatively new application, which is being used to elucidate the effects
   and mechanisms of pharmacological modulation of brain activity.
   Characterizing the effects of neuropharmacological agents on regional
   brain activity using fMRI is challenging because drugs modulate neuronal
   function in a wide variety of ways, including through receptor agonist,
   antagonist, and neurotransmitter reuptake blocker events. Here we review
   current knowledge on neurotransmitter-mediated blood-oxygen-level
   dependent (BOLD) fMRI mechanisms as well as recently updated
   methodologies aimed at more fully describing the effects of
   neuropharmacologic agents on the BOLD signal. We limit our discussion to
   dopaminergic signaling as a useful lens through which to analyze and
   interpret neurochemical-mediated changes in the hemodynamic BOLD
   response. We also discuss the need for future studies that use
   multi-modal approaches to expand the understanding and application of
   pharma-fMRI.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (MRI) have long been used as tools to examine brain activity. Since both
   methods are very sensitive to changes of synaptic activity, simultaneous
   recording of EEG and fMRI can provide both high temporal and spatial
   resolution. Therefore, the two modalities are now integrated into a
   hybrid tool, EEG-fMRI, which encapsulates the useful properties of the
   two. Among other benefits, EEG-fMRI can contribute to a better
   understanding of brain connectivity and networks. This review lays its
   focus on the methodologies applied in performing EEG-fMRI studies,
   namely techniques used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner,
   artifact removal, and statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. We will
   investigate simultaneous resting-state and task-based EEG-fMRI studies
   and discuss their clinical and technological perspectives. Moreover, it
   is established that the brain regions affected by a task-based neural
   activity might not be limited to the regions in which they have been
   initiated. Advanced methods can help reveal the regions responsible for
   or affected by a developed neural network. Therefore, we have also
   looked into studies related to characterization of structure and
   dynamics of brain networks. The reviewed literature suggests that
   EEG-fMRI can provide valuable complementary information about brain
   neural networks and functions.},

Title = {Resting-State fMRI in Chronic Patients with Disorders of Consciousness:
   The Role of Lower-Order Networks for Clinical Assessment},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique to investigate
   the residual brain functions of patients with Disorders of Consciousness
   (DoC). Nonetheless, it is unclear how the networks that are more
   associated with primary functions, such as the sensory-motor,
   medial/lateral visual and auditory networks, contribute to clinical
   assessment. In this study, we examined the rs-fMRI lower-order networks
   alongside their structural MRI data to clarify the corresponding
   association with clinical assessment. We studied 109 chronic patients
   with DoC and emerged from DoC with structural MRI and rs-fMRI: 65 in
   vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness state (VS/UWS), 34 in
   minimally conscious state (MCS) and 10 with severe disability. rs-fMRI
   data were analyzed with independent component analyses and seed-based
   analyses, in relation to structural MRI and clinical data. The results
   showed that VS/UWS had fewer networks than MCS patients and the rs-fMRI
   activity in each network was decreased. Visual networks were correlated
   to the clinical status, and in cases where no clinical response
   occurred, rs-fMRI indicated distinctive networks conveying information
   in a similar way to other techniques. The information provided by single
   networks was limited, whereas the four networks together yielded better
   classification results, particularly when the model included rs-fMRI and
   structural MRI data (AUC = 0.80). Both quantitative and qualitative
   rs-fMRI analyses yielded converging results; vascular etiology might
   confound the results, and disease duration generally reduced the number
   of networks observed. The lower-order rs-fMRI networks could be used
   clinically to support and corroborate visual function assessments in
   DoC.},

Title = {Disturbed temporal dynamics of episodic retrieval activity with

   impairment: A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Episodic memory (EM) deficit is the core cognitive dysfunction of
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, the episodic
   retrieval pattern detected by functional MRI (fMRI) appears preserved in
   aMCI subjects. To address this discrepancy, simultaneous
   electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI recording was employed to determine
   whether temporal dynamics of brain episodic retrieval activity were
   disturbed in patients with aMCI. Twenty-six aMCI and 29 healthy control
   (HC) subjects completed a word-list memory retrieval task during
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI. The retrieval success activation pattern was
   detected with fMRI analysis, and the familiarity- and
   recollection-related components of episodic retrieval activity were
   identified using event-related potential (ERP) analysis. The
   fMRI-constrained ERP analysis explored the temporal dynamics of brain
   activity in the retrieval success pattern, and the ERP-informed fMRI
   analysis detected fMRI correlates of the ERP components related to
   familiarity and recollection processes. The two groups exhibited similar
   retrieval success patterns in the bilateral posteromedial parietal
   cortex, the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the left lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC). The fMRI-constrained ERP analysis showed that
   the aMCI group did not exhibit old/ new effects in the IPL and LPFC that
   were observed in the HC group. In addition, the aMCI group showed
   disturbed fMRI correlate of ERP recollection component that was
   associated with inferior EM performance. Therefore, in this study, we
   identified disturbed temporal dynamics in episodic retrieval activity
   with a preserved spatial activity pattern in aMCI. Taken together, the
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique demonstrated the potential to identify
   individuals with a high risk of cognitive deterioration.},

Title = {A New Generation of Brain-Computer Interfaces Driven by Discovery of
   Latent EEG-fMRI Linkages Using Tensor Decomposition},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a setup permitting the control of
   external devices by decoding brain activity. Electroencephalography
   (EEG) has been extensively used for decoding brain activity since it is
   non-invasive, cheap, portable, and has high temporal resolution to allow
   real-time operation. Due to its poor spatial specificity, BCIs based on
   EEG can require extensive training and multiple trials to decode brain
   activity (consequently slowing down the operation of the BCI). On the
   other hand, BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   are more accurate owing to its superior spatial resolution and
   sensitivity to underlying neuronal processes which are functionally
   localized. However, due to its relatively low temporal resolution, high
   cost, and lack of portability, fMRI is unlikely to be used for routine
   BCI. We propose a new approach for transferring the capabilities of fMRI
   to EEG, which includes simultaneous EEG/fMRI sessions for finding a
   mapping from EEG to fMRI, followed by a BCI run from only EEG data, but
   driven by fMRI-like features obtained from the mapping identified
   previously. Our novel data-driven method is likely to discover latent
   linkages between electrical and hemodynamic signatures of neural
   activity hitherto unexplored using model-driven methods, and is likely
   to serve as a template for a novel multi-modal strategy wherein
   cross-modal EEG-fMRI interactions are exploited for the operation of a
   unimodal EEG system, leading to a new generation of EEG-based BCIs.},

Title = {Presurgical functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients with brain
   tumors},
Journal = {ACTA RADIOLOGICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-89},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is
   still an upcoming diagnostic tool because it is time-consuming to
   perform the post-scan calculations and interpretations. A standardized
   and easily used method for the clinical assessment of fMRI scans could
   decrease the workload and make fMRI more attractive for clinical use.
   Purpose: To evaluate a standardized clinical approach for distance
   measurement between benign brain tumors and eloquent cortex in terms of
   the ability to predict pre- and postoperative neurological deficits
   after intraoperative neuronavigation-assisted surgery.
   Material and Methods: A retrospective study of 34 patients. The fMRI
   data were reanalyzed using a standardized distance measurement procedure
   combining data from both fMRI and three-dimensional T1 MRI scans. The
   pre- and postoperative neurological status of each patient was obtained
   from hospital records. Data analysis was performed using logistic
   regression analysis to determine whether the distance measured between
   the tumor margin and fMRI activity could serve as a predictor for
   neurological deficits.
   Results: An odds ratio of 0.89mm(-1) (P=0.03) was found between the risk
   of preoperative neurological motor deficits and the tumor-fMRI distance.
   An odds ratio of 0.82mm(-1) (P=0.04) was found between the risk of
   additional postoperative neurological motor deficits and the tumor-fMRI
   distance. The tumor was radically removed in 10 cases; five patients
   experienced additional postoperative motor deficits (tumor-fMRI distance
   <18mm) and five did not (tumor-fMRI distance >18mm) (P=0.008).
   Conclusion: This study indicates that the distance measured between the
   tumor margin and fMRI activation could serve as a valuable predictor of
   neurological motor deficits.},

Title = {Constrained temporal parallel decomposition for EEG-fMRI fusion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective. Multimodal neuroimaging has become a common practice in
   neuroscience research. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a popular multimodal
   recording approach due to the complementary spatiotemporal relationship
   between the two modalities. Several data fusion techniques have been
   proposed in the literature for EEG-fMRI fusion, including joint-ICA and
   parallel-ICA frameworks. Previous EEG-fMRI fusion approaches have used
   sensor-level EEG features. Recently, we introduced source-space ICA for
   EEG-MEG source reconstruction and component identification, which was
   shown to be a superior alternative to sensor-space ICA. Approach. Here,
   we extend source-space ICA to the fusion of EEG-fMRI data. Additionally,
   we incorporate the use of a paradigm signal (constrained) and a
   lag-based signal decomposition approach to accommodate recent findings
   demonstrating the potentially variable lag structure between
   electrophysiological and BOLD signals. We evaluated this method on
   simulated concurrent EEG-fMRI during a boxcar task design, as well as
   real concurrent EEG-fMRI data from three participants performing an
   N-Back working memory task. The block diagram of the algorithm and
   corresponding source codes are provided. Main results. Based on the
   results of the real working memory task, for all three subjects, one
   frontal theta component, and one right posterior alpha component had the
   highest contribution coefficients (similar to 0.5) to the
   paradigm-related fused component. There were also two more alpha band
   components with contribution coefficients of 0.3. The highest
   contributing fMRI component (similar to 0.8) was one known in the
   literature to be related to the attention network. The second fMRI
   component was related to the well-known default mode network, with a
   contribution coefficient of 0.3. Significance. The proposed EEG-fMRI
   fusion approach, is capable of estimating the brain maps of the EEG and
   fMRI for the fused components and account for the variable lag structure
   between electrophysiological and BOLD signals.},

Title = {IClinfMRI Software for Integrating Functional MRI Techniques in
   Presurgical Mapping and Clinical Studies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Task-evoked and resting-state (rs) functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) techniques have been applied to the clinical management of
   neurological diseases, exemplified by presurgical localization of
   eloquent cortex, to assist neurosurgeons in maximizing resection while
   preserving brain functions. In addition, recent studies have recommended
   incorporating cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) imaging into clinical
   fMRI to evaluate the risk of lesion-induced neurovascular uncoupling
   (NVU). Although each of these imaging techniques possesses its own
   advantage for presurgical mapping, a specialized clinical software that
   integrates the three complementary techniques and promptly outputs the
   analyzed results to radiology and surgical navigation systems in a
   clinical format is still lacking. We developed the Integrated fMRI for
   Clinical Research (IClinfMRI) software to facilitate these needs. Beyond
   the independent processing of task-fMRI, rs-fMRI, and CVR mapping,
   IClinfMRI encompasses three unique functions: (1) supporting the
   interactive rs-fMRI mapping while visualizing task-fMRI results (or
   results from published meta-analysis) as a guidance map, (2)
   indicating/visualizing the NVU potential on analyzed fMRI maps, and (3)
   exporting these advanced mapping results in a Digital Imaging and
   Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format that are ready to export to a
   picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and a surgical
   navigation system. In summary, IClinfMRI has the merits of efficiently
   translating and integrating state-of-the-art imaging techniques for
   presurgical functional mapping and clinical fMRI studies.},

Title = {Effects of Field-Map Distortion Correction on Resting State Functional
   Connectivity MRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Magnetic field inhomogeneities cause geometric distortions of echo
   planar images used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To
   reduce this problem, distortion correction (DC) with field map is widely
   used for both task and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Although DC with
   field map has been reported to improve the quality of task fMRI, little
   is known about its effects on rs-fMRI. Here, we tested the influence of
   field-map DC on rs-fMRI results using two rs-fMRI datasets derived from
   40 healthy subjects: one with DC (DC+) and the other without correction
   (DC-). Independent component analysis followed by the dual regression
   approach was used for evaluation of resting-state functional
   connectivity networks (RSN). We also obtained the ratio of low-frequency
   to high-frequency signal power (0.01-0.1 Hz and above 0.1 Hz,
   respectively; LFHF ratio) to assess the quality of rs-fMRI signals. For
   comparison of RSN between DC+ and DC-datasets, the default mode network
   showed more robust functional connectivity in the DC+ dataset than the
   DC-dataset. Basal ganglia RSN showed some decreases in functional
   connectivity primarily in white matter, indicating imperfect
   registration/ normalization without DC. Supplementary seed-based and
   simulation analyses supported the utility of DC. Furthermore, we found a
   higher LFHF ratio after field map correction in the anterior cingulate
   cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and cerebellum. In
   conclusion, field map DC improved detection of functional connectivity
   derived from low-frequency rs-fMRI signals. We encourage researchers to
   include a DC step in the preprocessing pipeline of rs-fMRI analysis.},

Title = {Sources of Variation Influencing Concordance between Functional MRI and
   Direct Cortical Stimulation in Brain Tumor Surgery},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Object: Preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   remains a promising method to aid in the surgical management of patients
   diagnosed with brain tumors. For patients that are candidates for awake
   craniotomies, surgical decisions can potentially be improved by fMRI but
   this depends on the level of concordance between preoperative brain maps
   and the maps provided by the gold standard intraoperative method, direct
   cortical stimulation (DCS). There have been numerous studies of the
   concordance between fMRI and DCS using sensitivity and specificity
   measures, however the results are variable across studies and the key
   factors influencing variability are not well understood. Thus, the
   present work addresses the influence of technical factors on fMRI and
   DCS concordance.
   Methods: Motor and language mapping data were collected for a group of
   glioma patients (n = 14) who underwent both preoperative fMRI and
   intraoperative DCS in an awake craniotomy procedure for tumor removal.
   Normative fMRI data were also acquired in a healthy control group (n =
   12). The fMRI and DOS mapping data were co-registered; true positive
   (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN)
   occurrences were tabulated over the exposed brain surface. Sensitivity
   and specificity were measured for the total group, and for the motor and
   language sub-groups. The influence of grid placement, fMRI statistical
   thresholding, and task standardization were assessed. Correlations
   between proportions of agreement and error were also carefully
   scrutinized to evaluate concordance in more detail.
   Results: Concordance was significantly better for motor vs. language
   mapping. There was an inverse relationship between TP and TN with
   increasing statistical threshold, and FP dominated the total error.
   Sensitivity and specificity were reduced when tasks were not
   standardized across fMRI and DOS.
   Conclusions: Although the agreement between fMRI and DCS is good,
   variability is introduced by technical factors that can diminish the
   quality of patient data. Neurosurgeons should evaluate the usefulness of
   fMRI data while considering that (a) discordance arises primarily from
   FP fMRI results; (b) there is an inherent trade-off between sensitivity
   and specificity with fMRI statistical threshold; and (c) best results
   are achieved using batteries of tasks that are standardized across both
   mapping methods.},

Abstract = {Despite extensive studies detecting laminar functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to illustrate the canonical
   microcircuit, the spatiotemporal characteristics of laminar-specific
   information flow across cortical regions remain to be fully investigated
   in both evoked and resting conditions at different brain states. Here,
   we developed a multislice line-scanning fMRI (MS-LS) method to detect
   laminar fMRI signals in adjacent cortical regions with high spatial (50
   mu m) and temporal resolution (100 ms) in anesthetized rats. Across
   different trials, we detected either laminar-specific positive or
   negative blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the
   surrounding cortical region adjacent to the most activated cortex under
   the evoked condition. Specifically, in contrast to typical Layer (L) 4
   correlation across different regions due to the thalamocortical
   projections for trials with positive BOLD, a strong correlation pattern
   specific in L2/3 was detected for trials with negative BOLD in adjacent
   regions, which indicated brain state-dependent laminar-fMRI responses
   based on corticocortical interaction. Also, in resting-state (rs-) fMRI
   study, robust lag time differences in L2/3, 4, and 5 across multiple
   cortices represented the low-frequency rs-fMRI signal propagation from
   caudal to rostral slices. In summary, our study provided a unique
   laminar fMRI mapping scheme to better characterize trial-specific intra-
   and inter-laminar functional connectivity in evoked and resting-state
   MS-LS.},

Title = {The impact of vasomotion on analysis of rodent fMRI data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {IntroductionSmall animal fMRI is an essential part of translational
   research in the cognitive neurosciences. Due to small dimensions and
   animal physiology preclinical fMRI is prone to artifacts that may lead
   to misinterpretation of the data. To reach unbiased translational
   conclusions, it is, therefore, crucial to identify potential sources of
   experimental noise and to develop correction methods for contributions
   that cannot be avoided such as physiological noise. Aim of this study
   was to assess origin and prevalence of hemodynamic oscillations (HDO) in
   preclinical fMRI in rat, as well as their impact on data analysis.
   MethodsFollowing the development of algorithms for HDO detection and
   suppression, HDO prevalence in fMRI measurements was investigated for
   different anesthetic regimens, comprising isoflurane and medetomidine,
   and for both gradient echo and spin echo fMRI sequences. In addition to
   assessing the effect of vasodilation on HDO, it was studied if HDO have
   a direct neuronal correlate using local field potential (LFP)
   recordings. Finally, the impact of HDO on analysis of fMRI data was
   assessed, studying both the impact on calculation of activation maps as
   well as the impact on brain network analysis. Overall, 303 fMRI
   measurements and 32 LFP recordings were performed in 71 rats. ResultsIn
   total, 62\% of the fMRI measurements showed HDO with a frequency of
   (0.20 +/- 0.02) Hz. This frequent occurrence indicated that HDO cannot
   be generally neglected in fMRI experiments. Using the developed
   algorithms, HDO were detected with a specificity of 95\%, and removed
   efficiently from the signal time courses. HDO occurred brain-wide under
   vasoconstrictive conditions in both small and large blood vessels.
   Vasodilation immediately interrupted HDO, which, however, returned
   within 1 h under vasoconstrictive conditions. No direct neuronal
   correlate of HDO was observed in LFP recordings. HDO significantly
   impacted analysis of fMRI data, leading to altered cluster sizes and
   F-values for activated voxels, as well as altered brain networks, when
   comparing data with and without HDO. DiscussionWe therefore conclude
   that HDO are caused by vasomotion under certain anesthetic conditions
   and should be corrected during fMRI data analysis to avoid bias.},

Abstract = {Estimating effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) time series data has become a very hot topic in
   neuroinformatics and brain informatics. However, it is hard for the
   current methods to accurately estimate the effective connectivity due to
   the high noise and small sample size of fMRI data. In this paper, we
   propose a novel framework for estimating effective connectivity based on
   recurrent generative adversarial networks, called EC-RGAN. The proposed
   framework employs the generator that consists of a set of effective
   connectivity generators based on recurrent neural networks to generate
   the fMRI time series of each brain region, and uses the discriminator to
   distinguish between the joint distributions of the real and generated
   fMRI time series. When the model is well-trained and generated fMRI data
   is similar to real fMRI data, EC-RGAN outputs the effective connectivity
   by means of the causal parameters of the effective connectivity
   generators. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world fMRI
   time series data demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.},

Title = {DC Shifts-fMRI: A Supplement to Event-Related fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Event-related fMRI have been widely used in locating brain regions which
   respond to specific tasks. However, activities of brain regions which
   modulate or indirectly participate in the response to a specific task
   are not event-related. Event-related fMRI can't locate these regulatory
   regions, detrimental to the integrity of the result that event-related
   fMRI revealed. Direct-current EEG shifts (DC shifts) have been found
   linked to the inner brain activity, a fusion DC shifts-fMRI method may
   have the ability to reveal a more complete response of the brain. In
   this study, we used DC shifts-fMRI to verify that even when responding
   to a very simple task, (1) The response of the brain is more complicated
   than event-related fMRI generally revealed and (2) DC shifts-fMRI have
   the ability of revealing brain regions whose responses are not in
   event-related way. We used a classical and simple paradigm which is
   often used in auditory cortex tonotopic mapping. Data were recorded from
   50 subjects (25 male, 25 female) who were presented with randomly
   presented pure tone sequences with six different frequencies (200, 400,
   800, 1,600, 3,200, 6,400 Hz). Our traditional fMRI results are
   consistent with previous findings that the activations are concentrated
   on the auditory cortex. Our DC shifts-fMRI results showed that the
   cingulate-caudate-thalamus network which underpins sustained attention
   is positively activated while the dorsal attention network and the right
   middle frontal gyrus which underpin attention orientation are negatively
   activated. The regional-specific correlations between DC shifts and
   brain networks indicate the complexity of the response of the brain even
   to a simple task and that the DC shifts can effectively reflect these
   non-event-related inner brain activities.},

Title = {Functional MRI applications for intra-axial brain tumours: uses and
   nuances in surgical practise},

Abstract = {Purpose Functional MRI (fMRI) has well-established uses to inform risks
   and plan maximally safe approaches in neurosurgery. In the field of
   brain tumour surgery, however, fMRI is currently in a state of clinical
   equipoise due to debate around both its sensitivity and specificity.
   Materials and methods In this review, we summarise the role and our
   experience of fMRI in neurosurgery for gliomas and metastases. We
   discuss nuances in the conduct and interpretation of fMRI that, based on
   our practise, most directly impact fMRI's usefulness in the
   neurosurgical setting. Results Illustrated examples in which fMRI in our
   hands directly influences the neurosurgical treatment of brain tumours
   include evaluating the probability and nature of functional risks,
   especially for language functions. These presurgical risk assessments,
   in turn, help to predict the resectability of tumours, select or
   deselect patients for awake surgery, indicate the need for
   neurophysiological monitoring and guide the optimal use of
   intra-operative stimulation mapping. A further emerging application of
   fMRI is in measuring functional adaptation of functional networks after
   (partial) surgery, of potential use in the timing of further surgery.
   Conclusions In appropriately selected patients with a clearly defined
   surgical question, fMRI offers a valuable complementary tool in the
   pre-surgical evaluation of brain tumours. However, there is a great need
   for standards in the administration and analysis of fMRI as much as in
   the techniques that it is commonly evaluated against. Surprisingly
   little data exists that evaluates the accuracy of fMRI not just against
   complementary methods, but in terms of its ultimate clinical aim of
   minimising post-surgical morbidity.},

Title = {Brain State Decoding Based on fMRI Using Semisupervised Sparse
   Representation Classifications},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Multivariate classification techniques have been widely applied to
   decode brain states using functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Due to variabilities in fMRI data and the limitation of the collection
   of human fMRI data, it is not easy to train an efficient and robust
   supervised-learning classifier for fMRI data. Among various
   classification techniques, sparse representation classifier (SRC)
   exhibits a state-of-the-art classification performance in image
   classification. However, SRC has rarely been applied to fMRI-based
   decoding. This study aimed to improve SRC using unlabeled testing
   samples to allow it to be effectively applied to fMRI-based decoding. We
   proposed a semisupervised-learning SRC with an average coefficient
   (semiSRC-AVE) method that performed the classification using the average
   coefficient of each class instead of the reconstruction error and
   selectively updated the training dataset using new testing data with
   high confidence to improve the performance of SRC. Simulated and real
   fMRI experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility and
   robustness of semiSRC-AVE. The results of the simulated and real fMRI
   experiments showed that semiSRC-AVE significantly outperformed
   supervised learning SRC with an average coefficient (SRC-AVE) method and
   showed better performance than the other three semisupervised learning
   methods.},

   Link) that provides a hardware solution for simultaneous
   electrophysiological and fMRI signal acquisition. The device detects the
   changes in the electromagnetic field during fMRI to synchronize
   amplification and sampling of electrophysiological signals with minimal
   artifacts. It wirelessly transmits the recorded data at a frequency
   detectable by the MR-receiver coil. The transmitted data is readily
   separable from MRI in the frequency domain. To demonstrate its efficacy,
   we used this device to record electrocardiograms and somatosensory
   evoked potential during concurrent fMRI scans. The device minimized the
   fMRI-induced artifacts in electrophysiological data and wirelessly
   transmitted the data back to the receiver coil without compromising the
   fMRI signal quality. The device is compact (22 mm dia., 2 gms) and can
   be placed within the MRI bore to precisely synchronize with fMRI.
   Therefore, MR-Link offers an inexpensive system by eliminating the need
   for amplifiers with a high dynamic range, high-speed sampling,
   additional storage, or synchronization hardware for electrophysiological
   signal acquisition. It is expected to enable a broader range of
   applications of simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiology in animals and
   humans.},

Title = {Increased fMRI connectivity upon chemogenetic inhibition of the mouse

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {While shaped and constrained by axonal connections, fMRI-based
   functional connectivity reorganizes in response to varying interareal
   input or pathological perturbations. However, the causal contribution of
   regional brain activity to whole-brain fMRI network organization remains
   unclear. Here we combine neural manipulations, resting-state fMRI and in
   vivo electrophysiology to probe how inactivation of a cortical node
   causally affects brain-wide fMRI coupling in the mouse. We find that
   chronic inhibition of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) via
   overexpression of a potassium channel increases fMRI connectivity
   between the inhibited area and its direct thalamo-cortical targets.
   Acute chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC produces analogous patterns of
   fMRI overconnectivity. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we find that
   chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC enhances low frequency (0.1-4 Hz)
   oscillatory power via suppression of neural firing not phase-locked to
   slow rhythms, resulting in increased slow and delta band coherence
   between areas that exhibit fMRI overconnectivity. These results provide
   causal evidence that cortical inactivation can counterintuitively
   increase fMRI connectivity via enhanced, less-localized slow oscillatory
   processes.
   Pathological perturbation affects whole brain network activity. Here the
   authors show in mice that cortical inactivation unexpectedly results in
   increased fMRI connectivity between the manipulated regions and its
   direct axonal targets.},

Abstract = {Whole-brain fMRI signals are a subject of intense interest: variance in
   the global fMRI signal (the spatial mean of all signals in the brain)
   indexes subject arousal, and psychiatric conditions such as
   schizophrenia and autism have been characterized by differences in the
   global fMRI signal. Further, vigorous debates exist on whether global
   signals ought to be removed from fMRI data. However, surprisingly little
   research has focused on the empirical properties of whole-brain fMRI
   signals. Here we map the spatial and temporal properties of the global
   signal, individually, in 1000+ fMRI scans. Variance in the global fMRI
   signal is strongly linked to head motion, to hardware artifacts, and to
   respiratory patterns and their attendant physiologic changes. Many
   techniques used to prepare fMRI data for analysis fail to remove these
   uninteresting kinds of global signal fluctuations. Thus, many studies
   include, at the time of analysis, prominent global effects of yawns,
   breathing changes, and head motion, among other signals. Such artifacts
   will mimic dynamic neural activity and will spuriously alter signal
   covariance throughout the brain. Methods capable of isolating and
   removing global artifactual variance while preserving putative
   ``neural{''} variance are needed; this paper adopts no position on the
   topic of global signal regression.},

Title = {fMRI at High Spatial Resolution: Implications for BOLD-Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {As high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and fMRI
   of cortical layers become more widely used, the question how well
   high-resolution fMRI signals reflect the underlying neural processing,
   and how to interpret laminar fMRI data becomes more and more relevant.
   High-resolution fMRI has shown laminar differences in cerebral blood
   flow (CBF), volume (CBV), and neurovascular coupling. Features and
   processes that were previously lumped into a single voxel become
   spatially distinct at high resolution. These features can be vascular
   compartments such as veins, arteries, and capillaries, or cortical
   layers and columns, which can have differences in metabolism. Mesoscopic
   models of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response
   therefore need to be expanded, for instance, to incorporate laminar
   differences in the coupling between neural activity, metabolism and the
   hemodynamic response. Here we discuss biological and methodological
   factors that affect the modeling and interpretation of high-resolution
   fMRI data. We also illustrate with examples from neuropharmacology and
   the negative BOLD response how combining BOLD with CBF- and CBV-based
   fMRI methods can provide additional information about neurovascular
   coupling, and can aid modeling and interpretation of high-resolution
   fMRI.},

Title = {Task-induced changes in brain entropy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Entropy indicates irregularity of a dynamic system, with higher entropy
   indicating higher irregularity and more transit states. In the human
   brain, regional brain entropy (BEN) has been increasingly assessed using
   resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), while changes of regional BEN during
   task-based fMRI have been scarcely studied. The purpose of this study is
   to characterize task-induced regional BEN alterations using the large
   Human Connectome Project (HCP) data. To control the potential modulation
   by the block design, BEN of task-fMRI was calculated from the fMRI
   images acquired during the task conditions only (task BEN) and then
   compared to BEN of rs-fMRI (resting BEN). Moreover, BEN was separately
   calculated from the control blocks of the task-fMRI runs (control BEN)
   and compared to task BEN. Finally, control BEN was compared to resting
   BEN to test for residual task effects in the control condition. With
   respect to resting state, task performance unanimously induced BEN
   reduction in the peripheral cortical area and BEN increase in the
   centric part of the sensorimotor and perception networks. Control
   compared to resting BEN showed similar entropy alterations, suggesting
   large residual task effects. Task compared to control BEN was
   characterized by reduced entropy in occipital, orbitofrontal, and
   parietal regions.
   Brain entropy (BEN) represents a unique method to characterize brain
   activity at rest and during task performance. In this study, we compare
   BEN estimated during resting state, task performance, and fixation
   blocks of task-fMRI. Our results provide new insight into BEN
   modifications during task performance involving higher-level cognitive
   functions.image},

Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Quality control (QC) is an important stage for functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. The methods for fMRI QC vary in
   different fMRI preprocessing pipelines. The inflating sample size and
   number of scanning sites for fMRI studies further add to the difficulty
   and working load of the QC procedure. Therefore, as a constituent part
   of the Demonstrating Quality Control Procedures in fMRI research topic
   in Frontiers, we preprocessed a well-organized open-available dataset
   using DPABI pipelines to illustrate the QC procedure in DPABI. Six
   categories of DPABI-derived reports were used to eliminate images
   without adequate quality. After the QC procedure, twelve participants
   (8.6\%) were categorized as excluded and eight participants (5.8\%) were
   categorized as uncertain. More automatic QC tools were needed in the
   big-data era while visually inspecting images was still indispensable
   now.},

Title = {Sequential Dictionary Learning From Correlated Data: Application to fMRI
   Data Analysis},

Abstract = {Sequential dictionary learning via the K-SVD algorithm has been revealed
   as a successful alternative to conventional data driven methods, such as
   independent component analysis for functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) data analysis. fMRI data sets are however structured data
   matrices with notions of spatio-temporal correlation and temporal
   smoothness. This prior information has not been included in the K-SVD
   algorithm when applied to fMRI data analysis. In this paper, we propose
   three variants of the K-SVD algorithm dedicated to fMRI data analysis by
   accounting for this prior information. The proposed algorithms differ
   from the K-SVD in their sparse coding and dictionary update stages. The
   first two algorithms account for the known correlation structure in the
   fMRI data by using the squared Q, R-norm instead of the Frobenius norm
   for matrix approximation. The third and last algorithms account for both
   the known correlation structure in the fMRI data and the temporal
   smoothness. The temporal smoothness is incorporated in the dictionary
   update stage via regularization of the dictionary atoms obtained with
   penalization. The performance of the proposed dictionary learning
   algorithms is illustrated through simulations and applications on real
   fMRI data.},

Title = {Task-induced changes in brain entropy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Entropy indicates irregularity of a dynamic system, with higher entropy
   indicating higher irregularity and more transit states. In the human
   brain, regional brain entropy (BEN) has been increasingly assessed using
   resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), while changes of regional BEN during
   task-based fMRI have been scarcely studied. The purpose of this study is
   to characterize task-induced regional BEN alterations using the large
   Human Connectome Project (HCP) data. To control the potential modulation
   by the block design, BEN of task-fMRI was calculated from the fMRI
   images acquired during the task conditions only (task BEN) and then
   compared to BEN of rs-fMRI (resting BEN). Moreover, BEN was separately
   calculated from the control blocks of the task-fMRI runs (control BEN)
   and compared to task BEN. Finally, control BEN was compared to resting
   BEN to test for residual task effects in the control condition. With
   respect to resting state, task performance unanimously induced BEN
   reduction in the peripheral cortical area and BEN increase in the
   centric part of the sensorimotor and perception networks. Control
   compared to resting BEN showed similar entropy alterations, suggesting
   large residual task effects. Task compared to control BEN was
   characterized by reduced entropy in occipital, orbitofrontal, and
   parietal regions.
   Brain entropy (BEN) represents a unique method to characterize brain
   activity at rest and during task performance. In this study, we compare
   BEN estimated during resting state, task performance, and fixation
   blocks of task-fMRI. Our results provide new insight into BEN
   modifications during task performance involving higher-level cognitive
   functions.image},

Title = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Functional Near-Infrared
   Spectroscopy: Insights from Combined Recording Studies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Although blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely available, non-invasive technique
   that offers excellent spatial resolution, it remains limited by
   practical constraints imposed by the scanner environment. More recently,
   functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as an
   alternative hemodynamic-based approach that possesses a number of
   strengths where fMRI is limited, most notably in portability and higher
   tolerance for motion. To date, fNIRS has shown promise in its ability to
   shed light on the functioning of the human brain in populations and
   contexts previously inaccessible to fMRI. Notable contributions include
   infant neuroimaging studies and studies examining full-body behaviors,
   such as exercise. However, much like fMRI, fNIRS has technical
   constraints that have limited its application to clinical settings,
   including a lower spatial resolution and limited depth of recording.
   Thus, by combining fMRI and fNIRS in such a way that the two methods
   complement each other, a multimodal imaging approach may allow for more
   complex research paradigms than is feasible with either technique alone.
   In light of these issues, the purpose of the current review is to: (1)
   provide an overview of fMRI and fNIRS and their associated strengths and
   limitations; (2) review existing combined fMRI-fNIRS recording studies;
   and (3) discuss how their combined use in future research practices may
   aid in advancing modern investigations of human brain function.},

   Multimodal Fusion Analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Recently, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) multimodal fusion has been pursued in an effort
   to study human brain function and dysfunction to obtain more
   comprehensive information on brain activity in which the spatial and
   temporal resolutions are both satisfactory. However, a more flexible and
   easy-to-use toolbox for EEG-fMRI multimodal fusion is still lacking. In
   this study, we therefore developed a freely available and open-source
   MATLAB graphical user interface toolbox, known as the Neuroscience
   Information Toolbox (NIT), for EEG-fMRI multimodal fusion analysis. The
   NIT consists of three modules: (1) the fMRI module, which has batch fMRI
   preprocessing, nuisance signal removal, bandpass filtering, and
   calculation of resting-state measures; (2) the EEG module, which
   includes artifact removal, extracting EEG features (event onset, power,
   and amplitude), and marking interesting events; and (3) the fusion
   module, in which fMRI-informed EEG analysis and EEG-informed fMRI
   analysis are included. The NIT was designed to provide a convenient and
   easy-to-use toolbox for researchers, especially for novice users. The
   NIT can be downloaded for free at
   http://www.neuro.uestc.edu.cn/NIT.html, and detailed information,
   including the introduction of NIT, user's manual and example data sets,
   can also be observed on this website. We hope that the NIT is a
   promising toolbox for exploring brain information in various EEG and
   fMRI studies.},

Title = {A guide to using functional magnetic resonance imaging to study
   Alzheimer's disease in animal models},
Journal = {DISEASE MODELS \& MECHANISMS},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a leading healthcare challenge facing our society
   today. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has
   played an important role in our efforts to understand how Alzheimer's
   disease alters brain function. Using fMRI in animal models of
   Alzheimer's disease has the potential to provide us with a more
   comprehensive understanding of the observations made in human clinical
   fMRI studies. However, using fMRI in animal models of Alzheimer's
   disease presents some unique challenges. Here, we highlight some of
   these challenges and discuss potential solutions for researchers
   interested in performing fMRI in animal models. First, we briefly
   summarize our current understanding of Alzheimer's disease from a
   mechanistic standpoint. We then overview the wide array of animal models
   available for studying this disease and how to choose the most
   appropriate model to study, depending on which aspects of the condition
   researchers seek to investigate. Finally, we discuss the contributions
   of fMRI to our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and the issues to
   consider when designing fMRI studies for animal models, such as
   differences in brain activity based on anesthetic choice and ways to
   interrogate more specific questions in rodents beyond those that can be
   addressed in humans. The goal of this article is to provide information
   on the utility of fMRI, and approaches to consider when using fMRI, for
   studies of Alzheimer's disease in animal models.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive access
   to the awake, behaving human brain. By tracking whole-brain signals
   across a diverse range of cognitive and behavioural states or mapping
   differences associated with specific traits or clinical conditions, fMRI
   has advanced our understanding of brain function and its links to both
   normal and atypical behaviour. Despite this headway, progress in human
   cognitive neuroscience that uses fMRI has been relatively isolated from
   rapid advances in other subdomains of neuroscience, which themselves are
   also somewhat siloed from one another. In this Perspective, we argue
   that fMRI is well-placed to integrate the diverse subfields of systems,
   cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience. We first summarize
   the strengths and weaknesses of fMRI as an imaging tool, then highlight
   examples of studies that have successfully used fMRI in each subdomain
   of neuroscience. We then provide a roadmap for the future advances that
   will be needed to realize this integrative vision. In this way, we hope
   to demonstrate how fMRI can help usher in a new era of interdisciplinary
   coherence in neuroscience.
   This Perspective reviews successful applications of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and presents a case for fMRI as a central hub
   on which to integrate the dispersed subfields of systems, cognitive,
   computational and clinical neuroscience.},

Abstract = {While the relationship between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   measurements and training effects is explored by Voelker et al. (this
   issue), a cursory discussion of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) measurements categorizes increased activation with findings of
   greater white matter integrity. Evidence of the relationship between
   fMRI activation and white matter integrity is conflicting, as is the
   relationship between fMRI activation and training effects. An
   examination of the changes in fMRI activation in response to training is
   helpful, but the relationship between DTI and fMRI activation,
   particularly in the context of white matter changes, must be examined
   further before general conclusions can be drawn.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {247},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Despite extensive efforts to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
   fMRI images for brain-wide mapping, tech-nical advances of focal brain
   signal enhancement are lacking, in particular, for animal brain imaging.
   Emerging studies have combined fMRI with fiber optic-based optogenetics
   to decipher circuit-specific neuromodulation from meso to macroscales.
   High-resolution fMRI is needed to integrate hemodynamic responses into
   cross-scale functional dynamics, but the SNR remains a limiting factor
   given the complex implantation setup of animal brains. Here, we
   developed a multimodal fMRI imaging platform with an implanted inductive
   coil detector. This detector boosts the tSNR of MRI images, showing a
   2-3-fold sensitivity gain over conventional coil configuration. In
   contrast to the cryoprobe or array coils with limited spaces for
   implanted brain interface, this setup offers a unique advantage to study
   brain circuit connectivity with optogenetic stimulation and can be
   further extended to other multimodal fMRI mapping schemes.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare localization of
   the language cortex using cortical stimulation mapping (CSM), high gamma
   electrocorticography (hgECoG), functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
   Methods: Language mapping using CSM, hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS were compared
   in nine patients with epilepsy. Considering CSM as reference, we
   compared language mapping approaches based on hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS
   using their sensitivity, specificity, and the results of receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.
   Results: Our results show that areas involved in language processing can
   be identified by hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS. The average
   sensitivity/specificity of hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS across all patients was
   100\%/85\%, 50\%/80\%, and 67\%/66\%, respectively. The average area
   under the ROC curve of hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS across CSM-positive
   patients was 0.98, 0.76, and 0.68, respectively.
   Conclusions: There is considerable concordance between CSM, hgECoG,
   fMRI, and TMS language mapping. Our results reveal that hgECoG, fMRI,
   and TMS are valuable tools for presurgical language mapping.
   Significance: Language mapping on the basis of hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS can
   provide important additional information, therefore, these methods can
   be used in conjunction with CSM or as an alternative, when the latter is
   deemed impractical. (c) 2015 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI is a common technique for
   measuring brain activation that could be affected by low-level carbon
   monoxide (CO) exposure from, e.g. smoking. This study aimed to probe the
   vulnerability of BOLD fMRI to CO and determine whether it may constitute
   a significant neuroimaging confound. Low-level (6ppm exhaled) CO effects
   on BOLD response were assessed in 12 healthy never-smokers on two
   separate experimental days (CO and air control). fMRI tasks were
   breath-holds (hypercapnia), visual stimulation and fingertapping. BOLD
   fMRI response was lower during breath holds, visual stimulation and
   fingertapping in the CO protocol compared to the air control protocol.
   Behavioural and physiological measures remained unchanged. We conclude
   that BOLD fMRI might be vulnerable to changes in baseline CO, and
   suggest exercising caution when imaging populations exposed to elevated
   CO levels. Further work is required to fully elucidate the impact on CO
   on fMRI and its underlying mechanisms.},

Abstract = {With advances in methods for collecting and analyzing fMRI data, there
   is a concurrent need to understand how to reliably evaluate and
   optimally use these methods. Simulations of fMRI data can aid in both
   the evaluation of complex designs and the analysis of data. We present
   fmrisim, a new Python package for standardized, realistic simulation of
   fMRI data. This package is part of BrainIAK: a recently released
   open-source Python toolbox for advanced neuroimaging analyses. We
   describe how to use fmrisim to extract noise properties from real fMRI
   data and then create a synthetic dataset with matched noise properties
   and a user-specified signal. We validate the noise generated by fmrisim
   to show that it can approximate the noise properties of real data. We
   further show how fmrisim can help researchers find the optimal design in
   terms of power. The fmrisim package holds promise for improving the
   design of fMRI experiments, which may facilitate both the
   pre-registration of such experiments as well as the analysis of fMRI
   data.},

Title = {A New fMRI Informed Mixed-Norm Constrained Algorithm for EEG Source
   Localization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {8258-8269},
Abstract = {Complementary with electroencephalograph (EEG), functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), with high spatial resolution, is powerful at
   providing prior source locations based on actual brain physiology. It
   hereby can help improve the accuracy of EEG source localization.
   However, most of the current methods directly penalize the sources whose
   fMRI activation probability is low and estimate the sources activities
   at every time point. Thus, they do not account for the temporal
   interrelated and non-stationary features of electromagnetic brain
   signals, and some are too much dependent on the fMRI prior. Here, we
   propose a new fMRI informed EEG source localization method and is termed
   fMRI-informed spatio-temporal unifying tomography (FIST). It uses a
   mixed norm constraint defined in terms of time frequency decomposition
   of the sources and combines it with fMRI prior. The Fast Iterative
   Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm is employed to solve the optimization
   problem. Both simulated and real EEG data are applied to assess the
   performance of the proposed method. Compared with L2-norm constrained
   methods, FIST has the superiority brain source estimation both in the
   spatial and temporal domains. By virtue of the fMRI information as a
   prior, FIST has great improvement in spatial accuracy and computational
   efficiency, when comparing with the method which only uses mixed-norm
   constraint. In addition, FIST shows good ability to select the fMRI
   priors to get a better estimation without totally depending on the
   prior, when comparing with the method which also has fMRI prior
   information.},

Abstract = {Neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has emerged as a
   presurgical language mapping tool distinct from the widely used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We report fMRI and nTMS
   language-mapping results in 19 pediatric-epilepsy patients and compare
   those to definitive testing by electrical cortical stimulation, Wada
   test, and/or neuropsychological testing. Most discordant results
   occurred when fMRI found right-hemispheric language. In those cases,
   when nTMS showed left-hemispheric or bilateral language representation,
   left-hemispheric language was confirmed by definitive testing.
   Therefore, we propose nTMS should be considered for pediatric
   presurgical language-mapping when fMRI shows right-hemispheric language,
   with nTMS results superseding fMRI results in those scenarios.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques using the
   blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal have shown great potential as
   clinical biomarkers of disease. Thus, using these techniques in
   preclinical rodent models is an urgent need. Calibrated fMRI is a
   promising technique that can provide high-resolution mapping of cerebral
   oxygen metabolism (CMRO2). However, calibrated fMRI is difficult to use
   in rodent models for several reasons: rodents are anesthetized,
   stimulation-induced changes are small, and gas challenges induce noisy
   CMRO2 predictions. We used, in mice, a relaxometry-based calibrated fMRI
   method which uses cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the BOLD-sensitive
   magnetic relaxation component, R-2 `, the same parameter derived in the
   deoxyhemoglobin-dilution model of calibrated fMRI. This method does not
   use any gas challenges, which we tested on mice in both awake and
   anesthetized states. As anesthesia induces a whole-brain change, our
   protocol allowed us to overcome the former limitations of rodent studies
   using calibrated fMRI. We revealed 1.5-2 times higher CMRO2, dependent
   upon brain region, in the awake state versus the anesthetized state. Our
   results agree with alternative measurements of whole-brain CMRO2 in the
   same mice and previous human anesthesia studies. The use of calibrated
   fMRI in rodents has much potential for preclinical fMRI.},

Title = {Coil Compression in Simultaneous Multislice Functional MRI with
   Concentric Ring Slice-GRAPPA and SENSE},

Abstract = {Purpose: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a useful way to
   accelerate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As acceleration
   becomes more aggressive, an increasingly larger number of receive coils
   are required to separate the slices, which significantly increases the
   computational burden. We propose a coil compression method that works
   with concentric ring non-Cartesian SMS imaging and should work with
   Cartesian SMS as well. We evaluate the method on fMRI scans of several
   subjects and compare it to standard coil compression methods.
   Methods: The proposed method uses a slice-separation k-space kernel to
   simultaneously compress coil data into a set of virtual coils. Five
   subjects were scanned using both non-SMS fMRI and SMS fMRI with three
   simultaneous slices. The SMS fMRI scans were processed using the
   proposed method, along with other conventional methods. Code is
   available at https://github.com/alcu/sms.
   Results: The proposed method maintained functional activation with a
   fewer number of virtual coils than standard SMS coil compression
   methods. Compression of non-SMS fMRI maintained activation with a
   slightly lower number of virtual coils than the proposed method, but
   does not have the acceleration advantages of SMS fMRI.
   Conclusion: The proposed method is a practical way to compress and
   reconstruct concentric ring SMS data and improves the preservation of
   functional activation over standard coil compression methods in fMRI.

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation (also known as
   fMRI repetition suppression) has been widely used to characterize
   stimulus selectivity in vivo, a fundamental feature of neuronal
   processing in the brain. We investigated whether SZ patients and BD
   patients show aberrant fMRI adaptation for object perception. About 52
   SZ patients, 55 BD patients, and 53 community controls completed an
   object discrimination task with three conditions: the same object
   presented twice, two exemplars from the same category, and two exemplars
   from different categories. We also administered two functional localizer
   tasks. A region of interest analysis was employed to evaluate a priori
   hypotheses about the lateral occipital complex (LOC) and early visual
   cortex (EVC). An exploratory whole brain analysis was also conducted. In
   the LOC and EVC, controls showed the expected reduced fMRI responses to
   repeated presentation of the same objects compared with different
   objects (i.e., fMRI adaptation for objects, p<.001). SZ patients showed
   an adaptation effect that was significantly smaller compared with
   controls. BD patients showed a lack of fMRI adaptation. The whole brain
   analyses showed enhanced fMRI responses to repeated presentation of the
   same objects only in BD patients in several brain regions including
   anterior cingulate cortex. This study was the first to employ fMRI
   adaptation for objects in SZ and BD. The current findings provide
   empirical evidence of aberrant fMRI adaptation in the visual cortex in
   SZ and BD, but in distinctly different ways.},

Abstract = {Combined fMRI-MRS is a novel method to non-invasively investigate
   functional activation in the human brain using simultaneous acquisition
   of hemodynamic and neurochemical measures. The aim of the current study
   was to quantify neural activity using combined fMRI-MRS at 7 T.
   BOLD-fMRI and semi-LASER localization MRS data were acquired from the
   visual cortex of 13 participants during short blocks (64 s) of
   flickering checkerboards. We demonstrate a correlation between glutamate
   and BOLD-fMRI time courses (R=0.381, p=0.031). In addition, we show
   increases in BOLD-fMRI (1.43 +/- 0.17\%) and glutamate concentrations
   (0.15 +/- 0.05 I. U., similar to 2\%) during visual stimulation. In
   contrast, we observed no change in glutamate concentrations in resting
   state MRS data during sham stimulation periods. Spectral line width
   changes generated by the BOLD-response were corrected using line
   broadening. In summary, our results establish the feasibility of
   concurrent measurements of BOLD-fMRI and neurochemicals using a novel
   combined fMRI-MRS sequence. Our findings strengthen the link between
   glutamate and functional activity in the human brain by demonstrating a
   significant correlation of BOLD-fMRI and glutamate over time, and by
   showing similar to 2\% glutamate increases during 64 s of visual
   stimulation. Our tool may become useful for studies characterizing
   functional dynamics between neurochemicals and hemodynamics in health
   and disease.},

Abstract = {Adaptation has been widely used in functional magnetic imaging (fMRI)
   studies to infer neuronal response properties in human cortex. fMRI
   adaptation has been criticized because of the complex relationship
   between fMRI adaptation effects and the multiple neuronal effects that
   could underlie them. Many of the longstanding concerns about fMRI
   adaptation have received empirical support from neurophysiological
   studies over the last decade. We review these studies here, and also
   consider neuroimaging studies that have investigated how fMRI adaptation
   effects are influenced by high-level perceptual processes. The results
   of these studies further emphasize the need to interpret fMRI adaptation
   results with caution, but they also provide helpful guidance for more
   accurate interpretation and better experimental design. In addition, we
   argue that rather than being used as a proxy for measurements of
   neuronal stimulus selectivity, fMRI adaptation may be most useful for
   studying population-level adaptation effects across cortical processing
   hierarchies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the hemodynamic
   response to active neurons. The most prevailing fMRI contrast, blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, specifically results from a
   complex interplay between oxygen metabolism, blood flow, and blood
   volume reactions. Therefore, because fMRI indirectly measures brain
   function, the spatial accuracy of these blood-borne signal changes to
   the true neuronal activity comes into question, especially at high
   resolutions. To better interpret the neural basis of fMRI, these
   properties have been studied in localized neural circuits of the brain
   using fMRI with blood flow, blood volume, and BOLD contrasts, as well as
   optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI), which shares similar signal
   sources as fMRI. Here, we review how submillimeter-scale high-resolution
   fMRI and OISI in the visual cortex columnar and olfactory bulb laminar
   models have advanced our basic knowledge of the spatial localization of
   the individual hemodynamic signals and neurovascular coupling
   mechanisms.},

Title = {Comparison of BOLD, diffusion-weighted fMRI and ADC-fMRI for stimulation
   of the primary visual system with a block paradigm},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {123-131},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect is extensively used for
   functional MRI (fMRI) but presents some limitations. Diffusion-weighted
   fMRI (DfMRI) has been proposed as a method more tightly linked to
   neuronal activity. This work proposes a protocol of DfMRI acquired for
   several b-values and diffusion directions that is compared to
   gradient-echo BOLD (GE-BOLD) and to repeated spin-echo BOLD (SE-BOLD,
   acquisitions performed with b = 0 s/mm(2)), which was also used to
   ensure the reproducibility of the response.
   A block stimulation paradigm of the primary visual system (V1) was
   performed in 12 healthy subjects with checkerboard alternations (2 Hz
   frequency). DfMRI was performed at 3 T with 5 b-values (b = 1500, 1000,
   500, 250, 0 s/mm(2)) with TR/TE = 1004/93 ms, Delta/delta = 45.4 ms/30
   ms, and 6 spatial directions for diffusion measures. GE-BOLD was
   performed with a similar block stimulation design timing. Apparent
   Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)-fMRI was computed with all b-values used. An
   identical Z-score level was used for all fMRI modalities for the
   comparison of volumes of activation. ADC-fMRI and SE-BOLD fMRI
   activation locations were compared in a voxel-based analysis to a
   cytoarchitectural probability map of Vl.
   SE-BOLD activation volumes represented only 55\% of the GE-BOLD
   activation volumes (P < 0.0001). DfMRI activation volumes averaged for
   all b-values acquired represented only 12\% of GE-BOLD (P < 0.0001) and
   only 22\% of SE-BOLD activation volumes (P < 0.005). Compared to
   SE-BOLD-fMRI, ADC-fMRI activations showed fewer pixels outside of V1 and
   a higher average probability of belonging to V1.
   DfMRI and ADC-fMRI acquisition at 3 T could be easily post-processed
   with common neuro-imaging software. DfMRI and ADC-fMRI activation
   volumes were significantly smaller than those obtained with SE-BOLD.
   ADCfMRI activations were more precisely localized in V1 than those of
   SE-BOLD-fMRI. This validated the increased capability of ADC-fMRI
   compared to BOLD to enhance the precision of localizing an fMRI
   activation in the cytoarchitectural zone V1, thereby justifying the use
   of ADC-fMRI for neuro-scientific studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simultaneous EEG-fMRI provides an increasingly attractive research tool
   to investigate cognitive processes with high temporal and spatial
   resolution. However, artifacts in EEG data introduced by theMR scanner
   still remain a major obstacle. This study, employing commonly used
   artifact correction steps, shows that head motion, one overlooked major
   source of artifacts in EEG-fMRI data, can cause plausible EEG effects
   and EEG-BOLD correlations. Specifically, low-frequency EEG (<20 Hz) is
   strongly correlated with in-scanner movement. Accordingly, minor head
   motion (<0.2 mm) induces spurious effects in a twofold manner: Small
   differences in task-correlated motion elicit spurious low-frequency
   effects, and, as motion concurrently influences fMRI data, EEG-BOLD
   correlations closely match motion-fMRI correlations. We demonstrate
   these effects in a memory encoding experiment showing that obtained
   theta power (similar to 3-7 Hz) effects and channel-level theta-BOLD
   correlations reflect motion in the scanner. These findings highlight an
   important caveat that needs to be addressed by future EEG-fMRI studies.

Title = {Disrupted functional connectivity affects resting state based language
   lateralization},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {910-927},
Abstract = {Pre-operative assessment of language localization and lateralization is
   critical to preserving brain function after lesion or epileptogenic
   tissue resection. Task fMRI (t-fMRI) has been extensively and reliably
   used to this end, but resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is emerging as an
   alternative pre-operative brain mapping method that is independent of a
   patient's ability to comply with a task. We sought to evaluate if
   language lateralization obtained fromrs-fMRI can replace standard
   assessment using t-fMRI. In a group of 43 patients scheduled for
   pre-operative fMRI brain mapping and 17 healthy controls, we found that
   existing methods of determining rs-fMRI lateralization by considering
   interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity are
   inadequate compared to t-fMRI when applied to the language network. We
   determined that this was attributable to widespread but nuanced
   disturbances in the functional connectivity of the language network in
   patients. We found changes in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric
   functional connectivity that were dependent on lesion location, and
   particularly impacted patients with lesions in the left temporal lobe.
   We then tested whether a simpler measure of functional connectivity to
   the language network has a better relation to t-fMRI based language
   lateralization. Remarkably, we found that functional connectivity
   between the language network and the frontal pole, and superior frontal
   gyrus, as well as the supramarginal gyrus, significantly correlated to
   task based language lateralization indices in both patients and healthy
   controls. These findings are consistent with prior work with epilepsy
   patients, and provide a framework for evaluating language lateralization
   at rest. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {The spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   is fundamentally limited by effects from large draining veins. Here we
   describe an analysis method that provides data-driven estimates of these
   effects in task-based fMRI. The method involves fitting a
   one-dimensional manifold that characterizes variation in response
   timecourses observed in a given dataset, and then using identified early
   and late timecourses as basis functions for decomposing responses into
   components related to the microvasculature (capillaries and small
   venules) and the macrovasculature (large veins), respectively. We show
   the removal of late components substantially reduces the superficial
   cortical depth bias of fMRI responses and helps eliminate artifacts in
   cortical activity maps. This method provides insight into the origins of
   the fMRI signal and can be used to improve the spatial accuracy of fMRI.
   Temporal decomposition through manifold fitting (TDM) is an analysis
   technique that decomposes blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   responses in task-based fMRI into different components that likely
   correspond to microvasculature- and macrovasculature-driven signals.},

Title = {Age-related differences in fMRI subsequent memory effects are directly
   linked to local grey matter volume differences},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {160-164},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Episodic memory performance declines with increasing age, and older
   adults typically show reduced activation of inferior temporo-parietal
   cortices in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of
   episodic memory formation. Given the age-related cortical volume loss,
   it is conceivable that age-related reduction of memory-related fMRI
   activity may be partially attributable to reduced grey matter volume
   (GMV). We performed a voxel-wise multimodal neuroimaging analysis of
   fMRI correlates of successful memory encoding, using regional GMV as
   covariate. In a large cohort of healthy adults (106 young, 111 older),
   older adults showed reduced GMV across the entire neocortex and reduced
   encoding-related activation of inferior temporal and parieto-occipital
   cortices compared to young adults. Importantly, these reduced fMRI
   activations during successful encoding could in part be attributed to
   lower regional GMV. Our results highlight the importance of controlling
   for structural MRI differences in fMRI studies in older adults but also
   demonstrate that age-related differences in memory-related fMRI activity
   cannot be attributed to structural variability alone.},

Title = {Denoising brain networks using a fixed mathematical phase change in
   independent component analysis of magnitude-only fMRI data},
Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {17},
Pages = {5712-5728},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Brain networks extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) from
   magnitude-only fMRI data are usually denoised using various
   amplitude-based thresholds. By contrast, spatial source phase (SSP) or
   the phase information of ICA brain networks extracted from
   complex-valued fMRI data, has provided a simple yet effective way to
   perform the denoising using a fixed phase change. In this work, we
   extend the approach to magnitude-only fMRI data to avoid testing various
   amplitude thresholds for denoising magnitude maps extracted by ICA, as
   most studies do not save the complex-valued data. The main idea is to
   generate a mathematical SSP map for a magnitude map using a mapping
   framework, and the mapping framework is built using complex-valued fMRI
   data with a known SSP map. Here we leverage the fact that the phase map
   derived from phase fMRI data has similar phase information to the SSP
   map. After verifying the use of the magnitude data of complex-valued
   fMRI, this framework is generalized to work with magnitude-only data,
   allowing use of our approach even without the availability of the
   corresponding phase fMRI datasets. We test the proposed method using
   both simulated and experimental fMRI data including complex-valued data
   from University of New Mexico and magnitude-only data from Human
   Connectome Project. The results provide evidence that the mathematical
   SSP denoising with a fixed phase change is effective for denoising
   spatial maps from magnitude-only fMRI data in terms of retaining more
   BOLD-related activity and fewer unwanted voxels, compared with
   amplitude-based thresholding. The proposed method provides a unified and
   efficient SSP approach to denoise ICA brain networks in fMRI data.},

Title = {<i>ICN\_Atlas:</i> Automated description and quantification of
   functional MRI activation patterns in the framework of intrinsic
   connectivity networks},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {319-341},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Generally, the interpretation of functional MRI (fMRI) activation maps
   continues to rely on assessing their relationship to anatomical
   structures, mostly in a qualitative and often subjective way. Recently,
   the existence of persistent and stable brain networks of functional
   nature has been revealed; in particular these so-called intrinsic
   connectivity networks (ICNs) appear to link patterns of resting state
   and task-related state connectivity. These networks provide an
   opportunity of functionally-derived description and interpretation of
   fMRI maps, that may be especially important in cases where the maps are
   predominantly task-unrelated, such as studies of spontaneous brain
   activity e.g. in the case of seizure-related fMRI maps in epilepsy
   patients or sleep states. Here we present a new toolbox (ICN\_Atlas)
   aimed at facilitating the interpretation of fMRI data in the context of
   ICN. More specifically, the new methodology was designed to describe
   fMRI maps in function-oriented, objective and quantitative way using a
   set of 15 metrics conceived to quantify the degree of `engagement' of
   ICNs for any given fMRI-derived statistical map of interest. We
   demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a highly reliable
   quantification of fMRI activation maps using a publicly available
   longitudinal (test-retest) resting-state fMRI dataset. The utility of
   the ICN\_Atlas is also illustrated on a parametric task-modulation fMRI
   dataset, and on a dataset of a patient who had repeated seizures during
   resting-state fMRI, confirmed on simultaneously recorded EEG. The
   proposed ICN\_Atlas toolbox is freely available for download at
   http://icnatlas.com and at http://www.nitrc.org for researchers to use
   in their fMRI investigations.},

Title = {Electrophysiological signatures of the resting-state fMRI global signal:
   A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {311},
Pages = {351-359},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Background: The global signal of resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) constitutes an intrinsic fluctuation and
   presents an opportunity to characterize and understand the activity of
   the whole brain. Recently, evidence that the global signal contains
   neurophysiologic information has been growing, but the global signal of
   electroencephalography (EEG) has never been determined.
   New methods: We developed a new method to obtain the EEG global signal.
   The EEG global signal was reconstructed by the reference electrode
   standardization technique and represented the outer cortical
   electrophysiological activity. To investigate its relationship with the
   global signal of resting-state fMRI, a simultaneous EEG-fMRI signal was
   recorded, and this was analyzed in 24 subjects.
   Results: We found that the global signal of resting-state fMRI showed a
   positive correlation with power fluctuations of the EEG global signal in
   the gamma band (30-45 Hz) and a negative correlation in the
   low-frequency band (4-20 Hz).
   Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with the global signal of
   fMRI, the global signal of EEG provides more temporal information about
   outer cortical neural activity.
   Conclusions: These results provide new evidence for the
   electrophysiology information of the global signal of resting-state
   fMRI. More importantly, due to its high correlation with the fMRI global
   signal, the EEG global signal may serve as a new biomarker for
   neurological disorders.},

Title = {Mouse fMRI under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia: Robust contralateral
   somatosensory cortex activation in response to forepaw stimulation},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {177},
Pages = {30-44},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Mouse fMRI is critically useful to investigate functions of mouse
   models. Until now, the somatosensory-evoked responses in anesthetized
   mice are often widespread and inconsistent across reports. Here, we
   adopted a ketamine and xylazine mixture for mouse fMRI, which is
   relatively new anesthetics in fMRI experiments. Forepaw stimulation
   frequency was optimized using cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted
   optical imaging (n = 11) and blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD)
   fMRI with a gradient-echo time of 16 ms at 9.4 T, and 4 Hz stimulation
   with 0.5 ms and 0.5 mA pulses induced the highest hemodynamic response.
   For 20-s 4-Hz unilateral forepaw stimulation, localized BOLD activity
   was consistently found in the contralateral primary forelimb
   somatosensory cortex (S1FL), while no significant change was observed in
   the ipsilateral S1FL. The mean magnitude was 1.44 +/- 0.20\% SEM (n = 9)
   in the contralateral S1FL and 0.69 +/- 0.10\% in the contralateral
   thalamus. The variability of evoked fMRI responses across sessions was
   investigated by comparing with resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) functional
   connectivity (FC). Evoked responses in S1FL were correlated positively
   with rsfMRI FC between bilateral S1FL (r = 0.63 to 0.69) and negatively
   with FC between S1FL and the anterior cingulate cortex (r = -0.50 to
   -0.57), suggesting that rsfMRI FC is a good index of the evoked fMRI
   response and anesthetized animal condition. Finally, three weekly fMRI
   scans were performed in 5 mice, and localized activity was reproducibly
   observed in S1FL, with a success rate of 70-95\%. In summary, our
   developed fMRI protocol can be used for mapping functions of mouse
   models.},

Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) is used to
   investigate brain functional connectivity at rest. However, noise from
   human physiological motion is an unresolved problem associated with this
   technique. Following the unexpected previous result that group
   differences in head motion between control and patient groups caused
   group differences in the resting-state network with RS-fMRI, we reviewed
   the effects of human physiological noise caused by subject motion,
   especially motion of the head, on functional connectivity at rest
   detected with RS-fMRI. The aim of the present study was to review head
   motion artifact with RS-fMRI, individual and patient population
   differences in head motion, and correction methods for head motion
   artifact with RS-fMRI. Numerous reports have described new methods
   {[}e.g., scrubbing, regional displacement interaction (RDI)] for motion
   correction on RS-fMRI, many of which have been successful in reducing
   this negative influence. However, the influence of head motion could not
   be entirely excluded by any of these published techniques. Therefore, in
   performing RS-fMRI studies, head motion of the participants should be
   quantified with measurement technique (e.g., framewise displacement).
   Development of a more effective correction method would improve the
   accuracy of RS-fMRI analysis.},

Title = {Whole Brain fMRI Pattern Analysis Based on Tensor Neural Network},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {29297-29305},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has increasingly come to
   dominate brain mapping research, as it provides a dynamic view of brain
   matter. Feature selection or extraction methods play an important role
   in the successful application of machine learning techniques to
   classifying fMRI data by appropriately reducing the dimensionality of
   the data. While whole-brain fMRI data contains large numbers of voxels,
   the curse of dimensionality problem may limit the feature
   selection/extraction and classification performance of traditional
   methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a tensor
   neural network (TensorNet) to extract the essential and discriminative
   features from the whole-brain fMRI data. The tensor train model was
   employed to construct a simple and shallow neural network and compress a
   large number of network weight parameters. The proposed framework can
   avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, and allow us to extract
   effective patterns from the whole-brain fMRI data. Furthermore, it
   reveals a new perspective for analyzing complex fMRI data with a large
   numbers of voxels, through compressing the number of parameters in a
   neural network. Experimental results confirmed that our proposed
   classification framework based on TensorNet outperforms traditional

Title = {Correlating Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   Connectivity by Independent Component Analysis-Based Epileptogenic Zones
   with Intracranial Electroencephalogram Localized Seizure Onset Zones and
   Surgical Outcomes in Prospective Pediatric Intractable Epilepsy Study},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the agreement
   between the epileptogenic zone(s) (EZ) localization by resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and the seizure onset
   zone(s) (SOZ) identified by intracranial electroencephalogram (ic-EEG)
   using novel differentiating and ranking criteria of rs-fMRI abnormal
   independent components (ICs) in a large consecutive heterogeneous
   pediatric intractable epilepsy population without an a priori alternate
   modality informing EZ localization or prior declaration of total SOZ
   number. The EZ determination criteria were developed by using
   independent component analysis (ICA) on rs-fMRI in an initial cohort of
   350 pediatric patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery over a 3-year
   period. Subsequently, these rs-fMRI EZ criteria were applied
   prospectively to an evaluation cohort of 40 patients who underwent
   ic-EEG for SOZ identification. Thirty-seven of these patients had
   surgical resection/disconnection of the area believed to be the primary
   source of seizures. One-year seizure frequency rate was collected
   postoperatively. Among the total 40 patients evaluated, agreement
   between rs-fMRI EZ and ic-EEG SOZ was 90\% (36/40; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 0.76-0.97). Of the 37 patients who had surgical
   destruction of the area believed to be the primary source of seizures,
   27 (73\%) rs-fMRI EZ could be classified as true positives, 7 (18\%)
   false positives, and 2 (5\%) false negatives. Sensitivity of rs-fMRI EZ
   was 93\% (95\% CI 78-98\%) with a positive predictive value of 79\%
   (95\% CI, 63-89\%). In those with cryptogenic localization-related
   epilepsy, agreement between rs-fMRI EZ and ic-EEG SOZ was 89\% (8/9;
   95\% CI, 0.52-99), with no statistically significant difference between
   the agreement in the cryptogenic and symptomatic localization-related
   epilepsy subgroups. Two children with negative ic-EEG had removal of the
   rs-fMRI EZ and were seizure free 1 year postoperatively. Of the 33
   patients where at least 1 rs-fMRI EZ agreed with the ic-EEG SOZ, 24\%
   had at least 1 additional rs-fMRI EZ outside the resection area. Of
   these patients with un-resected rs-fMRI EZ, 75\% continued to have
   seizures 1 year later. Conversely, among 75\% of patients in whom
   rs-fMRI agreed with ic-EEG SOZ and had no anatomically separate rs-fMRI
   EZ, only 24\% continued to have seizures 1 year later. This relationship
   between extraneous rs-fMRI EZ and seizure outcome was statistically
   significant (p=0.01). rs-fMRI EZ surgical destruction showed significant
   association with postoperative seizure outcome. The pediatric population
   with intractable epilepsy studied prospectively provides evidence for
   use of resting-state ICA ranking criteria, to identify rs-fMRI EZ, as
   developed by the lead author (V.L.B.). This is a high yield test in this
   population, because no seizure nor particular interictal epilepiform
   activity needs to occur during the study. Thus, rs-fMRI EZ detected by
   this technique are potentially informative for epilepsy surgery
   evaluation and planning in this population. Independent of other brain
   function testing modalities, such as simultaneous EEG-fMRI or electrical
   source imaging, contextual ranking of abnormal ICs of rs-fMRI localized
   EZs correlated with the gold standard of SOZ localization, ic-EEG,
   across the broad range of pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates,
   including those with cryptogenic epilepsy.},

Title = {Functional brain network identification and fMRI augmentation using a

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {165},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recently, deep learning models have achieved superior performance for
   mapping functional brain networks from functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data compared with traditional methods. However, due to
   the lack of sufficient data and the high dimensionality of brain volume,
   deep learning models of fMRI tend to suffer from overfitting. In
   addition, existing methods rarely studied fMRI data augmentation and its
   application. To address these issues, we developed a VAE-GAN framework
   that combined a VAE (variational auto-encoder) with a GAN (generative
   adversarial net) for functional brain network identification and fMRI
   augmentation. As a generative model, the VAE-GAN models the distribution
   of fMRI so that it enables the extraction of more generalized features,
   and thus relieve the overfitting issue. The VAE-GAN is easier to train
   on fMRI than a standard GAN since it uses latent variables from VAE to
   generate fake data rather than relying on random noise that is used in a
   GAN, and it can generate higher quality of fake data than VAE since the
   discriminator can promote the training of the generator. In other words,
   the VAE-GAN inherits the advantages of VAE and GAN and avoids their
   limitations in modeling of fMRI data. Extensive experiments on task fMRI
   datasets from HCP have proved the effectiveness and superiority of the
   proposed VAE-GAN framework for identifying both temporal features and
   functional brain networks compared with existing models, and the quality
   of fake data is higher than those from VAE and GAN. The results on
   resting state fMRI of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)200
   dataset further demonstrated that the fake data generated by the VAE-GAN
   can help improve the performance of brain network modeling and ADHD
   classification.},

Title = {A Functional Data Method for Causal Dynamic Network Modeling of
   Task-Related fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) is a popular approach to investigate brain
   connections and activations when human subjects perform tasks. Because
   fMRI measures the indirect and convoluted signals of brain activities at
   a lower temporal resolution, complex differential equation modeling
   methods (e.g., Dynamic Causal Modeling) are usually employed to infer
   the neuronal processes and to fit the resulting fMRI signals. However,
   this modeling strategy is computationally expensive and remains to be
   mostly a confirmatory or hypothesis-driven approach. One major
   statistical challenge here is to infer, in a data-driven fashion, the
   underlying differential equation models from fMRI data. In this paper,
   we propose a causal dynamic network (CDN) method to estimate brain
   activations and connections simultaneously. Our method links the
   observed fMRI data with the latent neuronal states modeled by an
   ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. Using the basis function
   expansion approach in functional data analysis, we develop an
   optimization-based criterion that combines data-fitting errors and ODE
   fitting errors. We also develop and implement a block coordinate-descent
   algorithm to compute the ODE parameters efficiently. We illustrate the
   numerical advantages of our approach using data from realistic
   simulations and two task-related fMRI experiments. Compared with various
   effective connectivity methods, our method achieves higher estimation
   accuracy while improving the computational speed by from tens to
   thousands of times. Though our method is developed for task-related
   fMRI, we also demonstrate the potential applicability of our method
   (with a simple modification) to resting-state fMRI, by analyzing both
   simulated and real data from medium-sized networks.},

Title = {Statistical power or more precise insights into neuro-temporal dynamics?
   Assessing the benefits of rapid temporal sampling in fMRI},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive and widely
   used human neuroimaging method, is most known for its spatial precision.
   However, there is a growing interest in its temporal sensitivity. This
   is despite the temporal blurring of neuronal events by the blood oxygen
   level dependent (BOLD) signal, the peak of which lags neuronal firing by
   4-6 seconds. Given this, the goal of this review is to answer a
   seemingly simple question - ``What are the benefits of increased
   temporal sampling for fMRI?{''}. To answer this, we have combined fMRI
   data collected at multiple temporal scales, from 323 to 1000
   milliseconds, with a review of both historical and contemporary temporal
   literature. After a brief discussion of technological developments that
   have rekindled interest in temporal research, we next consider the
   potential statistical and methodological benefits. Most importantly, we
   explore how fast fMRI can uncover previously unobserved neuro-temporal
   dynamics - effects that are entirely missed when sampling at
   conventional 1 to 2 second rates. With the intrinsic link between space
   and time in fMRI, this temporal renaissance also delivers improvements
   in spatial precision. Far from producing only statistical gains, the
   array of benefits suggest that the continued temporal work is worth the
   effort.},

Abstract = {Memory plays an important role in human life. Memory can be divided into
   two categories, i.e., long term memory and short term memory (STM). STM
   or working memory (WM) stores information for a short span of time and
   it is used for information manipulations and fast response activities.
   WM is generally involved in the higher cognitive functions of the brain.
   Different studies have been carried out by researchers to understand the
   WM process. Most of these studies were based on neuroimaging modalities
   like fMRI, EEG, MEG etc., which use standalone processes. Each
   neuroimaging modality has some pros and cons. For example, EEG gives
   high temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution. On the other hand,
   the fMRI results have a high spatial resolution but poor temporal
   resolution. For a more in depth understanding and insight of what is
   happening inside the human brain during the WM process or during
   cognitive tasks, high spatial as well as high temporal resolution is
   desirable. Over the past decade, researchers have been working to
   combine different modalities to achieve a high spatial and temporal
   resolution at the same time. Developments of MRI compatible EEG
   equipment in recent times have enabled researchers to combine EEG-fMRI
   successfully. The research publications in simultaneous EEG-fMRI have
   been increasing tremendously. This review is focused on the WM research
   involving simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquisition and analysis. We have
   covered the simultaneous EEG-fMRI application in WM and data processing.
   Also, it adds to potential fusion methods which can be used for
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI for WM and cognitive tasks.},

Abstract = {The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is widely used for
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain function in health
   and disease. The statistical power of fMRI group studies is
   significantly hampered by high inter-subject variance due to differences
   in baseline vascular physiology. Several methods have been proposed to
   account for physiological vascularization differences between subjects
   and hence improve the sensitivity in group studies. However, these
   methods require the acquisition of additional reference scans (such as a
   full resting-state fMRI session or ASL-based calibrated BOLD). We
   present a vascular autorescaling (VasA) method, which does not require
   any additional reference scans. VasA is based on the observation that
   slow oscillations (<0.1 Hz) in arterial blood CO2 levels occur naturally
   due to changes in respiration patterns. These oscillations yield fMRI
   signal changes whose amplitudes reflect the blood oxygenation levels and
   underlying local vascularization and vascular responsivity. VasA
   estimates proxies of the amplitude of these CO2-driven oscillations
   directly from the residuals of task-related fMRI data without the need
   for reference scans. The estimates are used to scale the amplitude of
   task-related fMRI responses, to account for vascular differences. The
   VasA maps compared well to cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps and
   cerebral blood volume maps based on vascular space occupancy (VASO)
   measurements in four volunteers, speaking to the physiological vascular
   basis of VasA. VasA was validated in a wide variety of tasks in 138
   volunteers. VasA increased t-scores by up to 30\% in specific brain
   areas such as the visual cortex. The number of activated voxels was
   increased by up to 200\% in brain areas such as the orbital frontal
   cortex while still controlling the nominal false-positive rate. VasA
   fMRI outperformed previously proposed rescaling approaches based on
   resting-state fMRI data and can be readily applied to any task-related
   fMRI data set, even retrospectively. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons increasingly opt to use functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map functionally relevant brain
   re-gions for noninvasive presurgical planning and intraoperative
   neuronaviga-tion. This application requires a high degree of spatial
   accuracy, but the fMRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases as spatial
   resolution increases. In prac-tice, fMRI scans can be collected at
   multiple spatial resolutions, and it is of interest to make more
   accurate inference on brain activity by combining data with different
   resolutions. To this end, we develop a new Bayesian model to leverage
   both better anatomical precision in high resolution fMRI and higher SNR
   in standard resolution fMRI. We assign a Gaussian process prior to the
   mean intensity function and develop an efficient, scalable posterior
   compu-tation algorithm to integrate both sources of data. We draw
   posterior sam-ples using an algorithm analogous to Riemann manifold
   Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in an expanded parameter space. We illustrate
   our method in analysis of presurgical fMRI data and show in simulation
   that it infers the mean in-tensity more accurately than alternatives
   that use either the high or standard resolution fMRI data alone.},

Abstract = {Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have made
   significant progress in reconstructing perceived visual content, which
   advanced our understanding of the visual mechanism. However,
   reconstructing dynamic natural vision remains a challenge because of the
   limitation of the temporal resolution of fMRI. Here, we developed a
   novel fMRI-conditional video generative adversarial network (f-CVGAN) to
   reconstruct rapid video stimuli from evoked fMRI responses. In this
   model, we employed a generator to produce spatiotemporal reconstructions
   and employed two separate discriminators (spatial and temporal
   discriminators) for the assessment. We trained and tested the f-CVGAN on
   two publicly available video-fMRI datasets, and the model produced
   pixel-level reconstructions of 8 perceived video frames from each fMRI
   volume. Experimental results showed that the reconstructed videos were
   fMRI-related and captured important spatial and temporal information of
   the original stimuli. Moreover, we visualized the cortical importance
   map and found that the visual cortex is extensively involved in the
   reconstruction, whereas the low-level visual areas (V1/V2/V3/V4) showed
   the largest contribution. Our work suggests that slow blood oxygen
   level-dependent signals describe neural representations of the fast
   perceptual process that can be decoded in practice.},

Title = {Visual Field Reconstruction Using fMRI-Based Techniques},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI)-based techniques to assess the integrity of the
   visual field (VF).
   Methods: We combined 3T fMRI and neurocomputational models, that is,
   conventional population receptive field (pRF) mapping and a new advanced
   pRF framework ``microprobing{''} (MP), to reconstruct the VF
   representations of different cortical areas. To demonstrate their scope,
   both approaches were applied in healthy participants with simulated
   scotomas and participants with glaucoma. For the latter group we
   compared the VFs obtained with standard automated perimetry (SAP) and
   via fMRI.
   Results: Using SS, we found that the fMRI-based techniques can detect
   absolute defects in VFs that are larger than 3 degrees, in single
   participants, based on 12 minutes of fMRI scan time. Moreover, we found
   that the MP approach results in a less biased estimation of the
   preserved VF. In participants with glaucoma, we found that fMRI-based VF
   reconstruction detected VF defects with a correspondence to SAP that was
   decent, reflected by the positive correlation between fMRI-based
   sampling density and SAP-based contrast sensitivity loss (SAP) r(2) =
   0.44, P = 0.0002.This correlation was higher for MP compared to that for
   the conventional pRF analysis.
   Conclusions: The fMRI-based reconstruction of the VF enables the
   evaluation of vision loss and provides useful details on the properties
   of the visual cortex.
   Translational Relevance: The fMRI-based VF reconstruction provides an
   objective alternative to detect VF defects. It may either complement SAP
   or could provide VF information in patients unable to perform SAP.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},

Abstract = {A major drawback of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
   concerns the lack of detection accuracy of the measured signal. Although
   this limitation stems in part from the neuro-vascular nature of the fMRI
   signal, it also reflects particular methodological decisions in the fMRI
   data analysis pathway. Here we show that the signal detection accuracy
   of fMRI is affected by the specific way in which whole-brain volumes are
   created from individually acquired brain slices, and by the method of
   statistically extracting signals from the sampled data. To address these
   limitations, we propose a new framework for fMRI data analysis. The new
   framework creates whole-brain volumes from individual brain slices that
   are all acquired at the same point in time relative to a presented
   stimulus. These whole-brain volumes contain minimal temporal
   distortions, and are available at a high temporal resolution. In
   addition, statistical signal extraction occurred on the basis of a
   non-standard time point-by-time point approach. We evaluated the
   detection accuracy of the extracted signal in the standard and new
   framework with simulated and real-world fMRI data. The new slice-based
   data-analytic framework yields greatly improved signal detection
   accuracy of fMRI signals.},

Title = {Integration of resting state functional MRI into clinical practice - A
   large single institution experience},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool for
   pre-surgical evaluation of eloquent cortex. Classic task-based paradigms
   require patient participation and individual imaging sequence
   acquisitions for each functional domain that is being assessed. Resting
   state fMRI (rs-fMRI), however, enables functional localization without
   patient participation and can evaluate numerous functional domains with
   a single imaging session. To date, post-processing of this resting state
   data has been resource intensive, which limits its widespread
   application for routine clinical use. Through a novel automated
   algorithm and advanced imaging IT structure, we report the clinical
   application and the large-scale integration of rs-fMRI into routine
   neurosurgical practice. One hundred and ninety one consecutive patients
   underwent a 3T rs-fMRI, 83 of whom also underwent both motor and
   language task-based fMRI. Data were processed using a novel, automated,
   multi-layer perceptron algorithm and integrated into stereotactic
   navigation using a streamlined IT imaging pipeline. One hundred
   eighty-five studies were performed for intracranial neoplasm, 14 for
   refractory epilepsy and 33 for vascular malformations or other
   neurological disorders. Failure rate of rs-fMRI of 13\% was
   significantly better than that for task-based fMRI (38.5\%,) (p<0.001).
   In conclusion, at Washington University in St. Louis, rs-fMRI has become
   an integral part of standard imaging for neurosurgical planning. Resting
   state fMRI can be used in all patients, and due to its lower failure
   rate than task-based fMRI, it is useful for patients who are unable to
   cooperate with task-based studies.},

Title = {Enhanced control of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurophysiology with

   training and working memory practice},

Abstract = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback
   can be used to train localized, conscious regulation of blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signals. As a therapeutic technique, rt-fMRI
   neurofeedback reduces the symptoms of a variety of neurologic disorders.
   To date, few studies have investigated the use of self-regulation
   training using rt-fMRI neurofeedback to enhance cognitive performance.
   This work investigates the utility of rt-fMRI neurofeedback as a tool to
   enhance human cognition by training healthy individuals to consciously
   control activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). A
   cohort of 18 healthy participants in the experimental group underwent
   rt-fMRI neurofeedback from the left DLPFC in five training sessions
   across two weeks while 7 participants in the control group underwent
   similar training outside the MRI and without rt-fMRI neurofeedback.
   Working memory (WM) performance was evaluated on two testing days
   separated by the five rt-fMRI neurofeedback sessions using two
   computerized tests. We investigated the ability to control the BOLD
   signal across training sessions and WM performance across the two
   testing days. The group with rt-fMRI neurofeedback demonstrated a
   significant increase in the ability to self-regulate the BOLD signal in
   the left DLPFC across sessions. WM performance showed differential
   improvement between testing days one and two across the groups with the
   highest increases observed in the rt-fMRI neurofeedback group. These

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that transcranial electrical stimulation (tES)
   can be performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   The novel approach of using concurrent tES-fMRI to modulate and measure
   targeted brain activity/connectivity may provide unique insights into
   the causal interactions between the brain neural responses and
   psychiatric/neurologic signs and symptoms, and importantly, guide the
   development of new treatments. However, tES stimulation parameters to
   optimally influence the underlying brain activity may vary with respect
   to phase difference, frequency, intensity, and electrode's montage among
   individuals. Here, we propose a protocol for closed-loop tES-fMRI to
   optimize the frequency and phase difference of alternating current
   stimulation (tACS) for two nodes (frontal and parietal regions) in
   individual participants. We carefully considered the challenges in an
   online optimization of tES parameters with concurrent fMRI, specifically
   in its safety, artifact in fMRI image quality, online evaluation of the
   tES effect, and parameter optimization method, and we designed the
   protocol to run an effective study to enhance frontoparietal
   connectivity and working memory performance with the optimized tACS
   using closed-loop tES-fMRI. We provide technical details of the
   protocol, including electrode types, electrolytes, electrode montages,
   concurrent tES-fMRI hardware, online fMRI processing pipelines, and the
   optimization algorithm. We confirmed the implementation of this protocol
   worked successfully with a pilot experiment.},

Title = {Sensory evoked fMRI paradigms in awake mice},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {204},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Mouse fMRI has become increasingly popular in the small animal imaging
   field. However, compared to the more commonly used rat fMRI, it is
   challenging for mouse fMRI to obtain robust and specific functional
   imaging results. In the meantime, in other neuroscience modalities such
   as optical imaging, functional recording in the awake mice is common and
   becoming standard. Therefore, in the current study we developed
   comprehensive setups and analysis pipeline for multi-sensory fMRI
   paradigms in the awake mice. Customized setups of somatosensory
   (whisker), auditory and olfactory stimulation were developed for use in
   the cryogenic coil in the awake mouse fMRI setting. After carefully
   evaluating head motion and motion artefacts, the nuisance regression
   approach was optimized for reducing the confounding effect of motion.
   The high temporal resolution data (TR = 0.35 s) revealed fast temporal
   dynamics (time-to-peak similar to 2 s) of evoked BOLD responses in most
   brain regions. Using the derived awake mouse specific hemodynamic
   response functions, high spatial resolution data revealed robust,
   specific and consistent cortical and subcortical activations in response
   to somatosensory, auditory and olfactory stimulations, respectively.
   Overall, we present comprehensive methods for acquiring and analyzing
   sensory evoked awake mouse fMRI data. The establishment of multi-sensory
   paradigms in awake mouse fMRI provides valuable tools for examining
   spatiotemporal characteristics and neural mechanisms of BOLD signals in
   the future.},

Title = {Exploring connectivity with large-scale Granger causality on
   resting-state functional MRI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {287},
Pages = {68-79},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background: Large-scale Granger causality (IsGC) is a recently
   developed, resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity analysis
   approach that estimates multivariate voxel-resolution connectivity.
   Unlike most commonly used multivariate approaches, which establish
   coarse-resolution connectivity by aggregating voxel time-series avoiding
   an underdetermined problem, IsGC estimates voxel-resolution,
   fine-grained connectivity by incorporating an embedded dimension
   reduction.
   New method: We investigate application of IsGC on realistic fMRI
   simulations, modeling smoothing of neuronal activity by the hemodynamic
   response function and repetition time (TR), and empirical resting state
   fMRI data. Subsequently, functional subnetworks are extracted from IsGC
   connectivity measures for both datasets and validated quantitatively. We
   also provide guidelines to select IsGC free parameters.
   Results: Results indicate that IsGC reliably recovers underlying network
   structure with area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)
   of 0.93 at TR = 1.5 s for a 10-min session of fMRI simulations.
   Furthermore, subnetworks of closely interacting modules are recovered
   from the aforementioned IsGC networks. Results on empirical
   resting-state fMRI data demonstrate recovery of visual and motor cortex
   in close agreement with spatial maps obtained from (i) visuo-motor fMRI
   stimulation task-sequence (Accuracy = 0.76) and (ii) independent
   component analysis (ICA) of resting-state fMRI (Accuracy = 0.86).
   Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with conventional Granger
   causality approach (AUC = 0.75), IsGC produces better network recovery
   on fMRI simulations. Furthermore, it cannot recover functional
   subnetworks from empirical fMRI data, since quantifying voxel-resolution
   connectivity is not possible as consequence of encountering an
   underdetermined problem.
   Conclusions: Functional network recovery from fMRI data suggests that
   IsGC gives useful insight into connectivity patterns from resting-state
   fMRI at a multivariate voxel-resolution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {fMRI connectivity as a biomarker of antipsychotic treatment response: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},
Abstract = {Background: Antipsychotic drugs are the first-choice therapy for
   psychotic episodes, but antipsychotic treatment response (AP-R) is
   unpredictable and only becomes clear after weeks of therapy. A biomarker
   for AP-R is currently unavailable. We reviewed the evidence for the
   hypothesis that functional magnetic resonance imaging functional
   connectivity (fMRI-FC) is a predictor of AP-R or could serve as a
   biomarker for AP-R in psychosis.
   Method: A systematic review of longitudinal fMRI studies examining the
   predictive performance and relationship between FC and AP-R was
   performed following PRISMA guidelines. Technical and clinical aspects
   were critically assessed for the retrieved studies. We addressed three
   questions: Q1) is baseline fMRI-FC related to subsequent AP-R; Q2) is
   AP-R related to a change in fMRI-FC; and Q3) can baseline fMRI-FC
   predict subsequent AP-R?
   Results: In total, 28 articles were included. Most studies were of good
   quality. fMRI-FC analysis pipelines included seed-based-, independent
   component- / canonical correlation analysis, network-based statistics,
   and graph-theoretical approaches. We found high heterogeneity in
   methodological approaches and results. For Q1 (N = 17) and Q2 (N = 18),
   the most consistent evidence was found for FC between the striatum and
   ventral attention network as a potential biomarker of AP-R. For Q3 (N =
   9) accuracy's varied form 50 till 93\%, and prediction models were based
   on FC between various brain regions.
   Conclusion: The current fMRI-FC literature on AP-R is hampered by
   heterogeneity of methodological approaches. Methodological uniformity
   and further improvement of the reliability and validity of fMRI
   connectivity analysis is needed before fMRI-FC analysis can have a place
   in clinical applications of antipsychotic treatment.},

Abstract = {There has been increasing interest in the clinical and experimental use
   of memory functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The 2017
   American Academy of Neurology practice guidelines on the use of
   pre-surgical cognitive fMRI suggests that verbal memory fMRI could be
   used to lateralize memory functions in people with Temporal Lobe
   Epilepsy (TLE) and should be used to predict post-operative verbal
   memory outcome. There are however technical and methodological
   considerations, to optimize both the sensitivity and specificity of this
   imaging modality. Below we discuss these constraints and suggest
   recommendations to consider when designing a memory fMRI paradigm.},

Title = {Evaluation of T2-prepared blood oxygenation level dependent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging with an event-related task: Hemodynamic
   response function and reproducibility},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {T2-prepared (T2prep) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional
   MRI (fMRI) is an alternative fMRI approach developed to mitigate the
   susceptibility artifacts that are typically observed in brain regions
   near air-filled cavities, bleeding and calcification, and metallic
   objects in echo-planar-imaging (EPI) based fMRI images. Here, T2prep
   BOLD fMRI was evaluated in an event-related paradigm for the first time.
   Functional experiments were performed using gradient-echo (GRE) EPI,
   spin-echo (SE) EPI, and T2prep BOLD fMRI during an event-related visual
   task in 10 healthy human subjects. Each fMRI method was performed with a
   low (3.4 x 3.4 x 4 mm(3)) and a high (1.5 mm isotropic) spatial
   resolution on 3T and a high resolution (1.5 mm isotropic) on 7T. Robust
   activation were detected in the visual cortex with all three fMRI
   methods. In each group of fMRI scans (3T low resolution, 3T high
   resolution, and 7T high resolution), GRE EPI showed the highest signal
   change (Delta S/S), largest full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and
   longest time-to-peak (TTP) extracted from the hemodynamic response
   functions (HRF), indicating substantial signal contribution from large
   draining veins which have longer response times than microvessels. In
   contrast, T2prep BOLD showed the lowest Delta S/S, smallest FWHM, and
   shortest TTP, suggesting that T2prep BOLD may have a purer T2-weighted
   BOLD contrast that is more sensitive to microvessels compared to GRE/SE
   EPI BOLD. This trend was more obvious in fMRI scans performed with a
   lower spatial resolution on a lower field (3T with a 3.4 x 3.4 x 4 mm(3)
   voxel). Scan-rescan reproducibility in the same subjects was comparable
   among the three fMRI methods. The results from the current study are
   expected to be useful to establish T2prep BOLD as a useful alternative
   fMRI approach for event-related fMRI in brain regions with large
   susceptibility artifacts.},

Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {69-79},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: The assumption that functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) noise has constant volatility has recently been challenged by
   studies examining heteroscedasticity arising from head motion and
   physiological noise. The present study builds on this work using latest
   methods from the field of financial mathematics to model fMRI noise
   volatility.
   Methods: Multi-echo phantom and human fMRI scans were used and realised
   volatility was estimated. The Hurst parameter H is an element of (0, 1),
   which governs the roughness/irregularity of realised volatility time
   series, was estimated. Calibration of H was performed pathwise, using
   well-established neural network calibration tools.
   Results: In all experiments the volatility calibrated to values within
   the rough case, H < 0.5, and on average fMRI noise was very rough with
   0.03 < H < 0.05. Some edge effects were also observed, whereby H was
   larger near the edges of the phantoms.
   Discussion: The findings suggest that fMRI volatility is not only
   non-constant, but also substantially more irregular than a standard
   Brownian motion. Thus, further research is needed to examine the impact
   such pronounced oscillations in the volatility of fMRI noise have on
   data analyses.},

Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) helps
   characterize regional interactions that occur in the human brain at a
   resting state. Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI
   biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using
   machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that
   learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled
   training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where
   annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this
   end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL)
   framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext
   model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using
   unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform
   downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext
   model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase
   the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
   signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for
   fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner.
   This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets,
   without requiring labeled training data. This model is further
   fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection
   in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on
   three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks.
   Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several
   state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain
   diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and
   Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.},

Title = {Layer-dependent functional connectivity methods},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent methodological advances in fMRI contrast and readout strategies
   have allowed researchers to approach the mesoscopic spatial regime of
   cortical layers. This has revolutionized the ability to map cortical
   information processing within and across brain systems. However, until
   recently, most layer-fMRI studies have been confined to primary cortices
   using basic block-design tasks and macro-vascular-contaminated sequence
   contrasts. To become an established method for user-friendly
   applicability in neuroscience practice, layer-fMRI acquisition and
   analysis methods need to be extended to more flexible connectivity-based
   experiment designs; they must be able to capture subtle changes in brain
   networks of higher-order cognitive areas, and they should not be
   spatially biased with unwanted vein signals. In this article, we review
   the most pressing challenges of layer-dependent fMRI for large-scale
   neuroscientific applicability and describe recently developed
   acquisition methodologies that can resolve them. In doing so, we review
   technical tradeoffs and capabilities of modern MR-sequence approaches to
   achieve measurements that are free of locally unspecific vein signal,
   with whole-brain coverage, subsecond sampling, high resolutions, and
   with a combination of those capabilities. The presented approaches
   provide whole-brain layer-dependent connectivity data that open a new
   window to investigate brain network connections. We exemplify this by
   reviewing a number of candidate tools for connectivity analyses that
   will allow future studies to address new questions in network
   neuroscience. The considered network analysis tools include: hierarchy
   mapping, directional connectomics, source-specific connectivity mapping,
   and network sub-compartmentalization. We conclude: Whole-brain
   layer-fMRI without large-vessel contamination is applicable for human
   neuroscience and opens the door to investigate biological mechanisms
   behind any number of psychological and psychiatric phenomena, such as
   selective attention, hallucinations and delusions, and even conscious
   perception.},

Title = {Artifact Reduction in Simultaneous EEG-fMRI: A Systematic Review of
   Methods and Contemporary Usage},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a
   technique that combines temporal (largely from EEG) and spatial (largely
   from fMRI) indicators of brain dynamics. It is useful for understanding
   neuronal activity during many different event types, including
   spontaneous epileptic discharges, the activity of sleep stages, and
   activity evoked by external stimuli and decision-making tasks. However,
   EEG recorded during fMRI is subject to imaging, pulse, environment and
   motion artifact, causing noise many times greater than the neuronal
   signals of interest. Therefore, artifact removal methods are essential
   to ensure that artifacts are accurately removed, and EEG of interest is
   retained. This paper presents a systematic review of methods for
   artifact reduction in simultaneous EEG-fMRI from literature published
   since 1998, and an additional systematic review of EEG-fMRI studies
   published since 2016. The aim of the first review is to distill the
   literature into clear guidelines for use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   artifact reduction methods, and the aim of the second review is to
   determine the prevalence of artifact reduction method use in
   contemporary studies. We find that there are many published artifact
   reduction techniques available, including hardware, model based, and
   data-driven methods, but there are few studies published that adequately
   compare these methods. In contrast, recent EEG-fMRI studies show
   overwhelming use of just one or two artifact reduction methods based on
   literature published 15-20 years ago, with newer methods rarely gaining
   use outside the group that developed them. Surprisingly, almost 15\% of
   EEG-fMRI studies published since 2016 fail to adequately describe the
   methods of artifact reduction utilized. We recommend minimum standards
   for reporting artifact reduction techniques in simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   studies and suggest that more needs to be done to make new artifact
   reduction techniques more accessible for the researchers and clinicians
   using simultaneous EEG-fMRI.},

Abstract = {Since the first demonstration in the early 1990s, functional MRI (fMRI)
   has emerged as one of the most powerful, noninvasive neuroimaging tools
   to probe brain functions. Subsequently, fMRI techniques have advanced
   remarkably, enabling the acquisition of functional signals with a
   submillimeter voxel size. This innovation has opened the possibility of
   investigating subcortical neural activities with respect to the cortical
   depths or cortical columns. For this purpose, numerous previous works
   have endeavored to design suitable functional contrast mechanisms and
   dedicated imaging techniques. Depending on the choice of the functional
   contrast, functional signals can be detected with high sensitivity or
   with improved spatial specificity to the actual activation site, and the
   pertaining issues have been discussed in a number of earlier works. This
   review paper primarily aims to provide an overview of the subcortical
   fMRI techniques that allow the acquisition of functional signals with a
   submillimeter resolution. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of the
   imaging techniques will be described and compared. We also summarize
   supplementary imaging techniques that assist in the analysis of the
   subcortical brain activation for more accurate mapping with reduced
   geometric deformation. This review suggests that there is no single
   universally accepted method as the gold standard for subcortical fMRI.
   Instead, the functional contrast and the corresponding readout imaging
   technique should be carefully determined depending on the purpose of the
   study. Due to the technical limitations of current fMRI techniques, most
   subcortical fMRI studies have only targeted partial brain regions. As a
   future prospect, the spatiotemporal resolution of fMRI will be pushed to
   satisfy the community's need for a deeper understanding of whole-brain
   functions and the underlying connectivity in order to achieve the
   ultimate goal of a time-resolved and layer-specific spatial scale.

Title = {Laminar fMRI: What can the time domain tell us?},

Abstract = {The rapid developments in functional MRI (fMRI) acquisition methods and
   hardware technologies in recent years, particularly at high field (>= 7
   T), have enabled unparalleled visualization of functional detail at a
   laminar or columnar level, bringing fMRI close to the intrinsic
   resolution of brain function. These advances highlight the potential of
   high resolution fMRI to be a valuable tool to study the fundamental
   processing performed in cortical micro-circuits, and their interactions
   such as feedforward and feedback processes. Notably, because fMRI
   measures neuronal activity via hemodynamics, the ultimate resolution it
   affords depends on the spatial specificity of hemodynamics to neuronal
   activity at a detailed spatial scale, and by the evolution of this
   specificity over time. Several laminar (<= 1 mm spatial resolution) fMRI
   studies have examined spatial characteristics of the measured
   hemodynamic signals across cortical depth, in light of understanding or
   improving the spatial specificity of laminar fMRI. Few studies have
   examined temporal features of the hemodynamic response across cortical
   depth. Temporal features of the hemodynamic response offer an additional
   means to improve the specificity of fMRI, and could help target neuronal
   processes and neurovascular coupling relationships across laminae, for
   example by differences in the onset times of the response across
   cortical depth. In this review, we discuss factors that affect the
   timing of neuronal and hemodynamic responses across laminae, touching on
   the neuronal laminar organization, and focusing on the laminar vascular
   organization. We provide an overview of hemodynamics across the cortical
   vascular tree based on optical imaging studies, and review temporal
   aspects of hemodynamics that have been examined across cortical depth in
   high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI studies. Last, we discuss the limits
   and potential of high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI to study laminar
   neurovascular coupling and neuronal processes.},

Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is at present one of the
   most used methodologies for functional brain exploration, both in
   clinical and research settings. fMRI can noninvasively measure neural
   activity by using specific experimental paradigms. Often, these
   paradigms require the stimulation of the subject to perform sensorimotor
   tasks: in the past, the stimuli have been administered manually for
   investigating fundamental aspects of tactile perception and
   somatosensory processing. Nowadays, the use of mechatronic devices to
   stimulate the subject during fMRI studies is growing, also to assure
   reproducibility, control, and monitoring of task performances. For these
   reasons, researchers are interested in designing interfaces to be used
   inside the MRI environment during fMRI studies. For the design of every
   new device safety and compatibility constraints, imposed by the presence
   of high static magnetic field, switching magnetic gradients and
   radiofrequency electromagnetic pulses, must be satisfied. Moreover, it
   should be considered that functional imaging sequences are even more
   sensitive to perturbations of the magnetic field than MRI standard
   diagnostic sequences. Despite several existing devices for use in fMRI
   studies, an extensive review is still lacking. Our survey aims to
   introduce into the challenges imposed on the development of
   fMRI-compatible devices. The current state of the art of compatible
   devices in fMRI will be presented, pointing out the functionalities and
   peculiarities of various kinds of device. A particular emphasis will be
   placed on the tests for the evaluation of fMRI compatibility. This
   review will be useful both for designers of devices to be used in fMRI
   studies and for neuroscientists that are having to design fMRI
   experimental paradigm, and therefore require an overview of existing
   instruments, but also a knowledge of the benefits and criticism arising
   from their use.},

Title = {Localization of cortical primary motor area of the hand using navigated
   transcranial magnetic stimulation, BOLD and arterial spin labeling fMRI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {273},
Pages = {138-148},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Background: Although the relationship between neuronavigated
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely studied in motor mapping, it is
   unknown how the motor response type or the choice of motor task affect
   this relationship.
   New method: Centers of gravity (CoGs) and response maxima were measured
   with blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling
   (ASL) fMRI during motor tasks against nTMS CoGs and response maxima,
   which were mapped with motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and silent periods
   (SPs).
   Results: No differences in motor representations (CoGs and response
   maxima) were observed in lateral medial direction (p = 0.265). fMRI
   methods localized the motor representation more posterior than nTMS (p <
   0.001). This was not affected by the BOLD fMRI motor task (p >0.999) nor
   nTMS response type (p > 0.999). ASL fMRI maxima did not differ from the
   nTMS nor BOLD fMRI CoGs (p >= 0.070), but the ASL CoG was deeper in
   comparison to other methods (p <= 0.042). The BOLD fMRI motor task did
   not influence the depth of the motor representation (p >= 0.745). The
   median Euclidean distances between the nTMS and fMRI motor
   representations varied between 7.7 mm and 14.5 mm and did not differ
   between the methods (F <= 1.23, p >= 0.318).
   Comparison with existing methods: The relationship between fMRI and nTMS
   mapped excitatory (MEP) and inhibitory (SP) responses, and whether the
   choice of motor task affects this relationship, have not been studied
   before.
   Conclusions: The congruence between fMRI and nTMS is good. The choice of
   nTMS motor response type nor BOLD fMRI motor task had no effect on this
   relationship. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The desirable spatial specificity of spin echo (SE) fMRI cannot be
   efficiently utilized in high fields due to specific absorption rate
   (SAR) and B1 inhomogeneity problems. Consequently, S2-SSFP fMRI has been
   suggested as an alternative to mitigate these problems. Nevertheless, no
   accurate analysis has been performed thus far to evaluate spatial
   specificity of this technique. To study spatial specificity, we
   performed Monte Carlo simulations for evaluating the micro-vasculature
   contribution in functional contrast along with vessel size sensitivity
   estimations for a range of relevant imaging parameters. Results showed a
   spatial specificity at the level of SE fMRI. Simulations further
   revealed that similar to SE fMRI, an effective echo time (TE) close to
   the tissue T2 maximizes the microvasculature contribution in the
   obtained contrast. The amount of this contribution, however, showed a
   slight decrease at ultra -high fields compared to SE fMRI. As for vessel
   size sensitivity, simulations presented a pattern for S2-SSFP similar to
   SE fMRI but with a minor shift toward larger vessels. These results are
   in general agreement with reported experimental studies. Our findings
   also suggest that the effect of older pathways, rather than primary SE
   pathway, might be responsible for the observed discrepancies between S2
   and SE. Based on this study, provided that optimum experimental
   parameters are used, S2, with its desirable micro-vasculature
   contribution and high sensitivity to small vessels, is a promising low
   SAR approach to replace SE fMRI in high field. (C) 2016 Published by

Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2018},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) are two of the fundamental noninvasive methods for identifying
   brain activity. Multimodal methods have sought to combine the high
   temporal resolution of EEG with the spatial precision of fMRI, but the
   complexity of this approach is currently in need of improvement. The
   protocol presented here describes the recently developed spatiotemporal
   fMRI-constrained EEG source imaging method, which seeks to rectify
   source biases and improve EEG-fMRI source localization through the
   dynamic recruitment of fMRI sub-regions. The process begins with the
   collection of multimodal data from concurrent EEG and fMRI scans, the
   generation of 3D cortical models, and independent EEG and fMRI
   processing. The processed fMRI activation maps are then split into
   multiple priors, according to their location and surrounding area. These
   are taken as priors in a two-level hierarchical Bayesian algorithm for
   EEG source localization. For each window of interest (defined by the
   operator), specific segments of the fMRI activation map will be
   identified as active to optimize a parameter known as model evidence.
   These will be used as soft constraints on the identified cortical
   activity, increasing the specificity of the multimodal imaging method by
   reducing cross-talk and avoiding erroneous activity in other
   conditionally active fMRI regions. The method generates cortical maps of
   activity and time-courses, which may be taken as final results, or used

   not find EEG-invisible sources), it is broadly compatible with most
   major processing software, and is suitable for most neuroimaging

Title = {Ten Key Insights into the Use of Spinal Cord fMRI},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A comprehensive review of the literature-to-date on functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) of the spinal cord is presented. Spinal fMRI
   has been shown, over more than two decades of work, to be a reliable
   tool for detecting neural activity. We discuss 10 key points regarding
   the history, development, methods, and applications of spinal fMRI.
   Animal models have served a key purpose for the development of spinal
   fMRI protocols and for experimental spinal cord injury studies.
   Applications of spinal fMRI span from animal models across healthy and
   patient populations in humans using both task-based and resting-state
   paradigms. The literature also demonstrates clear trends in study design
   and acquisition methods, as the majority of studies follow a task-based,
   block design paradigm, and utilize variations of single-shot fast
   spin-echo imaging methods. We, therefore, discuss the similarities and
   differences of these to resting-state fMRI and gradient-echo EPI
   protocols. Although it is newly emerging, complex connectivity and
   network analysis is not only possible, but has also been shown to be
   reliable and reproducible in the spinal cord for both task-based and
   resting-state studies. Despite the technical challenges associated with
   spinal fMRI, this review identifies reliable solutions that have been
   developed to overcome these challenges.},

Title = {Heterogeneous motor BOLD-fMRI responses in brain areas exhibiting
   negative BOLD cerebrovascular reactivity indicate that steal phenomenon
   does not always result from exhausted cerebrovascular reserve capacity},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {124-130},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Introduction: Brain areas exhibiting negative blood oxygenation-level
   dependent cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) responses to carbon
   dioxide (CO2) are thought to suffer from a completely exhausted
   autoregulatory cerebrovascular reserve capacity and exhibit vascular
   steal phenomenon. If this assumption is correct, the presence of
   vascular steal phenomenon should subsequently result in an equal
   negative fMRI signal response during a motor-task based BOLD-fMRI study
   (increase in metabolism without an increase in cerebral blood flow due
   to exhausted reserve capacity) in otherwise functional brain tissue. To
   investigate this premise, the aim of this study was to further
   investigate motor-task based BOLD-fMRI signal responses in brain areas
   exhibiting negative BOLD-CVR. Material and methods: Seventy-one datasets
   of patients with cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease without motor
   defects, who underwent a CO2-calibrated motor task-based BOLD-fMRI study
   with a fingertapping paradigm and a subsequent BOLD-CVR study with a
   precisely controlled CO2-challenge during the same MRI examination, were
   included. We compared BOLD-fMRI signal responses in the bilateral pre-
   and postcentral gyri - i. e. Region of Interest (ROI) with the
   corresponding BOLD-CVR in this ROI. The ROI was determined using a
   second level group analysis of the BOLD-fMRI task study of 42 healthy
   individuals undergoing the same study protocol. Results: An overall
   decrease in BOLD-CVR was associated with a decrease in BOLD-fMRI signal
   response within the ROI. For patients exhibiting negative BOLD-CVR, we
   found both positive and negative motor-task based BOLD-fMRI signal
   responses. Conclusion: We show that the presence of negative BOLD-CVR
   responses to CO2 is associated with heterogeneous motor task-based
   BOLD-fMRI signal responses, where some patients show -more presumed-
   negative BOLD-fMRI signal responses, while other patient showed positive
   BOLD-fMRI signal responses. This finding may indicate that the
   autoregulatory vasodilatory reserve capacity does not always need to be
   completely exhausted for vascular steal phenomenon to occur.},

Abstract = {Despite extensive efforts to identify interhemispheric functional
   connectivity (FC) with resting-state (rs-) fMRI, correlated
   low-frequency rs-fMRI signal fluctuation across homotopic cortices
   originates from multiple sources. It remains challenging to
   differentiate circuit-specific FC from global regulation. Here, we
   developed a bilateral line-scanning fMRI method to detect
   laminar-specific rs-fMRI signals from homologous forepaw somatosensory
   cortices with high spatial and temporal resolution in rat brains. Based
   on spectral coherence analysis, two distinct bilateral fluctuation
   spectral features were identified: ultra-slow fluctuation (<0.04 Hz)
   across all cortical laminae versus Layer (L) 2/3-specific evoked BOLD at
   0.05 Hz based on 4 s on/16 s off block design and resting-state
   fluctuations at 0.08-0.1 Hz. Based on the measurements of evoked BOLD
   signal at corpus callosum (CC), this L2/3-specific 0.05 Hz signal is
   likely associated with neuronal circuit-specific activity driven by the
   callosal projection, which dampened ultra-slow oscillation less than
   0.04 Hz. Also, the rs-fMRI power variability clustering analysis showed
   that the appearance of L2/3-specific 0.08-0.1 Hz signal fluctuation is
   independent of the ultra-slow oscillation across different trials. Thus,
   distinct laminar-specific bilateral FC patterns at different frequency
   ranges can be identified by the bilateral line-scanning fMRI method.},

Abstract = {Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a
   unique and noninvasive method for epilepsy presurgical evaluation. When
   selecting voxels by null-hypothesis tests, the conventional analysis may
   overestimate fMRI response amplitudes related to interictal epileptic
   discharges (IEDs), especially when IEDs are rare. We aimed to estimate
   fMRI response amplitudes represented by blood oxygen level dependent
   (BOLD) percentage changes related to IEDs using a hierarchical model. It
   involves the local and distributed hemodynamic response homogeneity to
   regularize estimations. Bayesian inference was applied to fit the model.
   Eighty-two epilepsy patients who underwent EEG-fMRI and subsequent
   surgery were included in this study. A conventional voxel-wise general
   linear model was compared to the hierarchical model on estimated fMRI
   response amplitudes and on the concordance between the highest response
   cluster and the surgical cavity. The voxel-wise model overestimated fMRI
   responses compared to the hierarchical model, evidenced by a practically
   and statistically significant difference between the estimated BOLD
   percentage changes. Only the hierarchical model differentiated brief and
   long-lasting IEDs with significantly different BOLD percentage changes.
   Overall, the hierarchical model outperformed the voxel-wise model on
   presurgical evaluation, measured by higher prediction performance. When
   compared with a previous study, the hierarchical model showed higher
   performance metric values, but the same or lower sensitivity. Our
   results demonstrated the capability of the hierarchical model of
   providing more physiologically reasonable and more accurate estimations
   of fMRI response amplitudes induced by IEDs. To enhance the sensitivity
   of EEG-fMRI for presurgical evaluation, it may be necessary to
   incorporate more appropriate spatial priors and bespoke decision
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Brain lesions in language-related cortical areas remain a challenge in
   the clinical routine. In recent years, the resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI)
   was shown to be a feasible method for preoperative language assessment.
   The aim of this study was to examine whether language-related
   resting-state components, which have been obtained using a data-driven
   independent-component-based identification algorithm, can be supportive
   in determining language dominance in the left or right hemisphere.
   Twenty patients suffering from brain lesions close to supposed
   language-relevant cortical areas were included. RS-fMRI and task-based
   (TB-fMRI) were performed for the purpose of preoperative language
   assessment. TB-fMRI included a verb generation task with an appropriate
   control condition (a syllable switching task) to decompose
   language-critical and language-supportive processes. Subsequently, the
   best fitting ICA component for the resting-state language network (RSLN)
   referential to general linear models (GLMs) of the TB-fMRI (including
   models with and without linguistic control conditions) was identified
   using an algorithm based on the Dice index. Thereby, the RSLNs
   associated with GLMs using a linguistic control condition led to
   significantly higher laterality indices than GLM baseline contrasts. LIs
   derived from GLM contrasts with and without control conditions alone did
   not differ significantly. In general, the results suggest that
   determining language dominance in the human brain is feasible both with
   TB-fMRI and RS-fMRI, and in particular, the combination of both
   approaches yields a higher specificity in preoperative language
   assessment. Moreover, we can conclude that the choice of the language
   mapping paradigm is crucial for the mentioned benefits.},

Title = {Correlated Disruption of Resting-State fMRI, LFP, and Spike Connectivity

Abstract = {This study aims to understand how functional connectivity (FC) between
   areas 3b and S2 alters following input deprivation and the neuronal
   basis of disrupted FC of resting-state fMRI signals. We combined
   submillimeter fMRI with microelectrode recordings to localize the
   deafferented digit regions in areas 3b and S2 by mapping tactile
   stimulus-evoked fMRI activations before and after cervical dorsal column
   lesion in each male monkey. An average afferent disruption of 97\%
   significantly reduced fMRI, local field potential (LFP), and spike
   responses to stimuli in both areas. Analysis of resting-state fMRI
   signal correlation, LFP coherence, and spike cross-correlation revealed
   significantly reduced functional connectivity between deafferented areas
   3b and S2. The degrees of reductions in stimulus responsiveness and FC
   after deafferentation differed across fMRI, LFP, and spiking signals.
   The reduction of FC was much weaker than that of stimulus-evoked
   responses. Whereas the largest stimulus-evoked signal drop (similar to
   80\%) was observed in LFP signals, the greatest FC reduction was
   detected in the spiking activity (similar to 30\%). fMRI signals showed
   mild reductions in stimulus responsiveness (similar to 25\%) and FC
   (similar to 20\%). The overall deafferentation-induced changes were
   quite similar in areas 3b and S2 across signals. Here we demonstrated
   that FC strength between areas 3b and S2 was much weakened by dorsal
   column lesion, and stimulus response reduction and FC disruption in fMRI
   covary with those of LFP and spiking signals in deafferented areas 3b
   and S2. These findings have important implications for fMRI studies
   aiming to probe FC alterations in pathological conditions involving
   deafferentation in humans.},

Abstract = {Accurate identification of brain function is necessary to understand the
   neurobiology of cognitive ageing, and thereby promote well-being across
   the lifespan. A common tool used to investigate neurocognitive ageing is
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, although fMRI
   data are often interpreted in terms of neuronal activity, the blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured by fMRI includes
   contributions of both vascular and neuronal factors, which change
   differentially with age. While some studies investigate vascular ageing
   factors, the results of these studies are not well known within the
   field of neurocognitive ageing and therefore vascular confounds in
   neurocognitive fMRI studies are common. Despite over 10 000 BOLD-fMRI
   papers on ageing, fewer than 20 have applied techniques to correct for
   vascular effects. However, neurovascular ageing is not only a confound
   in fMRI, but an important feature in its own right, to be assessed
   alongside measures of neuronal ageing. We review current approaches to
   dissociate neuronal and vascular components of BOLD-fMRI of regional
   activity and functional connectivity. We highlight emerging evidence
   that vascular mechanisms in the brain do not simply control blood flow
   to support the metabolic needs of neurons, but form complex
   neurovascular interactions that influence neuronal function in health
   and disease. This article is part of the theme issue `Key relationships
   between non-invasive functional neuroimaging and the underlying neuronal
   activity'.},

Title = {Resting-state functional MRI of the visual system for characterization

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Optic neuropathy refers to disease of the optic nerve and can result in
   loss of visual acuity and/or visual field defects. Combining findings
   from multiple fMRI modalities can offer valuable information for
   characterizing and managing optic neuropathies. In this article, we
   review a subset of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (RS-fMRI) studies of optic neuropathies. We consider glaucoma, acute
   optic neuritis (ON), discuss traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), and
   explore consistency between findings from RS and visually driven fMRI
   studies. Consistent with visually driven studies, glaucoma studies at
   rest also indicated reduced activation in the visual cortex and dorsal
   visual stream. RS-fMRI further reported varying levels of functional
   connectivity in the ventral stream depending on disease severity. ON
   patients show alterations within the visual cortex in both fMRI
   techniques. Particularly, higher-than-normal RS activity is observed in
   the acute phase and decreases as the disease progresses. A similar
   pattern is observed in the visual cortex of TON-like, open globe injury
   (OGI), patients. Additionally, visually driven and RS-fMRI studies of ON
   patients show recovery of brain activity in the visual cortex. RS-fMRI
   suggests recovery of signals in higher-tier visual areas MT and LOC as
   well. Finally, RS-fMRI has not yet been applied to TON, although
   reviewing OGI studies suggests that it is feasible. Future RS-fMRI
   studies of optic neuropathies could prioritize studying the fine scale
   RS activity of brain areas that visually driven studies have identified.
   We suggest that a more systematic longitudinal comparison of optic
   neuropathies with advanced fMRI would provide improved diagnostic and
   prognostic information.},

Abstract = {Background: Sleep deprivation (SD) is considered an important activation
   test to facilitate the visualization of electroencephalogram (EEG)
   epileptic abnormalities, in order to perform a correct diagnosis.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the local functional
   activity in healthy controls (HC) subjects and left mesial temporal lobe
   epilepsy-hippocampal sclerosis patients, after a SD, by using functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and EEG.
   Materials and methods: We enrolled 22 healthy controls and 34 patients
   with a diagnosis of left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy-hippocampal
   sclerosis. Each participant underwent two examinations separately: an
   fMRI study using 3 T MRI to detect spontaneous activity during the
   RS-fMRI and an EEG.
   Results: The SD-EEG results showed the presence of epileptiform
   discharges predominantly in left fronto-centro-temporal areas. fMRI
   findings if compared to HC showed an increase of functional activity in
   some areas.
   Discussion: We showed that SD-EEG study confirmed a high specificity to
   assess a specific diagnosis. Therefore, the decrease of activity
   observed in DMN could be explain by a different amount of sleep/awake
   time during fMRI recording in the two groups or the interictal activity
   during fMRI acquisition. Our study highlighted alterated functional
   activity in SD cortical areas of epileptic patients if compared to HC.

Title = {A dictionary learning algorithm for multi-subject fMRI analysis based on
   a hybrid concatenation scheme},
Journal = {DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {249-260},

Abstract = {Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from
   multiple subjects is at the heart of many medical imaging studies, and
   recently, the approaches based on dictionary learning (DL) are noted as
   promising solutions to the problem. However, the DL-based methods for
   fMRI analysis proposed to date do not naturally extend to multi-subject
   analysis. In this paper, we propose a DL algorithm for multi subject
   fMRI data analysis which is derived using a hybrid (temporal and
   spatial) concatenation scheme. It differs from existing DL methods in
   both its sparse coding and dictionary update stages. It has the
   advantage of learning a dictionary common to all subjects as well as a
   set of subject-specific dictionaries, as a result, it is able to
   generate both group-level spatial activation maps as well as group-level
   temporal dynamics, which are particularly attractive for task-based fMRI
   studies. In addition, by simultaneously learning multiple sub-specific
   dictionaries, it also provides us with unique sub-specific features as
   well. Performance of the proposed DL method is illustrated using
   simulated and real fMRI datasets. The results show that it can
   successfully extract common as well as sub-specific latent components.

Abstract = {Objective To assess longitudinal patterns of brain functional MRI (fMRI)
   activity in a case of prodromal semantic variant of a primary
   progressive aphasia (svPPA). Methods Clinical, cognitive and
   neuroimaging data (T1-weighted and task-based fMRI during silent naming
   {[}SN] and object knowledge {[}OK]) were obtained at baseline, month 8
   and month 16 from a 49-year-old lady presenting with anomias and
   evolving to overt svPPA in 8 months. Results At baseline, the patient
   showed isolated anomias and mild left anterior temporal pole atrophy.
   During SN-fMRI, she showed bilateral temporal and left inferior frontal
   gyri (iFG) activations. During OK-fMRI, we observed normal performance
   and the recruitment of bilateral posterior hippocampi, iFG and left
   middle orbitofrontal gyrus (mOFG). At month 8, the patient received a
   diagnosis of svPPA and showed isolated right iFG activity during
   SN-fMRI, and a borderline performance during OK-fMRI together with a
   disappearance of mOFG recruitment. At the last visit (after 7-month
   language therapy), the patient showed a stabilization of naming
   disturbances, and, compared to previous visits, an increased left iFG
   recruitment during SN-fMRI. During OK-fMRI, she performed abnormally and
   did not show the activity of mOFG and iFG. Across all visits, brain
   atrophy remained stable. Conclusions This case report showed
   longitudinal fMRI patterns during semantic-related tasks from prodromal
   to overt svPPA. Frontal brain recruitment may represent a compensatory
   mechanism in patients with early svPPA, which is likely to be reinforced
   by language-therapy. Brain fMRI is more sensitive compared with
   structural MRI to detect progressive brain changes associated with
   disease and treatment.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {The interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies of brain activity is often hampered by the presence of
   brain-wide signal variations that may arise from a variety of neuronal
   and non-neuronal sources. Recent work suggests a contribution from the
   sympathetic vascular innervation, which may affect the fMRI signal
   through its putative and poorly understood role in cerebral blood flow
   (CBF) regulation. By analyzing fMRI and (electro-) physiological signals
   concurrently acquired during sleep, we found that widespread fMRI signal
   changes often co-occur with electroencephalography (EEG) K-complexes,
   signatures of sub-cortical arousal, and episodic drops in finger skin
   vascular tone; phenomena that have been associated with intermittent
   sympathetic activity. These findings support the notion that the
   extrinsic sympathetic innervation of the cerebral vasculature
   contributes to CBF regulation and the fMRI signal. Accounting for this
   mechanism could help separate systemic from local signal contributions
   and improve interpretation of fMRI studies.},

Title = {MEG current source reconstruction using a meta-analysis fMRI prior},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {236},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers a unique way to noninvasively
   investigate millisecond-order cortical activities by mapping sensor
   signals (magnetic fields outside the head) to cortical current sources
   using current source reconstruction methods. Current source
   reconstruction is defined as an ill-posed inverse problem, since the
   number of sensors is less than the number of current sources. One
   powerful approach to solving this problem is to use functional MRI
   (fMRI) data as a spatial constraint, although it boosts the cost of
   measurement and the burden on subjects. Here, we show how to use the
   meta-analysis fMRI data synthesized from thousands of papers instead of
   the individually recorded fMRI data. To mitigate the differences between
   the meta-analysis and individual data, the former are imported as prior
   information of the hierarchical Bayesian estimation. Using realistic
   simulations, we found out the performance of current source
   reconstruction using meta-analysis fMRI data to be better than that
   using low-quality individual fMRI data and conventional methods. By
   applying experimental data of a face recognition task, we qualitatively
   confirmed that group analysis results using the meta-analysis fMRI data
   showed a tendency similar to the results using the individual fMRI data.
   Our results indicate that the use of meta-analysis fMRI data improves
   current source reconstruction without additional measurement costs. We
   assume the proposed method would have greater effect for modalities with
   lower measurement costs, such as optically pumped magnetometers.},

Title = {A Set of Functional Brain Networks for the Comprehensive Evaluation of
   Human Characteristics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Many human characteristics must be evaluated to comprehensively
   understand an individual, and measurements of the corresponding
   cognition/behavior are required. Brain imaging by functional MRI (fMRI)
   has been widely used to examine brain function related to human
   cognition/behavior. However, few aspects of cognition/behavior of
   individuals or experimental groups can be examined through task-based
   fMRI. Recently, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals have been shown to
   represent functional infrastructure in the brain that is highly involved
   in processing information related to cognition/behavior. Using rs-fMRI
   may allow diverse information about the brain through a single MRI scan
   to be obtained, as rs-fMRI does not require stimulus tasks. In this
   study, we attempted to identify a set of functional networks
   representing cognition/behavior that are related to a wide variety of
   human characteristics and to evaluate these characteristics using
   rs-fMRI data. If possible, these findings would support the potential of
   rs-fMRI to provide diverse information about the brain. We used
   resting-state fMRI and a set of 130 psychometric parameters that cover
   most human characteristics, including those related to intelligence and
   emotional quotients and social ability/skill. We identified 163 brain
   regions by VBM analysis using regression analysis with 130 psychometric
   parameters. Next, using a 163 x 163 correlation matrix, we identified
   functional networks related to 111 of the 130 psychometric parameters.
   Finally, we made an 8-class support vector machine classifiers
   corresponding to these 111 functional networks. Our results demonstrate
   that rs-fMRI signals contain intrinsic information about brain function
   related to cognition/behaviors and that this set of 111
   networks/classifiers can be used to comprehensively evaluate human
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {We describe five patients with frontal lobe epilepsy who underwent
   electrocortical stimulation (ES) for language localization and language
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to epilepsy surgery.
   Six months after surgery, three patients suffered from a drop of verbal
   fluency. In all of them, frontal areas with presurgical language fMRI
   activity were resected. Our results suggest that resection in regions of
   areas with presurgical fMRI activation is not without risk for a
   postsurgical loss of function, even when ES results were negative for
   language function in these areas. Using fMRI activations might be
   specifically helpful to plan the resection when ES delivered
   inconclusive results.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an fMRI signal analysis methodology using geometric
   mean curve decomposition (GMCD) and mutual information-based voxel
   selection framework. Previously, the fMRI signal analysis has been
   conducted using empirical mean curve decomposition (EMCD) model and
   voxel selection on raw fMRI signal. The erstwhile methodology loses
   frequency component, while the latter methodology suffers from signal
   redundancy. Both challenges are addressed by our methodology in which
   the frequency component is considered by decomposing the raw fMRI signal
   using geometric mean rather than arithmetic mean and the voxels are
   selected from EMCD signal using GMCD components, rather than raw fMRI
   signal. The proposed methodologies are adopted for predicting the neural
   response. Experimentations are conducted in the openly available fMRI
   data of six subjects, and comparisons are made with existing
   decomposition models and voxel selection frameworks. Subsequently, the
   effect of degree of selected voxels and the selection constraints are
   analyzed. The comparative results and the analysis demonstrate the
   superiority and the reliability of the proposed methodology.},

Title = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging for

Abstract = {Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion
   tensor imaging-derived tractography (DTI-t) contribute to the
   localization of language areas, but their accuracy remains
   controversial. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic
   performance of preoperative fMRI and DTI-t obtained with a simultaneous
   multi-slice technique using intraoperative direct cortical stimulation
   (DCS) or corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP) as reference standards.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 26 patients
   (23-74 years; male:female, 13:13) with tumors in the vicinity of Broca's
   area who underwent preoperative fMRI and DTI-t. A site-by-site
   comparison between preoperative (fMRI and DTI-t) and intraoperative
   language mapping (DCS or CCEP) was performed for 226 cortical sites to
   calculate the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI and DTI-t for mapping
   Broca's areas. For sites with positive signals on fMRI or DTI-t, the
   true-positive rate (TPR) was calculated based on the concordance and
   discordance between fMRI and DTI-t.
   Results: Among 226 cortical sites, DCS was performed in 100 sites and
   CCEP was performed in 166 sites. The specificities of fMRI and DTI-t
   ranged from 72.4\% (63/87) to 96.8\% (122/126), respectively. The
   sensitivities of fMRI (except for verb generation) and DTI-t were 69.2\%
   (9/13) to 92.3\% (12/13) with DCS as the reference standard, and 40.0\%
   (16/40) or lower with CCEP as the reference standard. For sites with
   preoperative fMRI or DTI-t positivity (n = 82), the TPR was high when
   fMRI and DTI-t were concordant (81.2\% and 100\% using DCS and CCEP,
   respectively, as the reference standards) and low when fMRI and DTI-t
   were discordant (<= 24.2\%).
   Conclusion: fMRI and DTI-t are sensitive and specific for mapping
   Broca's area compared with DCS and specific but insensitive compared
   with CCEP. A site with a positive signal on both fMRI and DTI-t
   represents a high probability of being an essential language area.},

Title = {Decoding Task-Related Functional Brain Imaging Data to Identify
   Developmental Disorders: The Case of Congenital Amusia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Machine learning classification techniques are frequently applied to
   structural and resting-state fMRI data to identify brain-based
   biomarkers for developmental disorders. However, task-related fMRI has
   rarely been used as a diagnostic tool. Here, we used structural MRI,
   resting-state connectivity and task-based fMRI data to detect congenital
   amusia, a pitch-specific developmental disorder. All approaches
   discriminated amusics from controls in meaningful brain networks at
   similar levels of accuracy. Interestingly, the classifier outcome was
   specific to deficit-related neural circuits, as the group classification
   failed for fMRI data acquired during a verbal task for which amusics
   were unimpaired. Most importantly, classifier outputs of task-related
   fMRI data predicted individual behavioral performance on an independent
   pitch-based task, while this relationship was not observed for
   structural or resting-state data. These results suggest that
   task-related imaging data can potentially be used as a powerful
   diagnostic tool to identify developmental disorders as they allow for
   the prediction of symptom severity.},

Abstract = {Awake rodent fMRI is becoming a promising non-invasive brain imaging
   module when investigating large-scale brain function given behavioral
   tasks. Previous studies have either applied sedatives during scanning or
   pre-treatment of anesthetics, e.g., isoflurane, to reduce the motion of
   animals, which could confound the brain function of ``awake{''} states
   in rodents. Here, we have established a long training awake mouse
   fMRI-pupillometry paradigm/setup without the initial use of anesthesia.
   To validate the awake mouse fMRI platform, evoked BOLD-fMRI was
   performed to identify brain activation in the visual cortex, dorsal
   lateral geniculate nuclei, and superior colliculus. Furthermore, pupil
   signal fluctuation was investigated during scanning, showing a less
   dilated pupil after 5-8 weeks of intermittent training. Thus, using the
   awake mouse fMRI with real-time pupillometry provides a longitudinal
   functional mapping tool to study fully conscious mice.},

   Epilepsy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Pharmacological treatment with antiepileptic medications (AEDs) in
   epilepsy is associated with a variety of neurocognitive side effects.
   However, the mechanisms underlying these side effects, and why certain
   brain anatomies are more affected still remain poorly understood.
   Advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods, such as
   pharmaco-fMRI, can investigate medication-related effects on brain
   activities using task and resting state fMRI and showing reproducible
   activation and deactivation patterns. This methodological approach has
   been used successfully to complement neuropsychological studies of AEDs.
   Here we review pharmaco-fMRI studies in people with epilepsy targeting
   the most-widely prescribed AEDs. Pharmco-fMRI has advanced our
   understanding of the impact of AEDs on specific brain networks and thus
   may provide potential biomarkers to move beyond the current ``trial and
   error{''} approach when commencing anti-epileptic medication.},

Title = {A Bayesian Variable Selection Approach Yields Improved Detection of
   Brain Activation From Complex-Valued fMRI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {113},

Pages = {1395-1410},
Abstract = {Voxel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time courses are
   complex-valued signals giving rise to magnitude and phase data.
   Nevertheless, most studies use only the magnitude signals and thus
   discard half of the data that could potentially contain important
   information. Methods that make use of complex-valued fMRI (CV-fMRI) data
   have been shown to lead to superior power in detecting active voxels
   when compared to magnitude-only methods, particularly for small
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We present a new Bayesian variable
   selection approach for detecting brain activation at the voxel level
   from CV-fMRI data. We develop models with complex-valued spike-and-slab
   priors on the activation parameters that are able to combine the
   magnitude and phase information. We present a complex-valued EM variable
   selection algorithm that leads to fast detection at the voxel level in
   CV-fMRI slices and also consider full posterior inference via Markov
   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Model performance is illustrated through
   extensive simulation studies, including the analysis of physically based
   simulated CV-fMRI slices. Finally, we use the complex-valued Bayesian
   approach to detect active voxels in human CV-fMRI from a healthy
   individual who performed unilateral finger tapping in a designed
   experiment. The proposed approach leads to improved detection of
   activation in the expected motor-related brain regions and produces
   fewer false positive results than other methods for CV-fMRI.

Abstract = {The spatial resolution of fMRI is relatively poor and improvements are
   needed to indicate more specific locations for functional activities.
   Here, we propose a novel scheme, called Static T2{*}WI-based
   Subject-Specific Super Resolution fMRI (STSS-SRfMRI), to enhance the
   functional resolution, or ability to discriminate spatially adjacent but
   functionally different responses, of fMRI. The scheme is based on
   super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SRGAN) that utilize a
   T2{*}-weighted image (T2{*}WI) dataset as a training reference. The
   efficacy of the scheme was evaluated through comparison with the
   activation maps obtained from the raw unpreprocessed functional data
   (raw fMRI). MRI images were acquired from 30 healthy volunteers using a
   3 Tesla scanner. The modified SRGAN reconstructs a high-resolution image
   series from the original low-resolution fMRI data. For quantitative
   comparison, several metrics were calculated for both the STSS-SRfMRI and
   the raw fMRI activation maps. The ability to distinguish between two
   different finger-tapping tasks was significantly higher {[}p = 0.00466]
   for the reconstructed STSS-SRfMRI images than for the raw fMRI images.
   The results indicate that the functional resolution of the STSS-SRfMRI
   scheme is superior, which suggests that the scheme is a potential
   solution to realizing higher functional resolution in fMRI images
   obtained using 3T MRI.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used extensively
   to understand the brain function of a wide range of neurological and
   psychiatric disorders. When applied to animal studies, anesthesia is
   always used to reduce the movement of the animal and also reduce the
   impacts on the results of fMRI. Several awake models have been proposed
   by applying physical animal movement restrictions. However, restraining
   devices were designed for individual subject which limits the promotion
   of fMRI in awake animals. Here, a clinical muscle relaxant rocuronium
   bromide (RB) was introduced to restrain the animal in fMRI scanning
   time. The fMRI reactions of the animal induced with RB and the other two
   commonly used anesthesia protocols were investigated. The results of the
   fMRI showed that there were increased functional connectivity and
   well-round visual responses in the RB induced state. Furthermore,
   significant BOLD signal changes were found in the cortex and thalamus
   regions when the animal revived from isoflurane, which should be
   essential to further understand the effects of anesthesia on the brain.},

Title = {Self-supervised Natural Image Reconstruction and Large-scale Semantic
   Classification from Brain Activity},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {254},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Reconstructing natural images and decoding their semantic category from
   fMRI brain recordings is challenging. Acquiring sufficient pairs of
   images and their corresponding fMRI responses, which span the huge space
   of natural images, is prohibitive. We present a novel self-supervised
   approach that goes well beyond the scarce paired data, for achieving
   both: (i) state-of-the art fMRI-to-image reconstruction, and (ii)
   first-ever large-scale semantic classification from fMRI responses. By
   imposing cycle consistency between a pair of deep neural networks (from
   image-to-fMRI \& from fMRI-to-image), we train our image reconstruction
   network on a large number of ``unpaired `` natural images (images
   without fMRI recordings) from many novel semantic categories. This
   enables to adapt our reconstruction network to a very rich semantic
   coverage without requiring any explicit semantic supervision.
   Specifically, we find that combining our self-supervised training with
   high-level perceptual losses , gives rise to new reconstruction \&
   classification capabilities. In particular, this perceptual training
   enables to classify well fMRIs of never-before-seen semantic classes,
   without requiring any class labels during training . This gives rise to:
   (i) Unprecedented image-reconstruction from fMRI of never-before-seen
   images (evaluated by image metrics and human testing), and (ii)
   Large-scale semantic classification of categories that were
   never-before-seen during network training. Such large-scale (1000-way)
   semantic classification from fMRI recordings has never been demonstrated
   before . Finally, we provide evidence for the biological consistency of
   our learned model.},

Title = {Resting state network connectivity is attenuated by fMRI acoustic noise'},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {247},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Introduction: During the past decades there has been an increasing
   interest in tracking brain network fluctuations in health and disease by
   means of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).
   Rs-fMRI however does not provide the ideal environmental setting, as
   participants are continuously exposed to noise generated by MRI coils
   during acquisition of Echo Planar Imaging (EPI). We investigated the
   effect of EPI noise on resting state activity and connectivity using
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), by reproducing the acoustic
   characteristics of rs-fMRI environment during the recordings. As
   compared to fMRI, MEG has little sensitivity to brain activity generated
   in deep brain structures, but has the advantage to capture both the
   dynamic of cortical magnetic oscillations with high temporal resolution
   and the slow magnetic fluctuations highly correlated with BOLD signal.
   Methods: Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in a counterbalanced
   design study including three conditions: a) silent resting state
   (Silence), b) resting state upon EPI noise (fMRI), and c) resting state
   upon white noise (White). White noise was employed to test the
   specificity of fMRI noise effect. The amplitude envelope correlation
   (AEC) in alpha band measured the connectivity of seven Resting State
   Networks (RSN) of interest (default mode network, dorsal attention
   network, language, left and right auditory and left and right
   sensory-motor). Vigilance dynamic was estimated from power spectral
   activity.
   Results: fMRI and White acoustic noise consistently reduced connectivity
   of cortical networks. The effects were widespread, but noise and network
   specificities were also present. For fMRI noise, decreased connectivity
   was found in the right auditory and sensory-motor networks. Progressive
   increase of slow theta-delta activity related to drowsiness was found in
   all conditions, but was significantly higher for fMRI. Theta-delta
   significantly and positively correlated with variations of cortical
   connectivity.
   Discussion: rs-fMRI connectivity is biased by unavoidable environmental
   factors during scanning, which warrant more careful control and improved
   experimental designs. MEG is free from acoustic noise and allows a
   sensitive estimation of resting state connectivity in cortical areas.
   Although underutilized, MEG could overcome issues related to noise
   during fMRI, in particular when investigation of motor and auditory
   networks is needed.},

Abstract = {Cluster analysis (CA) is often used in functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) analysis to improve detection of functional activations.
   Commonly used clustering techniques typically only consider spatial
   information of a statistical parametric image (SPI) in their
   calculations. This study examines incorporating the temporal
   characteristics of acquired fMRI data with mean-shift clustering (MSC)
   for fMRI analysis to enhance activation detections. Simulated data and
   real fMRI data was used to compare the commonly used cluster analysis
   with MSC using a feature space containing temporal characteristics.
   Receiver Operating Characteristic curves show that improvements in low
   contrast to noise scenarios using MSC over CA and our previous MSC
   technique at all tested simulated activation sizes. The proposed MSC
   technique with a feature space using both temporal and spatial data
   characteristics shows improved activation detection for both simulated
   and real Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data (approximately
   60\% increase). The proposed techniques are useful in techniques that
   inherently have low contrast to noise ratios, such as non-proton imaging
   or high resolution BOLD fMRI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Global and structured waves of rs-fMRI signal identified as putative
   propagation of spontaneous neural activity},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {331-340},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Conventional resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies have focused on
   investigating the synchronous neural activity in functionally relevant
   distant regions that are termed as resting-state networks. On the other
   hand, less is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spontaneous
   activity of the brain. By examining the characteristics of both rs-fMRI
   and vascular time lag that was measured using dynamic susceptibility
   contrast-enhanced perfusion weighted imaging, the present study
   identifies several structured propagation of the rs-fMRI signal as
   putative neural streams. Temporal shift of both rs-fMRI and perfusion
   imaging data in each voxel compared with the averaged whole-brain signal
   was computed using cross-correlation analysis. In contrast to the
   uniformity of the vascular time lag across subjects, whole-brain rs-fMRI
   time lag was estimated to be composed of three independent components.
   After regression of vascular time lag, independent component analysis
   was applied to rs-fMRI data. The putative neural streams showed slow
   propagation of the signal from task-positive regions to main nodes of
   the default mode network, which may represent a mode of transmission
   underlying the interactions among the resting-state networks. (C) 2016

Title = {Identifying Respiration-Related Aliasing Artifacts in the Rodent
   Resting-State fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) combined
   with optogenetics and electrophysiological/calcium recordings in animal
   models is becoming a popular platform to investigate brain dynamics
   under specific neurological states. Physiological noise originating from
   the cardiac and respiration signal is the dominant interference in human
   rs-fMRI and extensive efforts have been made to reduce these artifacts
   from the human data. In animal fMRI studies, physiological noise sources
   including the respiratory and cardiorespiratory artifacts to the rs-fMRI
   signal fluctuation have typically been less investigated. In this
   article, we demonstrate evidence of aliasing effects into the
   low-frequency rs-fMRI signal fluctuation mainly due to
   respiration-induced BO offsets in anesthetized rats. This aliased signal
   was examined by systematically altering the fMRI sampling rate, i.e.,
   the time of repetition (TR), in free-breathing conditions and by
   adjusting the rate of ventilation. Anesthetized rats under ventilation
   showed a significantly narrower frequency bandwidth of the aliasing
   effect than free-breathing animals. It was found that the aliasing
   effect could be further reduced in ventilated animals with a muscle
   relaxant. This work elucidates the respiration-related aliasing effects
   on the rs-fMRI signal fluctuation from anesthetized rats, indicating
   non-negligible physiological noise needed to be taken care of in both
   awake and anesthetized animal rs-fMRI studies.},

   Resonance Imaging: A Review},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful modality to
   study brain activity. To approximate naturalistic writing and drawing
   behaviours inside the scanner, many fMRI-compatible tablet technologies
   have been developed. The digitizing feature of the tablets also allows
   examination of behavioural kinematics with greater detail than using
   paper. With enhanced ecological validity, tablet devices have advanced
   the fields of neuropsychological tests, neurosurgery, and
   neurolinguistics. Specifically, tablet devices have been used to adopt
   many traditional paper-based writing and drawing neuropsychological
   tests for fMRI. In functional neurosurgery, tablet technologies have
   enabled intra-operative brain mapping during awake craniotomy in brain
   tumour patients, as well as quantitative tremor assessment for treatment
   outcome monitoring. Tablet devices also play an important role in
   identifying the neural correlates of writing in the healthy and diseased
   brain. The fMRI-compatible tablets provide an excellent platform to
   support naturalistic motor responses and examine detailed behavioural
   kinematics.},

Abstract = {Objective: Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   from multiple subjects is at the heart of many medical imaging studies,
   and approaches based on dictionary learning (DL) are recently noted as
   promising solutions to the problem. However, the DL-based methods for
   fMRI analysis proposed to date do not naturally extend to multisubject
   analysis. In this paper, we propose a DL algorithm for multisubject fMRI
   data analysis. Methods: The proposed algorithm {[}named shared and
   subject-specific dictionary learning (ShSSDL)] is derived based on a
   temporal concatenation, which is particularly attractive for the
   analysis of multisubject task-related fMRI datasets. It differs from
   existing DL algorithms in both its sparse coding and dictionary update
   stages and has the advantage of learning a dictionary shared by all
   subjects as well as a set of subject-specific dictionaries. Results: The
   performance of the proposed DL algorithm is illustrated using simulated
   and real fMRI datasets. The results show that it can successfully
   extract shared as well as subject-specific latent components.
   Conclusion: In addition to offering a new DL approach, when applied on
   multisubject fMRI data analysis, the proposed algorithm generates a
   group level as well as a set of subject-specific spatial maps.
   Significance: The proposed algorithm has the advantage of learning
   simultaneously multiple dictionaries providing us with a shared as well
   discriminative source of information about the analyzed fMRI datasets.},

Title = {Decoding the brain state-dependent relationship between pupil dynamics
   and resting state fMRI signal fluctuation},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Pupil dynamics serve as a physiological indicator of cognitive processes
   and arousal states of the brain across a diverse range of behavioral
   experiments. Pupil diameter changes reflect brain state fluctuations
   driven by neuromodulatory systems. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been
   used to identify global patterns of neuronal correlation with pupil
   diameter changes; however, the linkage between distinct brain
   state-dependent activation patterns of neuromodulatory nuclei with pupil
   dynamics remains to be explored. Here, we identified four clusters of
   trials with unique activity patterns related to pupil diameter changes
   in anesthetized rat brains. Going beyond the typical rs-fMRI correlation
   analysis with pupil dynamics, we decomposed spatiotemporal patterns of
   rs-fMRI with principal component analysis (PCA) and characterized the
   cluster-specific pupil-fMRI relationships by optimizing the PCA
   component weighting via decoding methods. This work shows that pupil
   dynamics are tightly coupled with different neuromodulatory centers in
   different trials, presenting a novel PCA-based decoding method to study
   the brain state-dependent pupil-fMRI relationship.},

   initial findings},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Emotions involve many cortical and subcortical regions, prominently
   including the amygdala. It remains unknown how these multiple network
   components interact, and it remains unknown how they cause the
   behavioral, autonomic, and experiential effects of emotions. Here we
   describe a framework for combining a novel technique, concurrent
   electrical stimulation with fMRI (es-fMRI), together with a novel
   analysis, inferring causal structure from fMRI data (causal discovery).
   We outline a research program for investigating human emotion with these
   new tools, and provide initial findings from two large resting-state
   datasets as well as case studies in neurosurgical patients with
   electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The overarching goal is to use
   causal discovery methods on fMRI data to infer causal graphical models
   of how brain regions interact, and then to further constrain these
   models with direct stimulation of specific brain regions and concurrent
   fMRI. We conclude by discussing limitations and future extensions. The
   approach could yield anatomical hypotheses about brain connectivity,
   motivate rational strategies for treating mood disorders with deep brain
   stimulation, and could be extended to animal studies that use combined
   optogenetic fMRI.},

Abstract = {F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) estimate brain activities
   from different aspects, including regional glucose uptake (rGU) by
   (18)FDG-PET, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by arterial spin
   labeling, and dynamic changes of deoxyhemoglobin by blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   However, the relationships between them remain incompletely understood.
   In the current study, twenty-four subjects (14 males, 10 females) were
   recruited and investigated the correlation among rGU, rCBF, and BOLD
   fMRI-derived metrics reflecting the neural activity, including amplitude
   of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and
   degree centrality (DC) by hybrid PET/fMRI. Correlation analyses were
   performed across subject and across space at both voxel level and region
   level, considering partial volume effects by adjusting for gray matter
   volume. Each pair of metrics showed significant across-space
   correlations. rGU against ReHo showed the highest mean correlation
   coefficients. rGU had higher correlations with three resting-state (RS)
   fMRI metrics than did ASL-rCBF. However, the across-subject correlations
   were not significant among functional modalities (rGU, rCBF, and RS-fMRI
   BOLD data) at either voxel level or region level even with a liberal
   threshold, except for significant across-subject correlation between
   RS-fMRI metrics (ALFF, ReHo, and DC). These comprehensive findings from
   hybrid PET/MR might provide complementary information to reveal the
   underlying mechanisms of the brain activity and open new perspective to
   interpret pathologic conditions.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that it is feasible to record simultaneously
   intracerebral EEG (icEEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in patients with epilepsy. While it has mainly been used to
   explore the hemodynamic changes associated with epileptic spikes, this
   approach could also provide new insight into human cognition. However,
   the first step is to ensure that cognitive EEG components, that have
   lower amplitudes than epileptic spikes, can be appropriately detected
   under fMRI. We compared the high frequency activities (HFA, 50-150 Hz)
   elicited by a reading task in icEEG- only and subsequent icEEG-fMRI in
   the same patients (n = 3), implanted with depth electrodes. Comparable
   responses were obtained, with 71\% of the recording sites that responded
   during the icEEG- only session also responding during the icEEG- fMRI
   session. For all the remaining sites, nearby clusters (distant of 7 mm
   or less) also demonstrated significant HFA increase during the icEEG-
   fMRI session. Significant HFA increases were also observable at the
   single-trial level in icEEG- fMRI recordings. Our results show that
   low-amplitude icEEG signal components such as cognitive-induced HFAs can
   be reliably recorded with simultaneous fMRI. This paves the way for the
   use of icEEG- fMRI to address various fundamental and clinical issues,
   notably the identification of the neural correlates of the BOLD signal.},

Title = {Mapping and comparing fMRI connectivity networks across species},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Technical advances in neuroimaging, notably in fMRI, have allowed
   distributed patterns of functional connectivity to be mapped in the
   human brain with increasing spatiotemporal resolution. Recent years have
   seen a growing interest in extending this approach to rodents and
   non-human primates to understand the mechanism of fMRI connectivity and
   complement human investigations of the functional connectome. Here, we
   discuss current challenges and opportunities of fMRI connectivity
   mapping across species. We underscore the critical importance of
   physiologically decoding neuroimaging measures of brain
   (dys)connectivity via multiscale mechanistic investigations in animals.
   We next highlight a set of general principles governing the organization
   of mammalian connectivity networks across species. These include the
   presence of evolutionarily conserved network systems, a dominant
   cortical axis of functional connectivity, and a common repertoire of
   topographically conserved fMRI spatiotemporal modes. We finally describe
   emerging approaches allowing comparisons and extrapolations of fMRI
   connectivity findings across species. As neuroscientists gain access to
   increasingly sophisticated perturbational, computational and recording
   tools, cross-species fMRI offers novel opportunities to investigate the
   large-scale organization of the mammalian brain in health and disease.
   This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of fMRI
   connectivity mapping across species and highlights a set of general
   principles governing the organization of mammalian connectivity
   networks.},

Title = {Feasibility of training the dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal network by
   real-time fMRI neurofeedback},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NF) is a promising non-invasive
   technique that enables volitional control of usually covert brain
   processes. While most rt-fMRI NF studies so far have demonstrated the
   ability of the method to evoke changes in brain activity and improve
   symptoms of mental disorders, a recently evolving field is network-based
   functional connectivity (FC) rt-fMRI NF. However, FC rt-fMRI NF has
   methodological challenges such as respirational artefacts that could
   potentially bias the training if not controlled. In this randomized,
   double-blind, yoke-controlled, pre-registered FC rt-fMRI NF study with
   healthy participants (N = 40) studied over three training days, we
   tested the feasibility of an FC rt-fMRI NF approach with online global
   signal regression (GSR) to control for physiological artefacts for
   up-regulation of connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal
   network. While our pre-registered null hypothesis significance tests
   failed to reach criterion, we estimated the FC training effect at a
   medium effect size at the end of the third training day after rigorous
   control of physiological artefacts in the offline data. This hints at
   the potential of FC rt-fMRI NF for the development of innovative
   transdiagnostic circuit-specific interventional approaches for mental
   disorders and the effect should now be confirmed in a well-powered
   study.},

Title = {The Effect of Tumor Neovasculature on Functional Magnetic Resonance

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report the case of a 40-year-old patient with a large,
   World Health Organization grade III oligodendroglioma in the left
   parietal lobe.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Presurgical planning included functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) localization of language, motor, and
   somatosensory processing. fMRI results for motor and somatosensory tasks
   revealed activation in perilesional regions near the surgical resection
   as well as deactivation in the tumor for the sensory task, suggesting
   decreased autoregulation in the region owing to the glioma. fMRI results
   showed left-hemisphere dominance for language and activation in
   perilesional regions for all 3 speech tasks (i.e., word reading, picture
   naming, and semantic questions). In addition, the results demonstrated
   that the high vascularity of the lesion altered the blood oxygen
   leveledependent function, resulting in false-positive and false-negative
   activation in the semantic questions and leg/foot rubbing task,
   respectively. Intraoperative direct cortical stimulation was conducted
   in the regions corresponding to fMRI activation while the patient
   performed motor, sensory, and language tasks and showed no loss of
   function. Follow-up fMRI revealed that there was no longer activation in
   the tumor or in perilesional regions, presumably owing to the resection
   of the vascularized tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of presurgical fMRI to
   inform the neurosurgical approach and emphasizes the need for careful
   interpretation of fMRI data, especially in cases of malignant glioma,
   which can decrease autoregulation in surrounding regions, affecting fMRI
   blood oxygen leveledependent signal.},

Title = {Brain network connectivity feature extraction using deep learning for
   Alzheimer's disease classification},
Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {782},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) is currently the only viable option for improving clinical
   outcomes. Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to
   diagnose AD has yielded promising results. Most studies assume fixed
   time lags when constructing functional networks. Since the propagation
   delays between brain signals are constantly changing, these methods
   cannot reflect more detailed relationships between brain regions. In
   this work, we use a deep learning-based Granger causality estimator for
   brain connectivity construction. It exploits the strength of long
   short-term memory in ever-changing time series processing. This research
   involves data analysis from sMRI and rs-fMRI. We use sMRI to analyze the
   cerebral cortex properties and use rs-fMRI to analyze the graph metrics
   of functional networks. We extract a small subset of optimal features
   from both types of data. A support vector machine (SVM) is trained and
   tested to classify AD (n = 27) from healthy controls (n = 20) using
   rs-fMRI and sMRI features. Using a subset of optimal features in SVM, we
   achieve a classification accuracy of 87.23\% for sMRI, 78.72\% for
   rs-fMRI, and 91.49\% for combined sMRI with rs-fMRI. The results show
   the potential to identify AD from healthy controls by integrating

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {The increasing incidence of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases
   requires increasingly sophisticated tools for their diagnosis and
   monitoring. Clinical assessment takes advantage of objective parameters
   extracted by electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   among others, to support clinical management of neurological diseases.
   The complementarity of these two tools can be now emphasized by the
   possibility of integrating the two technologies in a hybrid solution,
   allowing simultaneous acquisition of the two signals by the novel
   EEG-fMRI technology. This review will focus on simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   technology and related early studies, dealing about issues related to
   the acquisition and processing of simultaneous signals, and including
   critical discussion about clinical and technological perspectives.},

Title = {Taking the 4D Nature of fMRI Data Into Account Promises Significant
   Gains in Data Completion},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {145334-145362},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful, noninvasive
   tool that has significantly contributed to the understanding of the
   human brain. FMRI data provide a sequence of whole-brain volumes over
   time and hence are inherently four dimensional (4D). Missing data in
   fMRI experiments arise from image acquisition limits, susceptibility and
   motion artifacts or during confounding noise removal. Hence, significant
   brain regions may be excluded from the data, which can seriously
   undermine the quality of subsequent analyses due to the significant
   number of missing voxels. We take advantage of the four dimensional (4D)
   nature of fMRI data through a tensor representation and introduce an
   effective algorithm to estimate missing samples in fMRI data. The
   proposed Riemannian nonlinear spectral conjugate gradient (RSCG)
   optimization method uses tensor train (TT) decomposition, which enables
   compact representations and provides efficient linear algebra
   operations. Exploiting the Riemannian structure boosts algorithm
   performance significantly, as evidenced by the comparison of RSCG-TT
   with state-of-the-art stochastic gradient methods, which are developed
   in the Euclidean space. We thus provide an effective method for
   estimating missing brain voxels and, more importantly, clearly show that
   taking the full 4D structure of fMRI data into account provides
   important gains when compared with three-dimensional (3D) and the most
   commonly used two-dimensional (2D) representations of fMRI data.},

Abstract = {The spontaneous dynamics of the brain modulate its function from moment
   to moment, shaping neural computation and cognition. Functional MRI
   (fMRI), while classically used as a tool for spatial localization, is
   increasingly being used to identify the temporal dynamics of brain
   activity. fMRI analyses focused on the temporal domain have revealed
   important new information about the dynamics underlying states such as
   arousal, attention, and sleep. Dense temporal sampling - either by using
   fast fMRI acquisition, or multiple repeated scan sessions within
   individuals - can further enrich the information present in these
   studies. This review focuses on recent developments in using fMRI to
   identify dynamics across brain states, particularly vigilance and sleep
   states, and the potential for highly temporally sampled fMRI to answer
   these questions.},

Abstract = {Despite many calls, functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies are relatively rare in the domain of entrepreneurship research.
   This methodological brief presents the brain-imaging method of
   resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and illustrates its application in
   neuroentrepreneurship for the first time. In contrast to the traditional
   task-based fMRI approach, rs-fMRI observes the brain in the absence of
   cognitive tasks or presentation of stimuli, which offers benefits for
   improving our understanding of the entrepreneurial mind. Here, we
   describe the method and provide methodological motivations for
   performing brain resting-state functional neuroimaging studies on
   entrepreneurs. In addition, we illustrate the use of seed-based
   correlation analysis, one of the most common analytical approaches for
   analyzing rs-fMRI data. In this illustration, we show that habitual
   entrepreneurs have increased functional connectivity between the insula
   (a region associated with cognitive flexibility) and the anterior
   prefrontal cortex (a key region for explorative choice) as compared to
   managers. This increased connectivity could help promote flexible
   behavior. Thus in brief, we provide an exemplar of a novel way to expand
   our understanding of the brain in the domain of entrepreneurship. We
   discuss possible directions for future research and challenges to be
   addressed to facilitate the inclusion of re-fMRI studies into
   neuroentrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {Layer fMRI, requiring high field, advanced pulse sequences, and
   sophisticated processing methods, has emerged in the last decade. The
   rate of layer fMRI papers published has grown sharply as more groups are
   overcoming the substantial technical challenges and the unique
   advantages are becoming clear. Rather than simple delineation of
   functional activation, layer fMRI promises to provide directional
   activity and connectivity measures as they are inferred by the
   layer-specific location. This short review highlights the methods used
   to achieve layer fMRI as well as the challenges in acquisition,
   processing and interpretation. It emphasizes the utility of extensive
   individual averaging as well as the extreme difficulty of cross subject
   averaging. It also highlights recent studies that have explored layer
   fMRI in cognitive tasks as well as resting state connectivity studies
   that have revealed cortical hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) records brain activity with excellent
   temporal and good spatial resolution, while functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) offers good temporal and excellent spatial
   resolution. The aim of this study is to implement a Bayesian framework
   to use fMRI data as spatial priors for MEG inverse solutions. We used
   simulated MEG data with both evoked and induced activity and
   experimental MEG data from sixteen participants to examine the
   effectiveness of using fMRI spatial priors in MEG source reconstruction.
   For simulated MEG data, incorporating the prior information from fMRI
   increased the spatial resolution of MEG source reconstruction by 3 mm on
   average. For experimental MEG data, fMRI spatial information reduced the
   spurious clusters for evoked activity and showed more left-lateralized
   activation pattern for induced activity. The use of fMRI spatial priors
   greatly reduced location error for induced source in MEG data. Our
   results provide empirical evidence that the use of fMRI spatial priors
   improves the accuracy of MEG source reconstruction. The combined MEG and
   fMRI approach can provide neuroimaging data with better spatial and
   temporal resolutions to add another perspective to our understanding of
   the neurobiology of language. The potential clinical applications
   include pre-surgical evaluation of language function for epilepsy
   patients and evaluation of language network for children with language
   disorders.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a cost-efficient
   and portable alternative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   for assessing cortical activity changes based on hemodynamic signals.
   The spatial and temporal underpinnings of the fMRI
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal and corresponding fNIRS
   concentration of oxygenated (HbO), deoxygenated (HbR), and total
   hemoglobin (HbT) measurements are still not completely clear. We aim to
   analyze the spatial correspondence between these hemodynamic signals, in
   motor-network regions. To this end, we acquired asynchronous fMRI and
   fNIRS recordings from 9 healthy participants while performing motor
   imagery and execution. Using this multimodal approach, we investigated
   the ability to identify motor-related activation clusters in fMRI data
   using subject-specific fNIRS-based cortical signals as predictors of
   interest. Group-level activation was found in fMRI data modeled from
   corresponding fNIRS measurements, with significant peak activation found
   overlapping the individually-defined primary and premotor motor
   cortices, for all chromophores. No statistically significant differences
   were observed in multimodal spatial correspondence between HbO, HbR, and
   HbT, for both tasks. This suggests the possibility of translating
   neuronal information from fMRI into an fNIRS motor-coverage setup with
   high spatial correspondence using both oxy and deoxyhemoglobin data,
   with the inherent benefits of translating fMRI paradigms to fNIRS in
   cognitive and clinical neuroscience.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives Naming decline after left temporal lobe
   epilepsy (TLE) surgery is common and difficult to predict. Preoperative
   language fMRI may predict naming decline, but this application is still
   lacking evidence. We performed a large multicenter cohort study of the
   effectiveness of fMRI in predicting naming deficits after left TLE
   surgery. Methods At 10 US epilepsy centers, 81 patients with left TLE
   were prospectively recruited and given the Boston Naming Test (BNT)
   before and approximate to 7 months after anterior temporal lobectomy. An
   fMRI language laterality index (LI) was measured with an auditory
   semantic decision-tone decision task contrast. Correlations and a
   multiple regression model were built with a priori chosen predictors.
   Results Naming decline occurred in 56\% of patients and correlated with
   fMRI LI (r = -0.41, p < 0.001), age at epilepsy onset (r = -0.30, p =
   0.006), age at surgery (r = -0.23, p = 0.039), and years of education (r
   = 0.24, p = 0.032). Preoperative BNT score and duration of epilepsy were
   not correlated with naming decline. The regression model explained 31\%
   of the variance, with fMRI contributing 14\%, with a 96\% sensitivity
   and 44\% specificity for predicting meaningful naming decline.
   Cross-validation resulted in an average prediction error of 6 points.
   Discussion An fMRI-based regression model predicted naming outcome after
   left TLE surgery in a large, prospective multicenter sample, with fMRI
   as the strongest predictor. These results provide evidence supporting
   the use of preoperative language fMRI to predict language outcome in
   patients undergoing left TLE surgery. Classification of Evidence This
   study provides Class I evidence that fMRI language lateralization can
   help in predicting naming decline after left TLE surgery.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Electrical epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is used as a
   treatment for chronic pain as well as to partially restore motor
   function after a spinal cord injury. Monitoring the spinal cord activity
   during SCS with fMRI could provide important and objective measures of
   integrative responses to treatment. Unfortunately, spinal cord fMRI is
   severely challenged by motion and susceptibility artifacts induced by
   the implanted electrode and bones. This pilot study introduces
   multi-band sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (MB-SWIFT)
   technique for spinal cord fMRI during SCS in rats. Given the close to
   zero acquisition delay and high bandwidth in 3 dimensions, MB-SWIFT is
   demonstrated to be highly tolerant to motion and susceptibility-induced
   artifacts and thus holds promise for fMRI during SCS.
   Methods: MB-SWIFT with 0.78 X 0.78 X 1.50 mm(3) spatial resolution and
   3-s temporal resolution was used at 9.4 Tesla in rats undergoing
   epidural SCS at different frequencies. Its performance was compared with
   spin echo EPI. The origin of the functional contrast was also explored
   using suppression bands.
   Results: MB-SWIFT was tolerant to electrode-induced artifacts and
   respiratory motion, leading to substantially higher fMRI sensitivity
   than spin echo fMRI. Clear stimulation frequency-dependent responses to
   SCS were detected in the rat spinal cord close to the stimulation site.
   The origin of MB-SWIFT fMRI signals was consistent with dominant inflow
   effects.
   Conclusion: fMRI of the rat spinal cord during SCS can be consistently
   achieved with MB-SWIFT, thus providing a valuable experimental framework
   for assessing the effects of SCS on the central nervous system.},

Title = {Effects of Physiological Signal Removal on Resting-State Functional MRI
   Metrics},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Resting-state fMRIs (rs-fMRIs) have been widely used for investigation
   of diverse brain functions, including brain cognition. The rs-fMRI has
   easily elucidated rs-fMRI metrics, such as the fractional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo),
   voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and degree centrality
   (DC). To increase the applicability of these metrics, higher reliability
   is required by reducing confounders that are not related to the
   functional connectivity signal. Many previous studies already
   demonstrated the effects of physiological artifact removal from rs-fMRI
   data, but few have evaluated the effect on rs-fMRI metrics. In this
   study, we examined the effect of physiological noise correction on the
   most common rs-fMRI metrics. We calculated the intraclass correlation
   coefficient of repeated measurements on parcellated brain areas by
   applying physiological noise correction based on the RETROICOR method.
   Then, we evaluated the correction effect for five rs-fMRI metrics for
   the whole brain: FC, fALFF, ReHo, VMHC, and DC. The correction effect
   depended not only on the brain region, but also on the metric. Among the
   five metrics, the reliability in terms of the mean value of all ROIs was
   significantly improved for FC, but it deteriorated for fALFF, with no
   significant differences for ReHo, VMHC, and DC. Therefore, the decision
   on whether to perform the physiological correction should be based on
   the type of metric used.},

Title = {QMVO-SCDL: A new regression model for fMRI pain decoding using
   quantum-behaved sparse dictionary learning},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {252},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {The exponential growth of functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI)
   data offers a great opportu-nity for basic and clinical research to
   explore functional brain activity. Nonetheless, due to the lack of
   effective and efficient tools for handling high-dimensional and complex
   fMRI data, this potential has still not been fully explored. A critical
   issue to be addressed is to identify clinically relevant features from
   high dimensional fMRI data in a fast and accurate manner. To address
   this problem, a new quantum-behaved multiverse optimization (QMVO)
   approach is proposed for fMRI dimensionality reduction and a new
   prediction approach based on L1-norm sparse coding and adaptive
   dictionary learning (SCDL) is developed to decode the whole brain fMRI
   data. QMVO is designed to enhance local search ability, avoid premature
   convergence, and increase population diversity among individuals.
   Further, to efficiently re-estimate parameters of the prediction model
   with new available data, a new SCDL sparse coding is proposed, which
   requires no training and needs minimal parameters to tune. The proposed
   QMVO-SCDL model is applied to a pain-evoked fMRI dataset to decode the
   pain perception level. Results show that QMVO-SCDL can decode pain
   levels and identify predictive fMRI patterns with high accuracy, high
   convergence speed, and short consumption time. Moreover, the performance
   of the proposed model outperforms different recent ML techniques.
   Therefore, the proposed model has a great promise to be a powerful tool
   for fMRI decoding. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Prior studies indicate that anxiety disorders are associated with
   heightened sensitivity to uncertain threat (U threat). Individual
   differences in reactivity to U threat have been measured in the
   laboratory with two methodologiesstartle eyeblink potentiation and fMRI.
   While startle and fMRI are purported to relate to each other, very
   little research exists on whether individual differences in one measure
   are associated with individual differences in another and, thus, whether
   startle and fMRI capture shared mechanisms. Therefore, the current study
   was designed to investigate if and where in the brain measures of
   startle potentiation and fMRI BOLD signal correlate during response to U
   threat across two independent samples. Participants in both studies
   completed two threat anticipation tasks-once during collection of
   startle potentiation and once during fMRI. In Study 1 (n=43), the
   startle and fMRI tasks both used electric shock as the threat. As an
   extension, in Study 2 (n=38), the startle task used electric shock but
   the fMRI task used aversive images. Despite these methodological
   differences, greater startle potentiation to U threat was associated
   with greater dorsal anterior cingulate, caudate, and orbitofrontal
   cortex reactivity to U threat in both samples. The findings suggest that
   startle and fMRI measures of responding to U threat overlap, and points
   toward an integrated brain-behavior profile of aberrant U threat
   responding.},

Abstract = {Abnormal structural and functional connectivity in the striatum during
   neurological disorders has been reported using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), although the effects of cell-type specific
   neuronal stimulation on fMRI and related behavioral alterations are not
   well understood. In this study, we combined DREADD technology with fMRI
   ({''}chemo-fMRI{''}) to investigate alterations of spontaneous neuronal
   activity. These were induced by the unilateral activation of dopamine D1
   receptor-expressing neurons (D1-neurons) in the mouse dorsal striatum
   (DS). After clozapine (CLZ) stimulation of the excitatory DREADD
   expressed in Dl-neurons, the fractional amplitude of low frequency
   fluctuations (fALFF) increased bilaterally in the medial thalamus,
   nucleus accumbens and cortex. In addition, we found that the gamma-band
   of local field potentials was increased in the stimulated DS and cortex
   bilaterally. These results provide insights for better interpretation of
   cell type-specific activity changes in fMRI.},

Abstract = {Thousands of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
   provided important insight into the human brain. However, only a handful
   of these studies tested infants while they were awake, because of the
   significant and unique methodological challenges involved. We report our
   efforts to address these challenges, with the goal of creating methods
   for awake infant fMRI that can reveal the inner workings of the
   developing, preverbal mind. We use these methods to collect and analyze
   two fMRI datasets obtained from infants during cognitive tasks, released
   publicly with this paper. In these datasets, we explore and evaluate
   data quantity and quality, task-evoked activity, and preprocessing
   decisions. We disseminate these methods by sharing two software packages
   that integrate infant-friendly cognitive tasks and eye-gaze monitoring
   with fMRI acquisition and analysis. These resources make fMRI a feasible
   and accessible technique for cognitive neuroscience in awake and
   behaving human infants.},

Title = {Laminar fMRI and computational theories of brain function},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {699-706},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Recently developed methods for functional MRI at the resolution of
   cortical layers (laminar fMRI) offer a novel window into
   neurophysiological mechanisms of cortical activity. Beyond physiology,
   laminar fMRI also offers an unprecedented opportunity to test
   influential theories of brain function. Specifically, hierarchical
   Bayesian theories of brain function, such as predictive coding, assign
   specific computational roles to different cortical layers. Combined with
   computational models, laminar fMRI offers a unique opportunity to test
   these proposals non-invasively in humans.
   This review provides a brief overview of predictive coding and related
   hierarchical Bayesian theories, summarises their predictions with regard
   to layered cortical computations, examines how these predictions could
   be tested by laminar fMRI, and considers methodological challenges. We
   conclude by discussing the potential of laminar fMRI for clinically
   useful computational assays of layer-specific information processing.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed using a mixture of
   psychological tests and clinical observations. However, these diagnoses
   are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help
   improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the
   disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into
   innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of
   neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI
   is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless,
   recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the
   simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of
   artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human
   neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI
   research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and
   classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this
   systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state
   fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we
   outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and
   classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the
   accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep
   learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new
   researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight
   the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.},

Abstract = {Since its development, spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) has utilized various methodologies and stimulation protocols to
   develop a deeper understanding of a healthy human spinal cord that lays
   a foundation for its use in clinical research and practice. In this
   review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search on spinal cord
   fMRI studies and summarized the recent advancements and resulting
   scientific achievements of spinal cord fMRI in the following three
   aspects: the current state of spinal cord fMRI methodologies and
   stimulation protocols, knowledge about the healthy spinal cord's
   functions obtained via spinal cord fMRI, and fMRI's exemplary usage in
   spinal cord diseases and injuries. We conclude with a discussion that,
   while technical challenges exist, novel fMRI technologies for and new
   knowledge about the healthy human spinal cord have been established.
   Empowered by these developments, investigations of pathological and
   injury states within the spinal cord have become the next important
   direction of spinal cord fMRI. Recent clinical investigations into
   spinal cord pathologies, for example, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis,
   spinal cord injury, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, have already
   provided deep insights into spinal cord impairments and the time course
   of impairment-caused changes. We expect that future spinal cord fMRI
   advancement and research development will further enhance our
   understanding of various spinal cord diseases and provide the foundation
   for evaluating existing and developing new treatment plans.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest the hippocampus is involved in working memory

   WM (beyond novelty encoding), which however are difficult to capture
   with conventional fMRI. Still, the advent of new fMRI techniques
   combined with a stronger emphasis on shared hippocampal mechanisms
   across short- and long-term memory pave an exciting path forward.},

Title = {Sparse Representation-Based Denoising for High-Resolution Brain
   Activation and Functional Connectivity Modeling: A Task fMRI Study},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {36728-36740},
Abstract = {In the field of neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience, functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study the
   functional localization and connectivity of the brain. However, the
   inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the fMRI signals greatly
   limits the accuracy and resolution of current studies. In addressing
   this fundamental challenge in fMRI analytics, in this work we develop
   and implement a denoising method for task fMRI (tfMRI) data in order to
   delineate the high-resolution spatial pattern of the brain activation
   and functional connectivity via dictionary learning and sparse coding
   (DLSC). In addition to the traditional unsupervised dictionary learning
   model which has shown success in image denoising, we further utilize the
   prior knowledge of task paradigm to learn a dictionary consisting of
   both data-driven and model-driven terms for a more stable sparse
   representation of the data. The proposed method is applied to preprocess
   the motor tfMRI dataset from Human Connectome Project (HCP) for the
   purpose of brain activation detection and functional connectivity
   estimation. Comparison between the results from original and denoised
   fMRI data shows that the disruptive brain activation and functional
   connectivity patterns can be recovered, and the prominence of such
   patterns is improved through denoising. The proposed method is then
   compared with the temporal non-local means (tNLM)-based denoising method
   and shows consistently superior performance in various experimental
   settings. The promising results show that the proposed DLSC-based fMRI
   denoising method can effectively reduce the noise level of the fMRI
   signals and increase the interpretability of the inferred results,
   therefore constituting a crucial part of the preprocessing pipeline and
   provide the foundation for further high-resolution functional analysis.},

Abstract = {This pilot study evaluated the usability of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect brain activation during phonation in
   healthy female singers with supraglottic compression. Four healthy
   female classical singers (mean age: 26 years) participated in the study.
   All subjects had normal vocal folds and vocal characteristics and showed
   supraglottic compression. The fMRI experiment was carried out using a
   block design paradigm. Brain activation during phonation and exhalation
   was analyzed using Brain Voyager software (Brain Innovation B.V.,
   Maastricht, The Netherlands). An fMRI data analysis showed a significant
   effect of phonation control in the bilateral pre/postcentral gyrus, and
   in the frontal, cingulate, superior and middle temporal gyrus, as well
   as in the parietal lobe, insula, lingual gyrus, cerebellum, thalamus and
   brainstem. These activation areas are consistent with previous reports
   using other fMRI protocols. In addition, a significant effect of
   phonation compared to exhalation control was found in the bilateral
   superior temporal gyrus, and the pre/postcentral gyrus. This fMRI pilot
   study allowed to detect a normal pattern of brain activity during
   phonation in healthy female singers with supraglottic compression using
   the proposed protocol. However, the pilot study detected problems with
   the experimental material/procedures that would necessitate refining the
   fMRI protocol. The phonation tasks were not capable to show brain
   activation difference between high-pitched and comfortable phonation.
   Further fMRI studies manipulating vocal parameters during phonation of
   the vowels /a/ and /i/ may elicit more distinctive hemodynamic response
   (HDR) activity patterns relative to voice modulation.},

Title = {Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus in healthy right-handed and

   lateralization on functional MRI},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) enables evaluation of language cortical
   organization and plays a central role in surgical planning. Diffusion
   Tensor Imaging (DTI) or Tractography, allows evaluation of the white
   matter fibers involved in language. Unlike fMRI, DTI does not rely on
   the patient's cooperation. In monolinguals, there is a significant
   correlation between the lateralization of language on fMRI and on DTI.
   Our objective is to delineate the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in right- and
   left-handed trilinguals and determine if the AF laterality on DTI is
   correlated to language lateralization on fMRI. 15 right and 15
   left-handed trilingual volunteers underwent fMRI and DTI. Laterality
   Index was determined on fMRI (fMRI-LI). Mean Diffusivity, Fractional
   Anisotropy (FA), Number of Fibers, Fiber Length, Fiber Volume and
   Laterality Index (DTI-LI) of the AF were calculated on DTI. 28 of the 30
   subjects presented a bilateral AF. Most subjects (52\%) were found to
   have a bilateral language lateralization of the AF on DTI. Only 4
   subjects had bilateral lateralization of language on fMRI. The right AF
   demonstrated lower diffusivity than the left AF in the total
   participants, the right-handed, and the left-handed subjects. FA, Volume
   and Length of the AF were not significantly different between the two
   hemispheres. No correlation was found between the DTI-LI of the AF and
   the fMRI-LI. A prominent role of the right AF and a bilateral structural
   organization of the AF was present in our multilingual population
   regardless of their handedness. While in prior studies DTI was able to
   determine language lateralization in monolingual subjects, this was not
   possible in trilingual highly educated subjects.},

Abstract = {Task-based approaches to functional localization of the motor cortex
   have limitations such as long scanning times and exclusion of patients
   with severe functional or neurologic disabilities and children.
   Resting-state fMRI may avoid these difficulties because patients do not
   perform any goal-directed tasks. Nineteen patients were prospectively
   evaluated by using task-based and resting-state fMRI to localize
   sensorimotor function. Independent component analyses were performed to
   generate spatial independent components reflecting functional brain
   networks or noise. The motor cortex was successfully and consistently
   identified by using resting-state fMRI. Hand, foot, and face regions
   were defined in a comparable fashion with task-based fMRI.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The functional characterization of the motor
   cortex is an important issue in the presurgical evaluation of brain
   lesions. fMRI noninvasively identifies motor areas while patients are
   asked to move different body parts. This task-based approach has some
   drawbacks in clinical settings: long scanning times and exclusion of
   patients with severe functional or neurologic disabilities and children.
   Resting-state fMRI can avoid these difficulties because patients do not
   perform any goal-directed tasks.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with diverse brain pathologies
   were prospectively evaluated by using task-based and resting-state fMRI
   to localize sensorimotor function. Independent component analyses were
   performed to generate spatial independent components reflecting
   functional brain networks or noise. Three radiologists identified the
   motor components and 3 portions of the motor cortex corresponding to the
   hand, foot, and face representations. Selected motor independent
   components were compared with task-based fMRI activation maps resulting
   from movements of the corresponding body parts.
   RESULTS: The motor cortex was successfully and consistently identified
   by using resting-state fMRI by the 3 radiologists for all patients. When
   they subdivided the motor cortex into 3 segments, the sensitivities of
   resting-state and task-based fMRI were comparable. Moreover, we report a
   good spatial correspondence with the task-based fMRI activity estimates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Resting-state fMRI can reliably image sensorimotor function
   in a clinical preoperative routine. It is a promising opportunity for
   presurgical localization of sensorimotor function and has the potential
   to benefit a large number of patients affected by a wide range of
   pathologies.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the high complexity of fMRI data and the great spatial
   dependence of existing methods, a whole-brain functional segmentation
   algorithm with low computational overhead and low spatial structure
   dependence is proposed for individual-level fMRI segmentation in 3-D
   space. First, the spatial information and functional connectivity of
   each voxel in fMRI are utilized for presegmentation to create compact
   and functionally consistent super voxels, then extracts features, such
   as average spatial coordinates and average time series at the super
   voxel level to reduce the computational effort of the segmentation
   algorithm, and performs segmentation in a cut-free manner to obtain the
   optimal segmentation graph by minimizing the energy function. The
   results of contrast experiment demonstrated that the algorithm fully
   exploits the connectivity information of fMRI for segmentation, relies
   less on the spatial structure, and achieves better functional
   segmentation results, which is an effective whole-brain functional
   segmentation method.},

Abstract = {Background For patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, surgery may be
   effective in controlling their disease. Surgical evaluation may involve
   localization of the language areas using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) or Wada testing. We evaluated the accuracy of task-based
   fMRI versus Wada-based language lateralization in a cohort of our
   epilepsy patients. Methods In a single-center, retrospective analysis,
   we identified patients with medically intractable epilepsy who
   participated in presurgical language mapping (n = 35) with fMRI and Wada
   testing. Demographic variables and imaging metrics were obtained. We
   calculated the laterality index (LI) from task-evoked fMRI activation
   maps across language areas during auditory and reading tasks to
   determine lateralization. Possible scores for LI range from -1 (strongly
   left-hemisphere dominant) to 1 (strongly right-hemisphere dominant).
   Concordance between fMRI and Wada was estimated using Cohen's Kappa
   coefficient. Association between the LI scores from the auditory and
   reading tasks was tested using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
   Results The fMRI-based laterality indices were concordant with results
   from Wada testing in 91.4\% of patients during the reading task (kappa =
   .55) and 96.9\% of patients during the auditory task (kappa = .79). The
   mean LIs for the reading and auditory tasks were -0.52 +/- 0.43 and
   -0.68 +/- 0.42, respectively. The LI scores for the language and reading
   tasks were strongly correlated, r(30) = 0.57 (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our
   findings suggest that fMRI is generally an accurate, low-risk
   alternative to Wada testing for language lateralization. However, when
   fMRI indicates atypical language lateralization (e.g., bilateral
   dominance), patients may benefit from subsequent Wada testing or
   intraoperative language mapping.},

Title = {Intraoperative Use of Functional MRI for Surgical Decision Making after
   Limited or Infeasible Electrocortical Stimulation Mapping},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is
   becoming widely recognized as a key component of preoperative
   neurosurgical planning, although intraoperative electrocortical
   stimulation (ECS) is considered the gold standard surgical brain mapping
   method. However, acquiring and interpreting ECS results can sometimes be
   challenging. This retrospective study assesses whether intraoperative
   availability of fMRI impacted surgical decision-making when ECS was
   problematic or unobtainable. METHODS Records were reviewed for 191
   patients who underwent presurgical fMRI with fMRI loaded into the
   neuronavigation system. Four patients were excluded as a bur-hole biopsy
   was performed. Imaging was acquired at 3 Tesla and analyzed using the
   general linear model with significantly activated pixels determined via
   individually determined thresholds. fMRI maps were displayed
   intraoperatively via commercial neuronavigation systems. RESULTS
   Seventy-one cases were planned ECS; however, 18 (25.35\%) of these
   procedures were either not attempted or aborted/limited due to: seizure
   (10), patient difficulty cooperating with the ECS mapping (4),
   scarring/limited dural opening (3), or dural bleeding (1). In all
   aborted/limited ECS cases, the surgeon continued surgery using fMRI to
   guide surgical decision-making. There was no significant difference in
   the incidence of postoperative deficits between cases with completed ECS
   and those with limited/aborted ECS. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative fMRI
   allowed for continuation of surgery in over one-fourth of patients in
   which planned ECS was incomplete or impossible, without a significantly
   different incidence of postoperative deficits compared to the patients
   with completed ECS. This demonstrates additional value of fMRI beyond
   presurgical planning, as fMRI data served as a backup method to ECS.},

Title = {The Impact of Spatial Normalization Strategies on the Temporal Features
   of the Resting-State Functional MRI: Spatial Normalization Before
   rs-fMRI Features Calculation May Reduce the Reliability},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
   studies frequently applied the spatial normalization on fMRI time series
   before the calculation of temporal features (here referred to as
   ``Prenorm{''}). We hypothesized that calculating the rs-fMRI features,
   for example, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo),
   or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in individual space,
   before the spatial normalization (referred to as ``Postnorm{''}) can be
   an improvement to avoid artifacts and increase the results' reliability.
   We utilized two datasets: (1) simulated images where temporal
   signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is kept a constant and (2) an empirical
   fMRI dataset with 50 healthy young subjects. For simulated images, the
   tSNR is constant as generated in individual space but increased after
   Prenorm and intersubject variability of tSNR was induced. In contrast,
   tSNR was kept constant after Postnorm. Consistently, for empirical
   images, higher tSNR, ReHo, and FC (default mode network, seed in
   precuneus) and lower ALFF were found after Prenorm compared to those of
   Postnorm. Coefficient of variability of tSNR and ALFF was higher after
   Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Moreover, the significant
   correlation was found between simulated tSNR after Prenorm and empirical
   tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo after Prenorm, indicating algorithmic variation in
   empirical rs-fMRI features. Furthermore, comparing to Prenorm, ALFF and
   ReHo showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients between two
   serial scans after Postnorm. Our results indicated that Prenorm may
   induce algorithmic intersubject variability on tSNR and reduce its
   reliability, which also significantly affected ALFF and ReHo. We suggest
   using Postnorm instead of Prenorm for future rs-fMRI studies using
   ALFF/ReHo.},

Abstract = {Background: Understanding brain function requires knowledge of how one
   brain region causally influences another. This information is difficult
   to obtain directly in the human brain, and is instead typically inferred
   from resting-state fMRI.
   New method: Here, we demonstrate the safety and scientific promise of a
   novel and complementary approach: concurrent electrical stimulation and
   fMRI (es-fMRI) at 3 T in awake neurosurgical patients with implanted
   depth electrodes.
   Results: We document the results of safety testing, actual experimental
   setup, and stimulation parameters, that safely and reliably evoke
   activation in distal structures through stimulation of amygdala,
   cingulate, or prefrontal cortex. We compare connectivity inferred from
   the evoked patterns of activation with that estimated from standard
   resting-state fMRI in the same patients: while connectivity patterns
   obtained with each approach are correlated, each method produces unique
   results. Response patterns were stable over the course of 11 min of
   es-fMRI runs. Comparison with existing method: es-fMRI in awake humans
   yields unique information about effective connectivity, complementing
   resting-state fMRI. Although our stimulations were below the level of
   inducing any apparent behavioral or perceptual effects, a next step
   would be to use es-fMRI to modulate task performances. This would reveal
   the acute network-level changes induced by the stimulation that mediate
   the behavioral and cognitive effects seen with brain stimulation.
   Conclusions: es-fMRI provides a novel and safe approach for mapping
   effective connectivity in the human brain in a clinical setting, and
   will inform treatments for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders
   that use deep brain stimulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Topological properties and connectivity patterns in brain networks of
   patients with refractory epilepsy combined with intracranial electrical
   stimulation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {ObjectiveAlthough intracranial electrical stimulation has emerged as a
   treatment option for various diseases, its impact on the properties of
   brain networks remains challenging due to its invasive nature. The
   combination of intracranial electrical stimulation and whole-brain
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with refractory
   epilepsy (RE) makes it possible to study the network properties
   associated with electrical stimulation. Thus, our study aimed to
   investigate the brain network characteristics of RE patients with
   concurrent electrical stimulation and obtain possible clinical
   biomarkers.MethodsOur study used the GRETNA toolbox, a graph theoretical
   network analysis toolbox for imaging connectomics, to calculate and
   analyze the network topological attributes including global measures
   (small-world parameters and network efficiency) and nodal
   characteristics. The resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and the fMRI
   concurrent electrical stimulation (es-fMRI) of RE patients were utilized
   to make group comparisons with healthy controls to identify the
   differences in network topology properties. Network properties
   comparisons before and after electrode implantation in the same patient
   were used to further analyze stimulus-related changes in network
   properties. Modular analysis was used to examine connectivity and
   distribution characteristics in the brain networks of all participants
   in study.ResultsCompared to healthy controls, the rs-fMRI and the
   es-fMRI of RE patients exhibited impaired small-world property and
   reduced network efficiency. Nodal properties, such as nodal clustering
   coefficient (NCp), betweenness centrality (Bc), and degree centrality
   (Dc), exhibited differences between RE patients (including rs-fMRI and
   es-fMRI) and healthy controls. The network connectivity of RE patients
   (including rs-fMRI and es-fMRI) showed reduced intra-modular connections
   in subcortical areas and the occipital lobe, as well as decreased
   inter-modular connections between frontal and subcortical regions, and
   parieto-occipital regions compared to healthy controls. The brain
   networks of es-fMRI showed a relatively weaker small-world structure
   compared to rs-fMRI.ConclusionThe brain networks of RE patients
   exhibited a reduced small-world property, with a tendency toward random
   networks. The network connectivity patterns in RE patients exhibited
   reduced connections between cortical and subcortical regions and
   enhanced connections among parieto-occipital regions. Electrical
   stimulation can modulate brain network activity, leading to changes in
   network connectivity patterns and properties.},

Title = {Arousal Contributions to Resting-State fMRI Connectivity and Dynamics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is being
   widely used for charting brain connectivity and dynamics in healthy and
   diseased brains. However, the resting state paradigm allows an
   unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound
   effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated
   connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of
   the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in
   particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal
   modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential
   implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its
   potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state
   connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses
   are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by
   future studies.},

Abstract = {Purpose Spin-echo functional MRI (SE-fMRI) has the potential to improve
   spatial specificity when compared with gradient-echo fMRI. However, high
   spatiotemporal resolution SE-fMRI with large slice-coverage is
   challenging as SE-fMRI requires a long echo time to generate blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, leading to long repetition
   times. The aim of this work is to develop an acquisition method that
   enhances the slice-coverage of SE-fMRI at high spatiotemporal
   resolution. Theory and Methods An acquisition scheme was developed
   entitled multisection excitation by simultaneous spin-echo interleaving
   (MESSI) with complex-encoded generalized slice dithered enhanced
   resolution (cgSlider). MESSI uses the dead-time during the long echo
   time by interleaving the excitation and readout of 2 slices to enable 2x
   slice-acceleration, while cgSlider uses the stable temporal background
   phase in SE-fMRI to encode/decode 2 adjacent slices simultaneously with
   a ``phase-constrained{''} reconstruction method. The proposed
   cgSlider-MESSI was also combined with simultaneous multislice (SMS) to
   achieve further slice-acceleration. This combined approach was used to
   achieve 1.5-mm isotropic whole-brain SE-fMRI with a temporal resolution
   of 1.5 s and was evaluated using sensory stimulation and breath-hold
   tasks at 3T. Results Compared with conventional SE-SMS,
   cgSlider-MESSI-SMS provides 4-fold increase in slice-coverage for the
   same repetition time, with comparable temporal signal-to-noise ratio.
   Corresponding fMRI activation from cgSlider-MESSI-SMS for both fMRI
   tasks were consistent with those from conventional SE-SMS. Overall,
   cgSlider-MESSI-SMS achieved a 32x encoding-acceleration by combining
   R-inplane x MB x cgSlider x MESSI = 4 x 2 x 2 x 2. Conclusion
   High-quality, high-resolution whole-brain SE-fMRI was acquired at a
   short repetition time using cgSlider-MESSI-SMS. This method should be
   beneficial for high spatiotemporal resolution SE-fMRI studies requiring
   whole-brain coverage.},

Title = {Single-trial EEG-informed fMRI analysis of emotional decision problems
   in hot executive function},
Journal = {BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Executive function refers to conscious control in
   psychological process which relates to thinking and action. Emotional
   decision is a part of hot executive function and contains emotion and
   logic elements. As a kind of important social adaptation ability, more
   and more attention has been paid in recent years.
   Objective: Gambling task can be well performed in the study of emotional
   decision. As fMRI researches focused on gambling task show not
   completely consistent brain activation regions, this study adopted
   EEG-fMRI fusion technology to reveal brain neural activity related with
   feedback stimuli.
   Methods: In this study, an EEG-informed fMRI analysis was applied to
   process simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. First, relative power-spectrum
   analysis and K-means clustering method were performed separately to
   extract EEG-fMRI features. Then, Generalized linear models were
   structured using fMRI data and using different EEG features as
   regressors.
   Results: The results showed that in the win versus loss stimuli, the
   activated regions almost covered the caudate, the ventral striatum (VS),
   the orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and the cingulate. Wide activation
   areas associated with reward and punishment were revealed by the
   EEG-fMRI integration analysis than the conventional fMRI results, such
   as the posterior cingulate and the OFC. The VS and the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) were found when EEG power features were performed as
   regressors of GLM compared with results entering the amplitudes of
   feedbacK-related negativity (FRN) as regressors. Furthermore, the brain
   region activation intensity was the strongest when theta-band power was
   used as a regressor compared with the other two fusion results.
   Conclusions: The EEG-based fMRI analysis can more accurately depict the
   whole-brain activation map and analyze emotional decision problems.},

   response from standard VNS},
Journal = {ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 26},
Abstract = {Objective: In parallel to standard vagus nerve stimulation (VNS),
   microburst stimulation delivery has been developed. We evaluated the
   fMRI-related signal changes associated with standard and optimized
   microburst stimulation in a proof-of-concept study (NCT03446664).
   Methods: Twenty-nine drug-resistant epilepsy patients were prospectively
   implanted with VNS. Three 3T fMRI scans were collected 2 weeks
   postimplantation. The maximum tolerated VNS intensity was determined
   prior to each scan starting at 0.125 mA with 0.125 mA increments. FMRI
   scans were block-design with alternating 30 sec stimulation {[}ON] and
   30 sec no stimulation {[}OFF]: Scan 1 utilized standard VNS and Scan 3
   optimized microburst parameters to determine target settings.
   Semi-automated on-site fMRI data processing utilized ON-OFF block
   modeling to determine VNS-related fMRI activation per stimulation
   setting. Anatomical thalamic mask was used to derive highest mean
   thalamic t-value for determination of microburst stimulation parameters.
   Paired t-tests corrected at P < 0.05 examined differences in fMRI
   responses to each stimulation type. Results: Standard and microburst
   stimulation intensities at Scans 1 and 3 were similar (P = 0.16).
   Thalamic fMRI responses were obtained in 28 participants (19 with focal;
   9 with generalized seizures). Group activation maps showed standard VNS
   elicited thalamic activation while optimized microburst VNS showed
   widespread activation patterns including thalamus. Comparison of
   stimulation types revealed significantly greater cerebellar, midbrain,
   and parietal fMRI signal changes in microburst compared to standard VNS.
   These differences were not associated with seizure responses.
   Interpretation: While standard and optimized microburst VNS elicited
   thalamic activation, microburst also engaged other brain regions.
   Relationship between these fMRI activation patterns and clinical
   response warrants further investigation. Clinical Trial Registration:
   The study was registered with (NCT03446664).},

Title = {Imaging faster neural dynamics with fast fMRI: A need for updated models
   of the hemodynamic response},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fast fMRI enables the detection of neural dynamics over timescales of
   hundreds of milliseconds, suggesting it may provide a new avenue for
   studying subsecond neural processes in the human brain. The magnitudes
   of these fast fMRI dynamics are far greater than predicted by canonical
   models of the hemodynamic response. Several studies have established
   nonlinear properties of the hemodynamic response that have significant
   implications for fast fMRI. We first review nonlinear properties of the
   hemodynamic response function that may underlie fast fMRI signals. We
   then illustrate the breakdown of canonical hemodynamic response models
   in the context of fast neural dynamics. We will then argue that the
   canonical hemodynamic response function is not likely to reflect the
   BOLD response to neuronal activity driven by sparse or naturalistic
   stimuli or perhaps to spontaneous neuronal fluctuations in the resting
   state. These properties suggest that fast fMRI is capable of tracking
   surprisingly fast neuronal dynamics, and we discuss the neuroscientific
   questions that could be addressed using this approach.},

Title = {Effects of spatial fMRI resolution on the classification of naturalistic
   movies},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {45-55},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Studies involving multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of BOLD fMRI data
   generally attribute the success of the information-theoretic approach to
   BOLD signal contrast on the fine spatial scale of millimeters
   facilitating the classification or decoding of perceptual stimuli.
   However, to date MVPA studies that have actually explored fMRI
   resolutions at less than 2 mm voxel size are rare and limited to small
   sets of unnatural stimuli (like visual gratings) as well as specific
   sub-regions of the brain, notably the primary somatosensory cortices. To
   investigate what spatial scale best supports high information extraction
   under more general conditions this study combined naturalistic movie
   stimuli with high-resolution fMRI at 7 T and linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) of global and local BOLD signal patterns.
   Contrary to predictions, LDA and similar classifiers reached a maximum
   in classification accuracy (CA) at a smoothed resolution close to 3 mm,
   well above the 1.2 mm voxel size of the fMRI acquisition. Maximal CAs
   around 90\% were contingent upon global fMRI signal patterns comprising
   4 k-16 k of the most reactive voxels distributed sparsely throughout the
   occipital and ventro-temporal cortices. A Searchlight analysis of local
   fMRI patterns largely confirmed the global results, but also revealed a
   small subset of brain regions in early visual cortex showing limited
   increases in CA with higher resolution. Principal component analysis of
   the global and local fMRI signal patterns suggested that reproducible
   neuronal contributions were spatially auto-correlated and smooth, while
   other components of higher spatial frequency were likely related to
   physiological noise and responsible for the reduced CA at higher
   resolution. Systematic differences between experiments and subjects
   suggested that higher CA was significantly correlated with more
   consistent behavior revealed by eye tracking. Thus, the optimal
   resolution of fMRI data for MVPA was mainly limited by physiological
   noise of high spatial frequency as well as behavioral (in-)consistency.},

Title = {Intrinsic Frequencies of the Resting-State fMRI Signal: The Frequency
   Dependence of Functional Connectivity and the Effect of Mode Mixing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {The frequency characteristics of the resting-state BOLD fMRI (rs-fMRI)
   signal are of increasing scientific interest, as we discover more
   frequency-specific biological interpretations. In this work, we use
   variational mode decomposition (VMD) to precisely decompose the rs-fMRI
   time series into its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in a datadriven
   manner. The accuracy of the VMD decomposition of constituent IMFs is
   verified through simulations, with higher reconstruction accuracy and
   much-reduced mode mixing relative to previous methods. Furthermore, we
   examine the relative contribution of the VMD-derived modes (frequencies)
   to the rs-fMRI signal as well as functional connectivity measurements.
   Our primary findings are: (1) The rs-fMRI signal within the 0.01-0.25 Hz
   range can be consistently characterized by four intrinsic frequency
   clusters, centered at 0.028 Hz (IMF4), 0.080 Hz (IMF3), 0.15 Hz (IMF2)
   and 0.22 Hz (IMF1); (2) these frequency clusters were highly
   reproducible, and independent of rs-fMRI data sampling rate; (3) not all
   frequencies were associated with equivalent network topology, in
   contrast to previous findings. In fact, while IMF4 is most likely
   associated with physiological fluctuations due to respiration and pulse,
   IMF3 is most likely associated with metabolic processes, and IMF2 with
   vasomotor activity. Both IMF3 and IMF4 could produce the brain-network
   topology typically observed in fMRI, whereas IMF1 and IMF2 could not.
   These findings provide initial evidence of feasibility in decomposing
   the rs-fMRI signal into its intrinsic oscillatory frequencies in a
   reproducible manner.},

Abstract = {The contribution of astrocytes to the BOLD fMRI and DfMRI responses in
   visual cortex of mice following visual stimulation was investigated
   using TGN-020, an aquaporin 4 (AQP4) channel blocker, acting as an
   astrocyte function perturbator. Under TGN-020 injection the amplitude of
   the BOLD fMRI response became significantly higher. In contrast no
   significant changes in the DfMRI responses and the electrophysiological
   responses were observed. Those results further confirm the implications
   of astrocytes in the neurovascular coupling mechanism underlying BOLD
   fMRI, but not in the DfMRI responses which remained unsensitive to
   astrocyte function perturbation.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most
   powerful tools for investigating the human brain. The development of 7
   Tesla has played a critical role in this evolution by enabling higher
   resolution and more accurate functional maps. However, even with these
   gains, the fMRI approach is challenged relative to the spatial scale
   over which brain function is organized. Therefore, going forward,
   significant advances in fMRI are still needed. Such advances will
   predominantly come from magnetic fields significantly higher than 7
   Tesla, which is the most commonly used ultrahigh magnetic field platform
   today, and additional technologies that will include developments
   predominantly in RF coil technologies, image reconstruction, noise
   suppression, and image analysis to further enhance and augment the gains
   that can be realized by going to higher magnetic fields.},

Abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) benefits from both increased sensitivity and
   specificity with increasing magnetic field strength, making it a key
   application for Ultra-High Field (UHF) MRI scanners. Most UHF-fMRI
   studies utilize the dramatic increases in sensitivity and specificity to
   acquire high-resolution data reaching sub-millimeter scales, which
   enable new classes of experiments to probe the functional organization
   of the human brain. This review article surveys advanced data analysis
   strategies developed for high-resolution fMRI at UHF. These include
   strategies designed to mitigate distortion and artifacts associated with
   higher fields in ways that attempt to preserve spatial resolution of the
   fMRI data, as well as recently introduced analysis techniques that are
   enabled by these extremely high-resolution data. Particular focus is
   placed on anatomically-informed analyses, including cortical
   surface-based analysis, which are powerful techniques that can guide
   each step of the analysis from preprocessing to statistical analysis to
   interpretation and visualization. New intracortical analysis techniques
   for laminar and columnar fMRI are also reviewed and discussed. Prospects
   for single-subject individualized analyses are also presented and
   discussed. Altogether, there are both specific challenges and
   opportunities presented by UHF-fMRI, and the use of proper analysis
   strategies can help these valuable data reach their full potential.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective. Due to the complementary nature of electroencephalography
   (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and given the
   possibility of simultaneous acquisition, the joint data analysis can
   afford a better understanding of the underlying neural activity
   estimation. In this simulation study we want to show the benefit of the
   joint EEG-fMRI neural activity estimation in a Bayesian framework.
   Approach. We built a dynamic Bayesian framework in order to perform
   joint EEG-fMRI neural activity time course estimation. The neural
   activity is originated by a given brain area and detected by means of
   both measurement techniques. We have chosen a resting state neural
   activity situation to address the worst case in terms of the
   signal-to-noise ratio. To infer information by EEG and fMRI concurrently
   we used a tool belonging to the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods:
   the particle filter (PF). Main results. First, despite a high
   computational cost, we showed the feasibility of such an approach.
   Second, we obtained an improvement in neural activity reconstruction
   when using both EEG and fMRI measurements. Significance. The proposed
   simulation shows the improvements in neural activity reconstruction with
   EEG-fMRI simultaneous data. The application of such an approach to real
   data allows a better comprehension of the neural dynamics.},

Abstract = {Synchronous fMRI-EEG mapping of cerebral activity in stroke patients
   made it possible to implement neurofeedback, a novel and promising
   therapeutic technology. This method integrates a real-time monitoring of
   cerebral activity by EEG and fMRI signals and training of the patients
   to control this activity simultaneously or alternatively via
   neurofeedback. The targets of such cerebral stimulation are cortical
   regions controlling arbitrary movements (Brodmann area 4), whereas its
   aim is optimization of activity in these regions in order to achieve
   better rehabilitation of stroke patients. The paper discusses the
   methodical details, advantages, and promise of bimodal neurofeedback

Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is being
   increasingly used for the preoperative evaluation of patients with brain
   tumours. Methods: The study is a retrospective chart review
   investigating the use of clinical fMRI from 2002 through 2013 in the
   preoperative evaluation of brain tumour patients. Baseline demographic
   and clinical data were collected. The specific fMRI protocols used for
   each patient were recorded. Results: Sixty patients were identified over
   the 12-year period. The tumour types most commonly investigated were
   high-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade III or IV), low-grade
   glioma (World Health Organization grade II), and meningioma. Most common
   presenting symptoms were seizures (69.6\%), language deficits (23.2\%),
   and headache (19.6\%). There was a predominance of left hemispheric
   lesions investigated with fMRI (76.8\% vs 23.2\% for right). The most
   commonly involved lobes were frontal (64.3\%), temporal (33.9\%),
   parietal (21.4\%), and insular (7.1\%). The most common fMRI paradigms
   were language (83.9\%), motor (75.0\%), sensory (16.1\%), and memory
   (10.7\%). The majority of patients ultimately underwent a craniotomy
   (75.0\%), whereas smaller groups underwent stereotactic biopsy (8.9\%)
   and nonsurgical management (16.1\%). Time from request for fMRI to
   actual fMRI acquisition was 3.1 +/- 2.3 weeks. Time from fMRI
   acquisition to intervention was 4.9 +/- 5.5 weeks. Conclusions: We have
   characterized patient demographics in a retrospective single-surgeon
   cohort undergoing preoperative clinical fMRI at a Canadian centre. Our
   experience suggests an acceptable wait time from scan request to scan
   completion/analysis and from scan to intervention.},

Title = {Prospective motion correction in functional MRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {33-42},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Due to the intrinsic low sensitivity of BOLD-fMRI long scanning is
   required. Subject motion during fMRI scans reduces statistical
   significance of the activation maps and increases the prevalence of
   false activations. Motion correction is therefore an essential tool for
   a successful fMRI data analysis. Retrospective motion correction
   techniques are now commonplace and are incorporated into a wide range of
   fMRI analysis toolboxes. These techniques are advantageous due to
   robustness, sequence independence and have minimal impact on the fMRI
   study setup. Retrospective techniques however, do not provide an
   accurate intra-volume correction, nor can these techniques correct for
   the spin-history effects. The application of prospective motion
   correction in fMRI appears to be effective in reducing false positives
   and increasing sensitivity when compared to retrospective techniques,
   particularly in the cases of substantial motion. Especially advantageous
   in this regard is the combination of prospective motion correction with
   dynamic distortion correction. Nevertheless, none of the recent methods
   are able to recover activations in presence of motion that are
   comparable to no-motion conditions, which motivates further research in
   the area of adaptive dynamic imaging.},

Abstract = {The fronto-parietal attention networks have been extensively studied
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but spatiotemporal
   dynamics of these networks are not well understood. We measured
   event-related potentials (ERPs) with electroencephalography (EEG) and
   collected fMRI data from identical experiments where participants
   performed visual and auditory discrimination tasks separately or
   simultaneously and with or without distractors. To overcome the low
   temporal resolution of fMRI, we used a novel ERP-based application of
   multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) to parse
   time-averaged fMRI pattern activity into distinct spatial maps that each
   corresponded, in representational structure, to a short temporal ERP
   segment. Discriminant analysis of ERP-fMRI correlations revealed 8
   cortical networks-2 sensory, 3 attention, and 3 other-segregated by 4
   orthogonal, temporally multifaceted and spatially distributed functions.
   We interpret these functions as 4 spatiotemporal components of
   attention: modality-dependent and stimulus-driven orienting, top-down
   control, mode transition, and response preparation, selection and
   execution.},

Abstract = {Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) represents an extremely valuable
   approach for the identification of language eloquent regions for
   presurgical mapping in patients with brain tumors. However, its
   routinely application is limited by patient-related factors, such as
   cognitive disability and difficulty in coping with long-time
   acquisitions, and by technical factors, such as lack of equipment
   availability for stimuli delivery. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) instead,
   allows the identification of distinct language networks in a 10-min
   acquisition without the need of performing active tasks and using
   specific equipment. Therefore, to test the feasibility of rs-fMRI as a
   preoperative mapping tool, we reconstructed a lexico-semantic intrinsic
   connectivity network (ICN) in healthy controls (HC) and in a case series
   of patients with gliomas and compared the organization of this language
   network with the one derived from tb-fMRI in the patient's group. We
   studied three patients with extra-frontal gliomas who underwent
   functional mapping with auditory verb-generation (AVG) task and rs-fMRI
   with a seed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). First, we
   identified the functional connected areas to the IFG in HC. We
   qualitatively compared these areas with those that showed functional
   activation in AVG task derived from Neurosynth meta-analysis. Last, in
   each patient we performed single-subject analyses both for rs- and
   tb-fMRI, and we evaluated the spatial overlap between the two
   approaches. In HC, the IFG-ICN network showed a predominant left
   fronto-temporal functional connectivity in regions overlapping with the
   AVG network derived from a meta-analysis. In two patients, rs- and
   tb-fMRI showed comparable patterns of activation in left fronto-temporal
   regions, with different levels of contralateral activations. The third
   patient could not accomplish the AVG task and thus it was not possible
   to make any comparison with the ICN. However, in this patient, task-free
   approach disclosed a consistent network of fronto-temporal regions as in
   HC, and additional parietal regions. Our preliminary findings support
   the value of rs-fMRI approach for presurgical mapping, particularly for
   identifying left fronto-temporal core language-related areas in glioma
   patients. In a preoperative setting, rs-fMRI approach could represent a
   powerful tool for the identification of eloquent language areas,
   especially in patients with language or cognitive impairments.},

Title = {Template-based prediction of vigilance fluctuations in resting-state
   fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {317-327},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Changes in vigilance or alertness during a typical resting state fMRI
   scan are inevitable and have been found to affect measures of functional
   brain connectivity. Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance
   with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods
   for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study,
   conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for
   fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use
   simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same
   template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance
   fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions.
   We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between
   EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the
   previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant
   difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions,
   finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming
   the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus
   and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking
   these correlation maps as ``templates{''} for vigilance estimation, we
   found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance
   estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance
   measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We
   also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the
   overall amount of variability in a subject's vigilance state, and that
   the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as
   a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based
   approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the
   amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and
   tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.},

Abstract = {Declines in processing speed performance occur in aging and are a
   critical marker of functional independence in older adults. Numerous
   studies suggest that Useful Field of View (UFOV) training may ameliorate
   cognitive decline in older adults. Despite its efficacy, little is known
   about the neural correlates of this task. The current study is the first
   to investigate the coherence of functional connectivity during UFOV task
   completion. A total of 336 participants completed the UFOV task while
   undergoing task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ten
   spherical regions of interest (ROIs), selected a priori, were created
   based on regions with the greatest peak BOLD activation patterns in the
   UFOV fMRI task and regions that have been shown to significantly relate
   to UFOV fMRI task performance. We used a weighted ROI-to-ROI
   connectivity analysis to model task-specific functional connectivity
   strength between these a priori selected ROIs. We found that our UFOV
   fMRI network was functionally connected during task performance and was
   significantly associated to UFOV fMRI task performance. Within-network
   connectivity of the UFOV fMRI network showed comparable or better
   predictive power in accounting for UFOV accuracy compared to 7 resting
   state networks, delineated by Yeo and colleagues. Finally, we
   demonstrate that the within-network connectivity of UFOV fMRI task
   accounted for scores on a measure of ``near transfer{''}, the Double
   Decision task, better than the aforementioned resting state networks.
   Our data elucidate functional connectivity patterns of the UFOV fMRI
   task. This may assist in future targeted interventions that aim to
   improve synchronicity within the UFOV fMRI network.},

Abstract = {Since its discovery in the early 1990s, functional MRI (fMRI) has been
   used to study human brain function. One well-established application of
   fMRI in the clinical setting is the neurosurgical planning of patients
   with brain tumors near eloquent cortical areas. Clinical fMRI aims to
   preoperatively identify eloquent cortices that serve essential functions
   in daily life, such as hand movement and language. The primary goal of
   neurosurgery is to maximize tumor resection while sparing eloquent
   cortices adjacent to the tumor. When a lesion presents in the vicinity
   of an eloquent cortex, surgeons may use fMRI to plan their best surgical
   approach by determining the proximity of the lesion to regions of
   activation, providing guidance for awake brain surgery and
   intraoperative brain mapping. The acquisition of fMRI requires patient
   preparation prior to imaging, determination of functional paradigms,
   monitoring of patient performance, and both processing and analysis of
   images. Interpretation of fMRI maps requires a strong understanding of
   functional neuroanatomy and familiarity with the technical limitations
   frequently present in brain tumor imaging, including neurovascular
   uncoupling, patient compliance, and data analysis. This review discusses
   clinical fMRI in neuro-oncology, relevant ongoing research topics, and
   prospective future developments in this exciting discipline. (c) RSNA,

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe aimed to evaluate the contribution of simultaneous recording
   of electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (EEG-fMRI) in the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome, localization of the
   epileptogenic zone (EZ), and decision-making regarding surgical
   treatment.MethodsWe performed a retrospective study to evaluate patients
   with focal epilepsy who underwent EEG-fMRI. Two evaluators assessed
   epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy and defined
   confidence levels. They assessed these clinical characteristics first
   without EEG-fMRI and then including EEG-fMRI to assess how the results
   of EEG-fMRI changed the evaluations. We also determined how the clinical
   evaluation was affected by the concordance level between the blood
   oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and the presumed focus location,
   and by the confidence level of the BOLD response itself based on the
   t-value of the primary and secondary clusters.ResultsFifty-one scans
   from 48 patients were included. The BOLD map affected 66.7\% of the
   evaluations by altering evaluation items (epilepsy syndrome, presumed
   focus, or surgical candidacy) or their confidence levels. EEG-fMRI
   results increased the confidence levels of epilepsy syndrome, presumed
   focus, or surgical candidacy in 47.1\% of patients but reduced clinical
   confidence in these features in 11.8\%. More specifically, the
   confidence levels increased for epilepsy syndrome in 28.5\%,
   identification of presumed focus in 33.9\%, and determination of
   surgical candidacy in 29.4\%. The BOLD signal confidence level, whether
   high or low, did not influence these clinical
   factors.SignificancePrevious studies have emphasized the utility of
   EEG-fMRI for the localization of the epileptogenic zone. This study
   demonstrated the potential of EEG-fMRI to influence clinical confidence
   when determining epilepsy syndrome, the presumed epileptic focus, and
   surgical candidacy.},

Title = {Brain functional BOLD perturbation modelling for forward fMRI and
   inverse mapping},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To computationally separate dynamic brain functional BOLD responses from
   static background in a brain functional activity for forward fMRI signal
   analysis and inverse mapping.
   Methods
   A brain functional activity is represented in terms of magnetic source
   by a perturbation model chi = chi(0) + delta(chi), with d. for BOLD
   magnetic perturbations and. chi(0) for background. A brain fMRI
   experiment produces a timeseries of complex-valued images (T2{*}
   images), whereby we extract the BOLD phase signals (denoted by delta P)
   by a complex division. By solving an inverse problem, we reconstruct the
   BOLD delta chi dataset from the delta P dataset, and the brain.
   distribution from a (unwrapped) T2{*} phase image. Given a 4D dataset of
   task BOLD fMRI, we implement brain functional mapping by temporal
   correlation analysis.
   Results
   Through a high-field (7T) and high-resolution (0.5mm in plane) task fMRI
   experiment, we demonstrated in detail the BOLD perturbation model for
   fMRI phase signal separation (P + delta P) and reconstructing intrinsic
   brain magnetic source (chi and delta chi). We also provided to a
   low-field (3T) and low-resolution (2mm) task fMRI experiment in support
   of single-subject fMRI study. Our experiments show that the delta
   chi-depicted functional map reveals bidirectional BOLD. perturbations
   during the task performance.
   Conclusions
   The BOLD perturbation model allows us to separate fMRI phase signal (by
   complex division) and to perform inverse mapping for pure BOLD delta chi
   reconstruction for intrinsic functional. mapping. The full brain.
   reconstruction (from unwrapped fMRI phase) provides a new brain tissue
   image that allows to scrutinize the brain tissue idiosyncrasy for the
   pure BOLD delta chi response through an automatic function/structure
   co-localization.},

Abstract = {Generalized Fixation-off Sensitivity (CGE-FoS) patients present abnormal
   EEG patterns when losing fixation. In the present work, we studied two
   CGE-FoS epileptic patients with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. We aim to
   identify brain areas that are specifically related to the pathology by
   identifying the brain networks that are related to the EEG brain altered
   rhythms. Three main analyses were performed: EEG standalone, where the
   voltage fluctuations in delta, alpha, and beta EEG bands were obtained;
   fMRI standalone, where resting-state fMRI ICA analyses for opened and
   closed eyes conditions were computed per subject; and, EEG-informed
   fMRI, where EEG delta, alpha and beta oscillations were used to analyze
   fMRI. Patient 1 showed EEG abnormalities for lower beta band EEG brain
   rhythm. Fluctuations of this rhythm were correlated with a brain network
   mainly composed by temporo-frontal areas only found in the closed eyes
   condition. Patient 2 presented alterations in all the EEG brain rhythms
   (delta, alpha, beta) under study when closing eyes. Several biologically
   relevant brain networks highly correlated (r>0.7) to each other in the
   closed eyes condition were found. EEG-informed fMRI results in patient 2
   showed hypersynchronized patterns in the fMRI correlation spatial maps.
   The obtained findings allow a differential diagnosis for each patient
   and different profiles with respect to healthy volunteers. The results
   suggest a different disruption in the functional brain networks of these
   patients that depends on their altered brain rhythms. This knowledge
   could be used to treat these patients by novel brain stimulation
   approaches targeting specific altered brain networks in each patient.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},

Volume = {185},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Resting state brain activity has become a significant area of
   investigation in human neuroimaging. An important approach for
   understanding the dynamics of neuronal activity in the resting state is
   to use complementary imaging modalities. Electrophysiological recordings
   can access fast temporal dynamics, while functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) studies reveal detailed spatial patterns. However, the
   relationship between these two measures is not fully established. In
   this study, we used simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG)
   and fMRI, along with Hidden Markov Modelling, to investigate how network
   dynamics at fast sub-second time-scales, accessible with EEG, link to
   the slower time-scales and higher spatial detail of fMRI. We found that
   the fMRI correlates of fast transient EEG dynamic networks show highly
   reproducible spatial patterns, and that their spatial organization
   exhibits strong similarity with traditional fMRI resting state networks
   maps. This further demonstrates the potential of electrophysiology as a
   tool for understanding the fast network dynamics that underlie fMRI
   resting state networks.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have
   been used to reconstruct cognitive states based on brain activity evoked
   by sensory or cognitive stimuli. To date, such decoding paradigms were
   mostly used for visual modalities. On the other hand, reconstructing
   functional brain activity in motor areas was primarily achieved through
   more invasive electrophysiological techniques. Here, we investigated
   whether non-invasive fMRI responses from human motor cortex can also be
   used to predict individual arm movements. To this end, we conducted fMRI
   studies in which participants moved their arm from a center position to
   one of eight target directions. Our results suggest that arm movement
   directions can be distinguished from the multivoxel patterns of fMRI
   responses in motor cortex. Furthermore, compared to multivoxel pattern
   analysis, encoding models were able to also reconstruct unknown movement
   directions from the predicted brain activity. We conclude for our study
   that non-invasive fMRI signal can be utilized to predict directional
   motor movements in human motor cortex.},

   Reading},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {When reading a narrative text, both the dorsal and ventral visual
   systems are activated. To illustrate the patterns of interactions
   between the dorsal and ventral visual systems in text reading, we
   conducted analyses of functional connectivity (FC) and effective
   connectivity (EC) in a left-hemispheric network for reading-driven
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) data. In reading-driven fMRI (Experiment 1), we found
   significant FCs among the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left
   intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the visual word form area (VWFA), and
   there were topdown effects from the left MFG to the left IPS, from the
   left MFG to the VWFA, and from the left IPS to the VWFA. In rs-fMRI
   (Experiment 2), we identified FCs and ECs for MFG-IPS and IPS-VWFA
   connections. In addition, the brainbehavior relationship in resting
   states showed that the dorsal connection was more associated with
   reading fluency relative to lexical decision. The combination of two
   experiments revealed that the MFG-IPS and the VWFA-IPS connections were
   shared connections both in reading-driven fMRI and rs-fMRI, and that the
   MFG-VWFA was specific connectivity in reading-driven fMRI. These results
   suggest that topdown effects from the dorsal visual system to ventral
   visual system play an important role in text reading.},

Title = {Accuracy analysis of fMRI and MEG activations determined by
   intraoperative mapping},
Journal = {NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE By looking at how the accuracy of preoperative brain mapping
   methods vary according to differences in the distance from the
   activation clusters used for the analysis, the present study aimed to
   elucidate how preoperative functional neuroimaging may be used in such a
   way that maximizes the mapping accuracy.
   METHODS The eloquent function of 19 patients with a brain tumor or
   cavernoma was mapped prior to resection with both functional MRI (fMRI)
   and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The mapping results were then
   validated using direct cortical stimulation mapping performed
   immediately after craniotomy and prior to resection. The subset of
   patients with equivalent MEG and fMRI tasks performed for motor (n = 14)
   and language (n = 12) were evaluated as both individual and combined
   predictions. Furthermore, the distance resulting in the maximum
   accuracy, as evaluated by the J statistic, was determined by plotting
   the sensitivities and specificities against a linearly increasing
   distance threshold.
   RESULTS fMRI showed a maximum mapping accuracy at 5 mm for both motor
   and language mapping. MEG showed a maximum mapping accuracy at 40 mm for
   motor and 15 mm for language mapping. At the standard 10-mm distance
   used in the literature, MEG showed a greater specificity than fMRI for
   both motor and language mapping but a lower sensitivity for motor
   mapping. Combining MEG and fMRI showed a maximum accuracy at 15 mm and 5
   mm-MEG and fMRI distances, respectively-for motor mapping and at a 10-mm
   distance for both MEG and fMRI for language mapping. For motor mapping,
   combining MEG and fMRI at the optimal distances resulted in a greater
   accuracy than the maximum accuracy of the individual predictions.
   CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that the accuracy of language and
   motor mapping for both fMRI and MEG is heavily dependent on the distance
   threshold used in the analysis. Furthermore, combining MEG and fMRI
   showed the potential for increased motor mapping accuracy compared to
   when using the modalities separately.},

Title = {Multimodal Classification of Schizophrenia Patients with MEG and fMRI
   Data Using Static and Dynamic Connectivity Measures},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Mental disorders like schizophrenia are currently diagnosed by
   physicians/psychiatrists through clinical assessment and their
   evaluation of patient's self-reported experiences as the illness
   emerges. There is great interest in identifying biological markers of
   prognosis at the onset of illness, rather than relying on the evolution
   of symptoms across time. Functional network connectivity, which
   indicates a subject's overall level of ``synchronicity{''} of activity
   between brain regions, demonstrates promise in providing individual
   subject predictive power. Many previous studies reported functional
   connectivity changes during resting-state using only functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Nevertheless, exclusive reliance on fMRI to
   generate such networks may limit the inference of the underlying
   dysfunctional connectivity, which is hypothesized to be a factor in
   patient symptoms, as fMRI measures connectivity via hemodynamics.
   Therefore, combination of connectivity assessments using fMRI and
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), which more directly measures neuronal
   activity, may provide improved classification of schizophrenia than
   either modality alone. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that metrics
   of dynamic connectivity may also be critical for understanding pathology
   in schizophrenia. In this work, we propose a new framework for
   extraction of important disease related features and classification of
   patients with schizophrenia based on using both fMRI and MEG to
   investigate functional network components in the resting state. Results
   of this study show that the integration of fMRI and MEG provides
   important information that captures fundamental characteristics of
   functional network connectivity in schizophrenia and is helpful for
   prediction of schizophrenia patient group membership. Combined fMRI/MEG
   methods, using static functional network connectivity analyses, improved
   classification accuracy relative to use of fMRI or MEG methods alone (by
   15 and 12.45\%, respectively), while combined fMRI/MEG methods using
   dynamic functional network connectivity analyses improved classification
   up to 5.12\% relative to use of fMRI alone and up to 17.21\% relative to
   use of MEG alone.},

Abstract = {Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) could simultaneously obtain both functional MRI (fMRI) and
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and thus provide multiparametric
   information for the analysis of brain metabolism. In this study, we
   aimed to, for the first time, investigate the interplay of simultaneous
   fMRI and FDG PET scan using a randomized self-control protocol. In
   total, 24 healthy volunteers underwent PET/MRI scan for 30-40 min after
   the injection of FDG. A 22-min brain scan was separated into MRI-off
   mode (without fMRI pulsing) and MRI-on mode (with fMRI pulsing), with
   each one lasting for 11 min. We calculated the voxel-wise fMRI metrics
   (regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations,
   fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and degree
   centrality), resting networks, relative standardized uptake value ratios
   (SUVr), SUVr slope, and regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose
   (rCMRGlu) maps. Paired two-sample t-tests were applied to assess the
   statistical differences between SUVr, SUVr slope, correlation
   coefficients of fMRI metrics, and rCMRGlu between MRI-off and MRI-on
   modes, respectively. The voxel-wise whole-brain SUVr revealed no
   statistical difference (P > 0.05), while the SUVr slope was
   significantly elevated in sensorimotor, dorsal attention, ventral
   attention, control, default, and auditory networks (P < 0.05) during
   fMRI scan. The task-based group independent-component analysis revealed
   that the most active network components derived from the combined
   MRI-off and MRI-on static PET images were frontal pole, superior frontal
   gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and occipital pole. High correlation
   coefficients were found among fMRI metrics with rCMRGlu in both MRI-off
   and MRI-on mode (P < 0.05). Our results systematically evaluated the
   impact of simultaneous fMRI scan on the quantification of human brain
   metabolism from an integrated PET/MRI system.},

Abstract = {EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI (EEG-fMRI) is a multimodal method
   that has shown promise in mapping the seizure onset zone in patients
   with focal epilepsy. However, there are many instances when this method
   is unsuccessful or not applicable, and other data driven fMRI methods
   may be utilized. One such method is the two-dimensional temporal
   clustering analysis (2dTCA). In this study we compared the classic
   EEG-fMRI and 2dTCA performance in mapping regions related to the seizure
   onset region in 18 focal epilepsy patients (12 presenting interictal
   epileptiform discharges (IEDs), during EEG-fMRI acquisition) with Engel
   I or II surgical outcome. Activation maps of both 2dTCA timing outputs
   (positive and negative histograms) and EEG detected IEDs were computed
   and compared to the region of epilepsy surgical resection. Patients were
   evaluated in three categories based on frequency of EEG detected spiking
   during the MRI. EEG-fMRI maps were concordant to the epilepsy region in
   5/12 subjects, four with frequent IEDs on EEG. The 2dTCA was successful
   in mapping 13/18 patients including 3/6 with no IEDs detected (10/12
   with IEDs detected). The epilepsy-related activities were successfully
   mapped by both methods in only 4/12 patients. This work suggests that
   the epilepsy-related information detected by each method may be
   different: while EEG-fMRI is more accurate in patients with high rather
   than lower numbers of EEG detected IEDs; 2dTCA can be useful in
   evaluating patients even when no concurrent EEG spikes are detected or
   EEG-fMRI is not effective. Therefore, our results support that 2dTCA
   might be an alternative for mapping epilepsy-related BOLD activity in
   negative EEG-fMRI (6/7 patients) and spike-less patients.},

Abstract = {EEG-fMRI has gained increasing importance in epilepsy pre-surgical
   diagnosis. However, 40-70\% of EEG-fMRI recordings in patients lack
   interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during the scan, which could
   be overcome by detecting matching topography maps. We tried to validate
   this method in clinical settings taking various electroclinical factors
   into consideration. Eleven patients who had undergone EEG-fMRI during
   pre-surgical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy and who had had
   clinical long-term video-EEG were studied. Spike-related blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) maps were created using IEDs occurring during the
   EEG-fMRI scan. Separate maps were then generated from IEDs marked on the
   clinical long-term EEG recordings, which were averaged to produce
   topographical IED maps and correlated with the EEGs recorded inside the
   scanner yielding a correlation coefficient time course. Epileptogenic
   zones were defined by an expert panel during pre-surgical evaluation and
   validated by an epilepsy surgery resulting in a good outcome. Both
   techniques' performance was evaluated according to factors including
   arousal during IED recording, IED topography and lateralization, lesion
   type, and localization. Topography-related EEG-fMRI yielded more
   specific results compared to the spike-related method. Superficial
   lesion location and ipsilateral IED seem to result in a higher
   concordance of BOLD maps. The polarity of BOLD responses may be
   lesion-dependent, and both positive and negative BOLD changes may be
   associated with the irritative zone. Topography-related EEG-fMRI may
   show improved specificity especially for superficial lesions producing
   ipsilateral spikes. This method can be used as an alternative either in
   the absence of spikes during the simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition or to
   sharpen a diffusely activated BOLD-map.},

Abstract = {The complexity and variability of human brain activity, such as
   quantified from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time
   series, have been widely studied as potential markers of healthy and
   pathological states. However, the extent to which fMRI temporal features
   exhibit stable markers of inter-individual differences in brain function
   across healthy young adults is currently an open question. In this
   study, we draw upon two widely used time-series measures-a nonlinear
   complexity measure (sample entropy; SampEn) and a spectral measure of
   low-frequency content (fALFF)-to capture dynamic properties of
   resting-state fMRI in a large sample of young adults from the Human
   Connectome Project. We observe that these two measures are closely
   related, and that both generate reproducible patterns across brain
   regions over four different fMRI runs, with intra-class correlations of
   up to 0.8. Moreover, we find that both metrics can uniquely
   differentiate subjects with high identification rates (ca. 89\%).
   Canonical correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship
   between multivariate brain temporal features and behavioral measures.
   Overall, these findings suggest that regional profiles of fMRI temporal
   characteristics may provide stable markers of individual differences,
   and motivate future studies to further probe relationships between fMRI
   time series metrics and behavior.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that both electroencephalography (EEG)
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) features can be used to
   estimate memory load. The influence of sample set construction on the
   estimation performance and the benefit of combining EEG and fMRI
   features remain unclear. In this study, we extracted spectral power and
   event-related-potentials from the Pz electrode and 9 electrodes in
   related lobes as the EEG feature and extracted the beta values of the
   activation brain regions as the fMRI feature at the two sample set
   construction levels of trial and run. Then we combined EEG and fMRI
   features. The results showed that the classification performance of
   memory load at the run level got higher classification accuracy when
   using rapid event-related experimental design. As for EEG features, the
   classification performance of memory load was related to channel
   selection. The combination of EEG and fMRI features did not contribute
   to load classification accuracy.},

Abstract = {Standard functional MRI (fMRI), which includes resting-state or
   paradigm-driven designs, is widely used in studies of brain function,
   aging, and disease. These fMRI studies typically use two-dimensional
   gradient echo-planar imaging, which inherently contains phase data that
   enables quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). This work focuses on
   the dual value of QSM within fMRI studies, by providing both a localized
   analysis of functional changes in activated tissue, and iron-sensitive
   structural maps in deep grey matter (DGM). Using a visual paradigm fMRI
   study on healthy volunteers at clinical (1.5 T) and high field strength
   (4.7 T), we perform functional analysis of magnitude andQSMtime series,
   andat thesametime harness structuralQSMof iron-richDGM, including globus
   pallidus, putamen, caudate head, substantia nigra, and red nucleus. The
   effects of fMRI spatial resolution and time series variation on
   structuralDGMQSMare investigated. Ourresults indicate that
   structuralDGMQSMis feasible within existing fMRI studies, provided that
   the voxel dimensions are equal to or less than3 mm, with higher
   resolutions preferred. ThemeanDGM QSMvalues were about 40 to 220 ppb,
   while the interquartile ranges of theDGMQSMtime series varied from about
   3 to 9 ppb, depending on structure and resolution. In contrast, the peak
   voxel functional QSM (fQSM) changes in activated visual cortex ranged
   from about -10 to -30 ppb, and functional clusters were consistently
   smaller on QSM than magnitude fMRI. Mean-levelDGMQSMof the time series
   was successfully extracted in all cases, while fQSMresults were
   moreprone to residual background fields and showed less functional
   change compared with standard magnitude fMRI. Under the conditions
   prescribed, standard fMRI studiesmaybe used for robust mean-levelDGMQSM,
   enabling study of DGM iron accumulation, in addition to functional
   analysis. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Precise localization of epileptic foci is an unavoidable prerequisite in
   epilepsy surgery. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording has recently created
   new horizons to locate foci in patients with epilepsy and, in comparison
   with single-modality methods, has yielded more promising results
   although it is still subject to limitations such as lack of access to
   information between interictal events. This study assesses its potential
   added value in the presurgical evaluation of patients with complex
   source localization. Adult candidates considered ineligible for surgery
   on account of an unclear focus and/or presumed multifocality on the
   basis of EEG underwent EEG-fMRI. Adopting a component-based approach,
   this study attempts to identify the neural behavior of the epileptic
   generators and detect the components-of-interest which will later be
   used as input in the GLM model, substituting the classical linear
   regressor. Twenty-eight sets interictal epileptiform discharges (IED)
   from nine patients were analyzed. In eight patients, at least one BOLD
   response was significant, positive and topographically related to the
   IEDs. These patients were rejected for surgery because of an unclear
   focus in four, presumed multifocality in three, and a combination of the
   two conditions in two. Component-based EEG-fMRI improved localization in
   five out of six patients with unclear foci. In patients with presumed
   multifocality, component-based EEG-fMRI advocated one of the foci in
   five patients and confirmed multifocality in one of the patients. In
   seven patients, component-based EEG-fMRI opened new prospects for
   surgery and in two of these patients, intracranial EEG supported the
   EEG-fMRI results. In these complex cases, component-based EEG-fMRI
   either improved source localization or corroborated a negative decision
   regarding surgical candidacy. As supported by the statistical findings,
   the developed EEG-fMRI method leads to a more realistic estimation of
   localization compared to the conventional EEG-fMRI approach, making it a
   tool of high value in pre-surgical evaluation of patients with
   refractory epilepsy. To ensure proper implementation, we have included
   guidelines for the application of component-based EEG-fMRI in clinical
   practice.},

Title = {Characterizing Spatiotemporal Population Receptive Fields in Human
   Visual Cortex with fMRI},

Abstract = {The use of fMRI and computational modeling has advanced understanding of
   spatial characteristics of population receptive fields (pRFs) in human
   visual cortex. However, we know relatively little about the
   spatiotemporal characteristics of pRFs because neurons' temporal
   properties are one to two orders of magnitude faster than fMRI BOLD
   responses. Here, we developed an image-computable framework to estimate
   spatiotemporal pRFs from fMRI data. First, we developed a simulation
   software that predicts fMRI responses to a time-varying visual input
   given a spatiotemporal pRF model and solves the model parameters. The
   simulator revealed that ground-truth spatiotemporal parameters can be
   accurately recovered at the millisecond resolution from synthesized fMRI
   responses. Then, using fMRI and a novel stimulus paradigm, we mapped
   spatiotemporal pRFs in individual voxels across human visual cortex in
   10 participants (both females and males). We find that a compressive
   spatiotemporal (CST) pRF model better explains fMRI responses than a
   conventional spatial pRF model across visual areas spanning the dorsal,
   lateral, and ventral streams. Further, we find three organizational
   principles of spatiotemporal pRFs: (1) from early to later areas within
   a visual stream, spatial and temporal windows of pRFs progressively
   increase in size and show greater compressive nonlinearities, (2) later
   visual areas show diverging spatial and temporal windows across streams,
   and (3) within early visual areas (V1-V3), both spatial and temporal
   windows systematically increase with eccentricity. Together, this
   computational framework and empirical results open exciting new
   possibilities for modeling and measuring fine-grained spatiotemporal
   dynamics of neural responses using fMRI.},

Title = {Consistency and similarity of MEG- and fMRI-signal time courses during
   movie viewing},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},

Volume = {173},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Movie viewing allows human perception and cognition to be studied in
   complex, real-life-like situations in a brain-imaging laboratory.
   Previous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   with magneto-and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) have demonstrated
   consistent temporal dynamics of brain activity across movie viewers.
   However, little is known about the similarities and differences of fMRI
   and MEG or EEG dynamics during such naturalistic situations.
   We thus compared MEG and fMRI responses to the same 15-min
   black-and-white movie in the same eight subjects who watched the movie
   twice during both MEG and fMRI recordings. We analyzed intra-and
   intersubject voxel-wise correlations within each imaging modality as
   well as the correlation of the MEG envelopes and fMRI signals. The fMRI
   signals showed voxel-wise within-and between-subjects correlations up to
   r = 0.66 and r = 0.37, respectively, whereas these correlations were
   clearly weaker for the envelopes of band-pass filtered (7 frequency
   bands below 100 Hz) MEG signals (within-subjects correlation r < 0.14
   and between-subjects r < 0.05). Direct MEG-fMRI voxel-wise correlations
   were unreliable. Notably, applying a spatial-filtering approach to the
   MEG data uncovered consistent canonical variates that showed
   considerably stronger (up to r = 0.25) between-subjects correlations
   than the univariate voxel-wise analysis. Furthermore, the envelopes of
   the time courses of these variates up to about 10 Hz showed association
   with fMRI signals in a general linear model. Similarities between
   envelopes of MEG canonical variates and fMRI voxel time-courses were
   seen mostly in occipital, but also in temporal and frontal brain
   regions, whereas intra-and intersubject correlations for MEG and fMRI
   separately were strongest only in the occipital areas.
   In contrast to the conventional univariate analysis, the
   spatial-filtering approach was able to uncover associations between the
   MEG envelopes and fMRI time courses, shedding light on the similarities
   of hemodynamic and electromagnetic brain activities during movie
   viewing.},

Title = {Physiological noise modeling in fMRI based on the pulsatile component of
   photoplethysmograph},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {242},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism allows
   the noninvasive monitoring of changes in deoxyhemoglobin content. As
   such, it is commonly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to study brain activity since levels of deoxyhemoglobin are
   indirectly related to local neuronal activity through neurovascular
   coupling mechanisms. However, the BOLD signal is severely affected by
   physiological processes as well as motion. Due to this, several noise
   correction techniques have been developed to correct for the associated
   confounds. The present study focuses on cardiac pulsatility fMRI
   confounds, aiming to refine model-based techniques that utilize the
   photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal. Specifically, we propose a new
   technique based on convolution filtering, termed cardiac pulsatility
   model (CPM) and compare its performance with the cardiac-related
   RETROICOR (Card-RETROICOR), which is a technique commonly used to model
   fMRI fluctuations due to cardiac pulsatility. Further, we investigate
   whether variations in the amplitude of the PPG pulses (PPG-Amp) covary
   with variations in amplitude of pulse-related fMRI fluctuations, as well
   as with the systemic low frequency oscillations (SLFOs) component of the
   fMRI global signal (GS - defined as the mean signal across all gray
   matter voxels). Capitalizing on 3T fMRI data from the Human Connectome
   Project, CPM was found to explain a significantly larger fraction of the
   fMRI signal variance compared to Card-RETROICOR, particularly for
   subjects with larger heart rate variability during the scan. The
   amplitude of the fMRI pulse-related fluctuations did not covary with
   PPG-Amp; however, PPG-Amp explained significant variance in the GS that
   was not attributed to variations in heart rate or breathing patterns.
   Our results suggest that the proposed approach can model high-frequency
   fluctuations due to pulsation as well as low-frequency physiological
   fluctuations more accurately compared to model-based techniques commonly
   employed in fMRI studies.},

Title = {Model-based physiological noise removal in fast fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {205},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Recent improvements in the speed and sensitivity of fMRI acquisition
   techniques suggest that fast fMRI can be used to detect and precisely
   localize sub-second neural dynamics. This enhanced temporal resolution
   has enormous potential for neuroscientists. However, physiological noise
   poses a major challenge for the analysis of fast fMRI data.
   Physiological noise scales with sensitivity, and its autocorrelation
   structure is altered in rapidly sampled data, suggesting that new
   approaches are needed for physiological noise removal in fast fMRI.
   Existing strategies either rely on external physiological recordings,
   which can be noisy or difficult to collect, or employ data-driven
   approaches which make assumptions that may not hold true in fast fMRI.
   We created a statistical model of harmonic regression with
   autoregressive noise (HRAN) to estimate and remove cardiac and
   respiratory noise from the fMRI signal directly. This technique exploits
   the fact that cardiac and respiratory noise signals are fully sampled
   (rather than aliasing) when imaging at fast rates, allowing us to track
   and model physiology over time without requiring external physiological
   measurements. We then created a joint model of neural hemodynamics, and
   physiological and autocorrelated noise to more accurately remove noise.
   We first verified that HRAN accurately estimates cardiac and respiratory
   dynamics and that our model demonstrates goodness-of-fit in fast fMRI
   data. In task-driven data, we then demonstrated that HRAN is able to
   remove physiological noise while leaving the neural signal intact,
   thereby increasing detection of task-driven voxels. Finally, we
   established that in both simulations and fast fMRI data HRAN is able to
   improve statistical inferences as compared with gold-standard
   physiological noise removal techniques. In conclusion, we created a tool
   that harnesses the novel information in fast fMRI to remove
   physiological noise, enabling broader use of the technology to study
   human brain function.},

   PET},

Abstract = {Purpose Patients with Moyamoya Angiopathy (MMA) require hemodynamic
   assessment to evaluate the risk of stroke. Hemodynamic evaluation by use
   of breath-hold-triggered fMRI (bh-fMRI) was proposed as a readily
   available alternative to the diagnostic standard {[}O-15]water PET.
   Recent studies suggest voxel-wise hemodynamic delay correction in
   hypercapnia-triggered fMRI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effect of delay correction of bh-fMRI in patients with MMA and to
   compare the results with {[}O-15]water PET.
   Methods bh-fMRI data sets of 22 patients with MMA were evaluated without
   and with voxel-wise delay correction within different shift ranges and
   compared to the corresponding {[}O-15]water PET data sets. The effects
   were evaluated combined and in subgroups of data sets with most severely
   impaired CVR (apparent steal phenomenon), data sets with territorial
   time delay, and data sets with neither steal phenomenon nor delay
   between vascular territories.
   Results The study revealed a high mean cross-correlation (r = 0.79, p <
   0.001) between bh-fMRI and {[}O-15]water PET. The correlation was
   strongly dependent on the choice of the shift range. Overall, no shift
   range revealed a significantly improved correlation between bh-fMRI and
   {[}O-15]water PET compared to the correlation without delay correction.
   Delay correction within shift ranges with positive high high cutoff
   revealed a lower agreement between bh-fMRI and PET overall and in all
   subgroups.
   Conclusion Voxel-wise delay correction, in particular with shift ranges
   with high cutoff, should be used critically as it can lead to
   false-negative results in regions with impaired CVR and a lower
   correlation to the diagnostic standard {[}O-15]water PET.},

Title = {An fMRI-compatible system for targeted electrical stimulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {378},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background: Neuromodulation is a rapidly expanding therapeutic option
   considered within neuropsychiatry, pain and rehabilitation therapy.
   Combining electrostimulation with feedback from fMRI can provide
   information about the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects, but
   so far, such studies have been hampered by the lack of technology to
   conduct safe and accurate experiments. Here we present a system for fMRI
   compatible electrical stimulation, and the first proof-of-concept
   neuroimaging data with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in pigs obtained
   with the device.New method: The system consists of two modules, placed
   in the control and scanner room, connected by optical fiber. The system
   also connects to the MRI scanner to timely initiate the stimulation
   sequence at start of scan. We evaluated the system in four pigs with DBS
   in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) while we acquired BOLD responses in the
   STN and neocortex.Results: We found that the system delivered robust
   electrical stimuli to the implanted electrode in sync with the
   preprogrammed fMRI sequence. All pigs displayed a DBS-STN induced
   neocortical BOLD response, but none in the STN.Comparisons with existing
   method: The system solves three major problems related to electric
   stimuli and fMRI examinations, namely preventing distortion of the fMRI
   signal, enabling communication that synchronize the experimental
   conditions, and surmounting the safety hazards caused by interference
   with the MRI scanner. Conclusions: The fMRI compatible electrical
   stimulator circumvents previous problems related to electroceuticals and
   fMRI. The system allows flexible modifications for fMRI designs and
   stimulation parameters, and can be customized to electroceutical
   applications beyond DBS.},

Title = {Challenges and Perspectives of Mapping Locus Coeruleus Activity in the
   Rodent with High-Resolution fMRI},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the most commonly studied brainstem
   nuclei when investigating brain-behavior associations. The LC serves as
   a major brainstem relay for both ascending bottom-up and descending
   top-down projections. Specifically, noradrenergic (NA) LC neurons not
   only connect globally to higher-order subcortical nuclei and cortex to
   mediate arousal and attention but also directly project to other
   brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord to control autonomic function.
   Despite the extensive investigation of LC function using
   electrophysiological recordings and cellular/molecular imaging for both
   cognitive research and the contribution of LC to different pathological
   states, the role of neuroimaging to investigate LC function has been
   restricted. For instance, it remains challenging to identify LC-specific
   activation with functional MRI (fMRI) in animal models, due to the small
   size of this nucleus. Here, we discuss the complexity of fMRI
   applications toward LC activity mapping in mouse brains by highlighting
   the technological challenges. Further, we introduce a single-vessel fMRI
   mapping approach to elucidate the vascular specificity of
   high-resolution fMRI signals coupled to LC activation in the mouse
   brainstem.},

Title = {Investigating mechanisms of fast BOLD responses: The effects of stimulus
   intensity and of spatial heterogeneity of hemodynamics},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {245},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that fast fMRI can track neural
   activity well above the temporal limit predicted by the canonical
   hemodynamic response model. While these findings are promising, the
   biophysical mechanisms underlying these fast fMRI phenomena remain
   underexplored. In this study, we discuss two aspects of the hemodynamic
   response, complementary to several existing hypotheses, that can
   accommodate faster fMRI dynamics beyond those predicted by the canonical
   model. First, we demonstrate, using both visual and somatosensory
   paradigms, that the timing and shape of hemodynamic response functions
   (HRFs) vary across graded levels of stimulus intensity -with
   lower-intensity stimulation eliciting faster and narrower HRFs. Second,
   we show that as the spatial resolution of fMRI increases, voxel-wise
   HRFs begin to deviate from the canonical model, with a considerable
   portion of voxels exhibiting faster temporal dynamics than predicted by
   the canonical HRF. Collectively, both stimulus/task intensity and image
   resolution can affect the sensitivity of fMRI to fast brain activity,
   which may partly explain recent observations of fast fMRI signals. It is
   further noteworthy that, while the present investigations focus on fast
   neural responses, our findings suggest that a revised hemodynamic model
   may benefit the many fMRI studies using paradigms with wide ranges of
   contrast levels (e.g., resting or naturalistic conditions) or with
   modern, high-resolution MR acquisitions.},

Title = {Correcting for Superficial Bias in 7T Gradient Echo fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {The arrival of submillimeter ultra high-field fMRI makes it possible to
   compare activation profiles across cortical layers. However, the blood
   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measured by gradient echo (GE)
   fMRI is biased toward superficial layers of the cortex, which is a
   serious confound for laminar analysis. Several univariate and
   multivariate analysis methods have been proposed to correct this bias.
   We compare these methods using computational simulations of 7T fMRI data
   from regions of interest (ROI) during a visual attention paradigm. We
   also tested the methods on a pilot dataset of human 7T fMRI data. The
   simulations show that two methods-the ratio of ROI means across
   conditions and a novel application of Deming regression-offer the most
   robust correction for superficial bias. Deming regression has the
   additional advantage that it does not require that the conditions differ
   in their mean activation over voxels within an ROI. When applied to the
   pilot dataset, we observed strikingly different layer profiles when
   different attention metrics were used, but were unable to discern any
   differences in laminar attention across layers when Deming regression or
   ROI ratio was applied. Our simulations demonstrates that accurate
   correction of superficial bias is crucial to avoid drawing erroneous
   conclusions from laminar analyses of GE fMRI data, and this is affirmed
   by the results from our pilot 7T fMRI data.},

Abstract = {fMRI with high spatial resolution is beneficial for studies in
   psychology and neuroscience, but is limited by various factors such as
   prolonged imaging time, low signal to noise ratio and scarcity of
   advanced facilities. Compressed Sensing (CS) based methods for
   accelerating fMRI data acquisition are promising. Other advanced
   algorithms like k-t FOCUSS or PICCS have been developed to improve
   performance. This study aims to investigate a new method, Dual-TRACER,
   based on Temporal Resolution Acceleration with Constrained Evolution
   Reconstruction (TRACER), for accelerating fMRI acquisitions using golden
   angle variable density spiral. Both numerical simulations and in vivo
   experiments at 3T were conducted to evaluate and characterize this
   method. Results show that Dual-TRACER can provide functional images with
   a high spatial resolution (1x1 mm(2)) under an acceleration factor of 20
   while maintaining hemodynamic signals well. Compared with other
   investigated methods, dual-TRACER provides a better signal recovery,
   higher fMRI sensitivity and more reliable activation detection.},

Abstract = {Background: Neurofibrillary tangle pathology detected with tau-PET
   correlates closely with neuronal injury and cognitive symptoms in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). Complexity of rs-fMRI has been demonstrated to
   decrease with cognitive decline in AD.
   Objective: We hypothesize that the rs-fMRI complexity provides an index
   for tau-related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD process.
   Methods: Data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI3) and the Estudio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer en
   Jalisciences (EEAJ) study. Associations between tau-PET and rs-fMRI
   complexity were calculated. Potential pathways relating complexity to
   cognitive function mediated through tau-PET were assessed by path
   analysis.
   Results: We found significant negative correlations between rs-fMRI
   complexity and tau-PET in medial temporal lobe of both cohorts, and
   associations of rs-fMRI complexity with cognitive scores were mediated
   through tau-PET.
   Conclusion: The association of rs-fMRI complexity with tau-PET and
   cognition, suggests that a reduction in complexity is indicative of
   tau-related neuropathology and cognitive decline in AD processes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to introduce resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rest-fMRI) capability for brain tumor surgical
   planning. rest-fMRI is an emerging functional neuroimaging technique
   potentially able to provide new insights into brain physiology and to
   provide useful information regarding brain tumors in preoperative and
   postoperative settings. rest-fMRI evaluates low-frequency fluctuations
   in the blood oxygen level- dependent signal while the subject is at rest
   during magnetic resonance imaging examination. Multiple resting-state
   networks have been identified, including the somatosensory, language,
   and visual networks, which are of primary importance for surgical
   planning. We discuss the feasibility of rest-fMRI examination before and
   after surgical resection of brain tumors in routine clinical practice
   and the usefulness of the information obtained for surgical planning in
   brain tumor resection. rest-fMRI is particularly useful for patients who
   are unable to cooperate with the task-based paradigm, such as children
   or patients who are sedated, paretic, or aphasic. Although
   standardization and validation of rest-fMRI are still ongoing, this
   technique is feasible and valuable and can be implemented for routine
   clinical surgical planning.},

Abstract = {As a non-radiative, non-invasive imaging technique, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) has excellent effects on studying the
   activation of blood oxygen levels and functional connectivity of the

   combined with stimulation could be used to assess the activation of
   specific brain regions and the connectivity of specific pathways and
   achieve better signal capture with a clear purpose and more significant
   results. Various fMRI methods and specific stimulation paradigms have
   been proposed to investigate brain activation in a specific state, such
   as electrical, mechanical, visual, olfactory, and direct brain
   stimulation. In this review, the studies on animal brain activation
   using fMRI combined with different stimulation methods were retrieved.
   The instruments, experimental parameters, anesthesia, and animal models
   in different stimulation conditions were summarized. The findings would
   provide a reference for studies on estimating specific brain activation
   using fMRI combined with stimulation.},

   Previous Studies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},

Abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising treatment
   modality for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Repetitive TMS
   (rTMS) is widely used for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological
   diseases, such as depression, motor stroke, and neuropathic pain.
   However, the underlying mechanisms of rTMS-mediated neuronal modulation
   are not fully understood. In this respect, concurrent or simultaneous
   TMS-fMRI, in which TMS is applied during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), is a viable tool to gain insights, as it enables an
   investigation of the immediate effects of TMS. Concurrent application of
   TMS during neuroimaging usually causes severe artifacts due to magnetic
   field inhomogeneities induced by TMS. However, by carefully interleaving
   the TMS pulses with MR signal acquisition in the way that these are far
   enough apart, we can avoid any image distortions. While the very first
   feasibility studies date back to the 1990s, recent developments in coil
   hardware and acquisition techniques have boosted the number of TMS-fMRI
   applications. As such, a concurrent application requires expertise in
   both TMS and MRI mechanisms and sequencing, and the hurdle of initial
   technical set up and maintenance remains high. This review gives a
   comprehensive overview of concurrent TMS-fMRI techniques by collecting
   (1) basic information, (2) technical challenges and developments, (3) an
   overview of findings reported so far using concurrent TMS-fMRI, and (4)
   current limitations and our suggestions for improvement. By sharing this
   review, we hope to attract the interest of researchers from various
   backgrounds and create an educational knowledge base.},

Title = {Identity-mapping cascaded network for fMRI registration},
Journal = {PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Neuroscience researches based on functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) rely on accurate inter-subject image registration of functional
   regions. The intersubject alignment of fMRI can improve the statistical
   power of group analyses. Recent studies have shown the deep
   learning-based registration methods can be used for registration. In our
   work, we proposed a 30-Identity-Mapping Cascaded network (30-IMCNet) for
   rs-fMRI registration. It is a cascaded network that can warp the moving
   image progressively and finally align to the fixed image. A Combination
   unit with an identity-mapping path is added to the inputs of each IMCNet
   to guide the network training. We implemented 30-IMCNet on an rs-fMRI
   dataset (1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset) and a task-related
   fMRI dataset (Eyes Open Eyes Closed fMRI dataset). To evaluate our
   method, a group-level analysis was implemented in the testing dataset.
   For rs-fMRI, the criterions such as peak t-value of group-level t-maps,
   cluster-level evaluation, and intersubject functional network
   correlation were used to evaluate the quality of the registrations. For
   task-related fMRI, peak t-value in ALFF paired-t map and peak t-value in
   ReHo paired-t maps were used. Compared with traditional algorithm FSL,
   SPM, and deep learning algorithm Kim et al, Zhao et al our method has
   improvements of 48.90\%, 30.73\%, 36.38\%, and 16.73\% in the peak t
   value of t-maps. Our proposed method can achieve superior functional
   registration performance and thus gain a significant improvement in
   functional consistency.},

Title = {The impact of mapping interictal discharges using EEG-fMRI on the
   epilepsy presurgical clinical decision making process: A prospective
   study},

Abstract = {Purpose: We set out to establish the clinical utility of EEG-correlated
   fMRI as part of the presurgical evaluation, by measuring prospectively
   its effects on the clinical decision.
   Methods: Patients with refractory extra-temporal focal epilepsy,
   referred for presurgical evaluation were recruited in a period of 18
   months. The EEG-fMRI based localization was presented during a
   multi-disciplinary meeting after the team had defined the presumed
   Results: Sixteen patients (six women), with a median age of 28 years,
   were recruited. Interpretable EEG-fMRI results were available in 13:
   interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were recorded in eleven patients
   and seizures were recorded in two patients. In three patients, no
   epileptic activity was captured during EEG-fMRI acquisition and in two
   of those an IED topographic map correlation was performed (between EEG
   recorded inside the scanner and long-term video EEG monitoring).
   EEG-fMRI results presentation had no impact on the initial clinical
   decision in three patients (23\%) of the thirteen and resulted in a
   modification of the initial surgical plan in ten patients (77\%) of the
   thirteen finally presented in MDT; in eight patients the impact was on
   the planned placement of invasive electrodes and in two patients the
   EEG-fMRI led to additional non-invasive tests before proceeding further
   with surgery.
   Conclusion: The study is a prospective observational cohort study
   specifically designed to assess the impact of EEG-fMRI on the clinical
   decision making process, suggesting a significant influence of EEG-fMRI
   on epilepsy surgery planning.},

Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Machine learning methods have been successfully applied to neuroimaging
   signals, one of which is to decode specific task states from functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In this paper, we propose a
   model that simultaneously utilizes characteristics of both spatial and
   temporal sequential information of fMRI data with deep neural networks
   to classify the fMRI task states. We designed a convolution network
   module and a recurrent network module to extract the spatial and
   temporal features of fMRI data, respectively. In particular, we also add
   the attention mechanism to the recurrent network module, which more
   effectively highlights the brain activation state at the moment of
   reaction. We evaluated the model using task-evoked fMRI data from the
   Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, the classification accuracy got
   94.31\%, and the experimental results have shown that the model can
   effectively distinguish the brain states under different task stimuli.},

Journal = {BRAIN RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The highly convoluted cerebral cortex is characterized by two different
   topographic structures: convex gyri and concave sulci. Increasing
   studies have demonstrated that cortical gyri and sulci exhibit different
   structural connectivity. patterns. Inspired by the intrinsic structural
   differences between gyri and sulci, in this paper, we present a
   data-driven framework based on sparse representation of fMRI data for
   functional network inferences, then examine the interactions within and
   across gyral and sulcal functional networks and finally elucidate
   possible functional differences using graph theory based properties. We
   apply the proposed framework to the high-resolution Human Connectome
   Project (HCP) grayordinate fMRI data. Extensive experimental results on
   both resting state fMRI data and task-based fMRI data consistently
   suggested that gyri are more functionally integrated, while sulci are
   more functionally segregated in the organizational architecture of
   cerebral cortex, offering novel understanding of the byzantine cerebral
   cortex. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understanding brain response to audiovisual stimuli is a key challenge
   in understanding neuronal processes. In this paper, we describe our
   effort aimed at reconstructing video frames from observed functional MRI
   images. We also demonstrate that our model can predict visual objects.
   Our method constructs an autoencoder model for a set of training video
   segments to code video streams into their corresponding latent
   representations. Next, we learn a mapping from the observed fMRI
   response to the corresponding latent video frame representation.
   Finally, we pass the latent vectors computed using the fMRI response
   through the decoder to reconstruct the predicted image. We show that the
   representations of video frames and those constructed from corresponding
   fMRI images are highly clustered, the latent representations can be used
   to predict objects in video frames using just the fMRI frames, and fMRI
   responses can be used to reconstruct the inputs to predict the presence
   of faces.},

Title = {Local opposite orientation preferences in V1: fMRI sensitivity to
   fine-grained pattern information},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {The orientation of a visual grating can be decoded from human primary
   visual cortex (V1) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at
   conventional resolutions (2-3 mm voxel width, 3T scanner). It is unclear
   to what extent this information originates from different spatial scales
   of neuronal selectivity, ranging from orientation columns to global
   areal maps. According to the global-areal-map account, fMRI orientation
   decoding relies exclusively on fMRI voxels in V1 exhibiting a radial or
   vertical preference. Here we show, by contrast, that 2-mm isotropic
   voxels in a small patch of V1 within a quarterfield representation
   exhibit reliable opposite selectivities. Sets of voxels with opposite
   selectivities are locally intermingled and each set can support
   orientation decoding. This indicates that global areal maps cannot fully
   account for orientation information in fMRI and demonstrates that fMRI
   also reflects fine-grained patterns of neuronal selectivity.},

Title = {Combined resting state-fMRI and calcium recordings show stable brain
   states for task-induced fMRI in mice under combined ISO/MED anesthesia},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {245},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {For fMRI in animal models, the combination of low-dose anesthetic,
   isoflurane (ISO), and the sedative medetomidine (MED) has recently
   become an advocated regimen to achieve stable neuronal states and brain
   networks in rats that are required for reliable task-induced BOLD fMRI.
   However, in mice the temporal stability of neuronal states and networks
   in resting-state (rs)-fMRI experiments during the combined ISO/MED
   regimen has not been systematically investigated. Using a multimodal
   approach with optical calcium (Ca2+) recordings and rs-fMRI, we
   investigated cortical neuronal/astrocytic Ca2+ activity states and brain
   networks at multiple time points while switching from anesthesia with
   1\% ISO to a combined ISO/MED regimen. We found that cortical activity
   states reached a steady-state 45 min following start of MED infusion as
   indicated by stable Ca2+ transients. Similarly, rs-networks were not
   statistically different between anesthesia with ISO and the combined
   ISO/MED regimen 45 and 100 min after start of MED. Importantly, during
   the transition time we identified changed rs-network signatures that
   likely reflect the different mode of action of the respective
   anesthetic; these included a dose-dependent increase in cortico-cortical
   functional connectivity (FC) presumably caused by reduction of ISO
   concentration and decreased FC in subcortical arousal nuclei due to MED
   infusion. Furthermore, we report detection of visual stimulation-induced
   BOLD fMRI during the stable ISO/MED neuronal state 45 min after
   induction. Based on our findings, we recommend a 45-minute waiting
   period after switching from ISO anesthesia to the combined ISO/MED
   regimen before performing rs- or task-induced fMRI experiments.},

Abstract = {To further advance functional MRI (fMRI)-based brain science, it is
   critical to dissect fMRI activity at the circuit level. To achieve this
   goal, we combined brain-wide fMRI with neuronal silencing in
   well-defined regions. Since focal inactivation suppresses excitatory
   output to downstream pathways, intact input and suppressed out-put
   circuits can be separated. Highly specific cerebral blood
   volume-weighted fMRI was performed with optogenetic stimula-tion of
   local GABAergic neurons in mouse somatosensory regions. Brain-wide
   spontaneous somatosensory networks were found mostly in ipsilateral
   cortical and subcortical areas, which differed from the bilateral
   homotopic connections commonly observed in resting-state fMRI data. The
   evoked fMRI responses to somatosen-sory stimulation in regions of the
   somatosensory network were successfully dissected, allowing the relative
   contributions of spino-thalamic (ST), thalamocortical (TC),
   corticothalamic (CT), cortico-cortical (CC) inputs, and local
   intracortical circuits to be determined. The ventral posterior thalamic
   nucleus receives ST inputs, while the posterior medial thalamic nucleus
   receives CT inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with TC
   inputs. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) receives mostly direct
   CC inputs from S1 and a few TC inputs from the ventral posterolateral
   nucleus. The TC and CC input layers in cortical regions were identi-fied
   by laminar-specific fMRI responses with a full width at half maximum of
   <150 mu m. Long-range synaptic inputs in cortical areas were amplified
   approximately twofold by local intracortical cir-cuits, which is
   consistent with electrophysiological recordings. Overall, whole-brain
   fMRI with optogenetic inactivation revealed brain-wide,
   population-based, long-range circuits, which could complement data
   typically collected in conventional microscopic functional circuit
   studies.},

Abstract = {Dimension reduction is essential in fMRI decoding, but the complex
   relationship between fMRI data and class labels is often unknown or not
   well modeled so that the most effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.)
   directions can hardly be identified. In the present study, we introduce
   a novel fMRI decoding approach based on an effective and general
   dimension reduction method, namely sliced inverse regression (SIR),
   which can exploit class information for estimating e.d.r. directions
   even when the relationship between fMRI data and class labels is not
   explicitly known. We incorporate singular value decomposition (SVD) into
   SIR to overcome SIR's limitation in dealing with ultra-high-dimensional
   data, and integrate SVD-SIR into a pattern classifier to enable
   quantification of the contributions of fMRI voxels to class labels. The
   resultant new SIR decoding analysis (SIR-DA) approach is capable of
   decoding behavioral responses and identifying predictive fMRI patterns.
   Simulation results showed that SIR-DA can more accurately detect e.d.r.
   directions and achieve higher classification accuracy than decoding
   approaches based on conventional dimension reduction methods. Further,
   we applied SIR-DA on real-world pain-evoked fMRI data to decode the
   level of pain perception and showed that SIR-DA can achieve higher
   accuracy in pain prediction than conventional methods. These results
   suggest that SIR-DA is an effective data-driven technique to decode
   behavioral or cognitive states from fMRI data and to uncover unknown
   brain patterns associated with behavior or cognitive responses. (C) 2017

   form area},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Lexical embedding is common in all languages and elicits mutual
   orthographic interference between an embedded word and its carrier. The
   neural basis of such interference remains unknown. We employed a novel
   fMRI prime-target embedded word paradigm to test for involvement of a
   visual word form area (VWFA) in left ventral occipitotemporal cortex in
   co-activation of embedded words and their carriers. Based on the results
   of related fMRI studies we predicted either enhancement or suppression
   of fMRI responses to embedded words initially viewed as primes, and
   repeated in the context of target carrier words. Our results clearly
   showed enhancement of fMRI responses in the VWFA to embedded-carrier
   word pairs as compared to unrelated prime-target pairs. In contrast to
   non-visual language-related areas (e.g., left inferior frontal gyrus),
   enhanced fMRI responses did not occur in the VWFA when embedded-carrier
   word pairs were restricted to the left visual hemifield. Our finding of
   fMRI enhancement in the VWFA is novel evidence of its involvement in
   representational rivalry between orthographically similar words, and the
   co-activation of embedded words and their carriers.},

Title = {Adaptive independent vector analysis for multi-subject complex-valued
   fMRI data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {281},
Pages = {49-63},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Background: Complex-valued fMRI data can provide additional insights
   beyond magnitude-only data. However, independent vector analysis (IVA),
   which has exhibited great potential for group analysis of magnitude-only
   fMRI data, has rarely been applied to complex-valued fMRI data. The main
   challenges in this application include the extremely noisy nature and
   large variability of the source component vector (SCV) distribution.
   New method: To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive
   fixed-point IVA algorithm for analyzing multiple-subject complex-valued
   fMRI data. We exploited a multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution
   (MGGD)-based nonlinear function to match varying SCV distributions in
   which the MGGD shape parameter was estimated using maximum likelihood
   estimation. To achieve our de-noising goal, we updated the MGGD-based
   nonlinearity in the dominant SCV subspace, and employed a post-IVA
   de-noising strategy based on phase information in the IVA estimates. We
   also incorporated the pseudo covariance matrix of fMRI data into the
   algorithm to emphasize the noncircularity of complex-valued fMRI
   sources.
   Results: Results from simulated and experimental fMRI data demonstrated
   the efficacy of our method. Comparison with existing method(s): Our
   approach exhibited significant improvements over typical complex-valued
   IVA algorithms, especially during higher noise levels and larger spatial
   and temporal changes. As expected, the proposed complex-valued IVA
   algorithm detected more contiguous and reasonable activations than the
   magnitude-only method for task-related (393\%) and default mode (301\%)
   spatial maps.
   Conclusions: The proposed approach is suitable for decomposing
   multi-subject complex-valued fMRI data, and has great potential for
   capturing additional subject variability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {fMRI study of olfactory processing in mice under three anesthesia
   protocols: Insight into the effect of ketamine on olfactory processing},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {213},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable tool for
   studying neural activations in the central nervous system of animals due
   to its wide spatial coverage and non-invasive nature. However, the
   advantages of fMRI have not been fully realized in functional studies in
   mice, especially in the olfactory system, possibly due to the lack of
   suitable anesthesia protocols with spontaneous breathing. Since mice are
   widely used in biomedical research, it is desirable to evaluate
   different anesthesia protocols for olfactory fMRI studies in mice.
   Dexmedetomidine (DEX) as a sedative/anesthetic has been introduced to
   fMRI studies in mice, but it has a limited anesthesia duration. To
   extend the anesthesia duration, DEX has been combined with a low dose of
   isoflurane (ISO) or ketamine (KET) in previous functional studies in
   mice. In this report, olfactory fMRI studies were performed under three
   anesthesia protocols (DEX alone, DEX/ISO, and DEX/KET) in three
   different groups of mice. Isoamyl-acetate was used as an odorant, and
   the odorant-induced neural activations were measured by blood
   oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. BOLD fMRI responses were
   observed in the olfactory bulb (OB), anterior olfactory nuclei (AON),
   and piriform cortex (Pir). Interestingly, BOLD fMRI activations were
   also observed in the prefrontal cortical region (PFC), which are most
   likely caused by the draining vein effect. The response in the OB showed
   no adaptation to either repeated odor stimulations or continuous odor
   exposure, but the response in the Pir showed adaptation during the
   continuous odor exposure. The data also shows that ISO suppresses the
   olfactory response in the OB and AON, while KET enhances the olfactory
   response in the Pir. Thus, DEX/KET should be an attractive anesthesia
   for olfactory fMRI in mice.},

Title = {Neuropsychological Evaluation and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   Tasks in the Preoperative Assessment of Patients with Brain Tumors: A
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Current surgical treatment of gliomas relies on a
   function-preserving, maximally safe resection approach. Functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a widely employed technology for
   this purpose. A preoperative neuropsychological evaluation should
   accompany this exam. However, only a few studies have reported both
   neuropsychological tests and fMRI tasks for preoperative planning-the
   current study aimed to systematically review the scientific literature
   on the topic. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We included
   studies that reported both neuropsychological tests and fMRI. Exclusion
   criteria were: no brain tumors, underage patients, no preoperative
   assessment, resting-state fMRI only, or healthy sample
   population/preclinical studies. Results: We identified 123 papers, but
   only 15 articles were included. Eight articles focused on language;
   three evaluated cognitive performance; single papers studied
   sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal functions, insular cortex, and
   cerebellar activation. Two qualitative studies focused on visuomotor
   function and language. According to some authors, there was a strong
   correlation between performance in presurgical neuropsychological tests
   and fMRI. Several papers suggested that selecting well-adjusted and
   individualized neuropsychological tasks may enable the development of
   personalized and more efficient protocols. The fMRI findings may also
   help identify plasticity phenomena to avoid unintentional damage during
   neurosurgery. Conclusions: Most studies have focused on language, the
   most commonly evaluated cognitive function. The correlation between
   neuropsychological and fMRI results suggests that altered functions
   during the neuropsychological assessment may help identify patients who
   could benefit from an fMRI and, possibly, functions that should be
   tested. Neuropsychological evaluation and fMRI have complementary roles
   in the preoperative assessment.},

Title = {MACS - a new SPM toolbox for model assessment, comparison and selection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {306},
Pages = {19-31},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background: In cognitive neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data are widely analyzed using general linear models
   (GLMs). However, model quality of GLMs for fMRI is rarely assessed, in
   part due to the lack of formal measures for statistical model inference.
   New method: We introduce a new SPM toolbox for model assessment,
   comparison and selection (MACS) of GLMs applied to fMRI data. MACS
   includes classical, information-theoretic and Bayesian methods of model
   assessment previously applied to GLMs for fMRI as well as recent
   methodological developments of model selection and model averaging in
   fMRI data analysis.
   Results: The toolbox which is freely available from GitHub directly
   builds on the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package and
   is easy-to-use, general-purpose, modular, readable and extendable. We
   validate the toolbox by reproducing model selection and model averaging
   results from earlier publications.
   Comparison with existing methods: A previous toolbox for model diagnosis
   in fMRI has been discontinued and other approaches to model comparison
   between GLMs have not been translated into reusable computational
   resources in the past.
   Conclusions: Increased attention on model quality will lead to lower
   false-positive rates in cognitive neuroscience and increased application
   of the MACS toolbox will increase the reproducibility of GLM analyses
   and is likely to increase the replicability of fMRI studies.},

Title = {Mixed-dictionary models and variational inference in task fMRI for
   shorter scans and better image quality},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The propensity of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (T-fMRI) to large physiological fluctuations, measurement noise, and
   imaging artifacts entail longer scans and higher temporal resolution
   (trading off spatial resolution) to alleviate the effects of
   degradation. This paper focuses on methods towards reducing scan times
   and enabling higher spatial resolution in T-fMRI. We propose a novel
   mixed dictionary model combining (i) the task-based design matrix, (ii)
   a learned dictionary from resting-state fMRI, and (iii) an
   analytically-defined wavelet frame. For model fitting, we propose a
   novel adaptation of the inference framework relying on variational
   Bayesian expectation maximization with nested minorization. We leverage
   the mixed-dictionary model coupled with variational inference to enable
   2 x shorter scan times in T-fMRI, improving activation-map estimates
   towards the same quality as those resulting from longer scans. We also
   propose a scheme with potential to increase spatial resolution through
   temporally undersampled acquisition. Results on motor-task fMRI and
   gambling-task fMRI show that our framework leads to improved
   activation-map estimates over the state of the art.(c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mice is
   increasingly prevalent, providing a means to non-invasively characterise
   functional abnormalities associated with genetic models of human
   diseases. The predominant stimulus used in task-based fMRI in the mouse
   is electrical stimulation of the paw. Task-based fMRI in mice using
   visual stimuli remains underexplored, despite visual stimuli being
   common in human fMRI studies. In this study, we map the mouse brain
   visual system with BOLD measurements at 9.4 T using flashing light
   stimuli with medetomidine anaesthesia. BOLD responses were observed in
   the lateral geniculate nucleus, the superior colliculus and the primary
   visual area of the cortex, and were modulated by the flashing frequency,
   diffuse vs focussed light and stimulus context. Negative BOLD responses
   were measured in the visual cortex at 10 Hz flashing frequency; but
   turned positive below 5 Hz. In addition, the use of interleaved snapshot
   GE-EPI improved fMRI image quality without diminishing the temporal
   contrast-noise-ratio. Taken together, this work demonstrates a novel
   methodological protocol in which the mouse brain visual system can be
   non-invasively investigated using BOLD fMRI. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {There are considerable gaps in our understanding of the relationship
   between human brain activity measured at different temporal and spatial
   scales. Here, electrocorticography (ECoG) measures were used to predict
   functional MRI changes in the sensorimotor cortex in two brain states:
   at rest and during motor performance. The specificity of this
   relationship to spatial co-localisation of the two signals was also
   investigated. We acquired simultaneous ECoG-fMRI in the sensorimotor
   cortex of three patients with epilepsy. During motor activity, high
   gamma power was the only frequency band where the electrophysiological
   response was co-localised with fMRI measures across all subjects. The
   best model of fMRI changes across states was its principal components, a
   parsimonious description of the entire ECoG spectrogram. This model
   performed much better than any others that were based either on the
   classical frequency bands or on summary measures of cross-spectral
   changes. The region-specific fMRI signal is reflected in spatially and
   spectrally distributed EEG activity.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Optical fiber-mediated optogenetic activation and neuronal Ca2+
   recording in combination with fMRI provide a multi-modal fMRI platform.
   Here, we developed an MRI-guided robotic arm (MgRA) as a flexible
   positioning system with high precision to real-time assist optical fiber
   brain intervention for multi-modal animal fMRI. Besides the ex vivo
   precision evaluation, we present the highly reliable brain activity
   patterns in the projected basal forebrain regions upon MgRA-driven
   optogenetic stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus. Also, we show the
   step-wise optical fiber targeting thalamic nuclei and map the
   region-specific functional connectivity with whole-brain fMRI
   accompanied by simultaneous calcium recordings to specify its
   circuit-specificity. The MgRA also guides the real-time microinjection
   to specific deep brain nuclei, which is demonstrated by an Mn-enhanced
   MRI method. The MgRA represents a clear advantage over the standard
   stereotaxic-based fiber implantation and opens a broad avenue to
   investigate the circuit-specific functional brain mapping with the
   multi-modal fMRI platform.},

Title = {Validating layer-specific VASO across species},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Cerebral blood volume (CBV) has been shown to be a robust and important
   physiological parameter for quantitative interpretation of functional
   (f)MRI, capable of delivering highly localized mapping of neural
   activity. Indeed, with recent advances in ultra-high-field ( >= 7T) MRI
   hardware and associated sequence libraries, it has become possible to
   capture non-invasive CBV weighted fMRI signals across cortical layers.
   One of the most widely used approaches to achieve this (in humans) is
   through vascular-space-occupancy (VASO) fMRI. Unfortunately, the exact
   contrast mechanisms of layer-dependent VASO fMRI have not been validated
   for human fMRI and thus interpretation of such data is confounded. Here
   we validate the signal source of layer-dependent SS-SI VASO fMRI using
   multi-modal imaging in a rat model in response to neuronal activation
   (somatosensory cortex) and respiratory challenge (hypercapnia). In
   particular VASO derived CBV measures are directly compared to concurrent
   measures of total haemoglobin changes from high resolution intrinsic
   optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS). Quantified cortical layer profiling
   is demonstrated to be in agreement between VASO and contrast enhanced
   fMRI (using monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles, MION). Responses
   show high spatial localisation to layers of cortical processing
   independent of confounding large draining veins which can hamper BOLD
   fMRI studies, (depending on slice positioning). Thus, a cross species
   comparison is enabled using VASO as a common measure. We find increased
   VASO based CBV reactivity (3.1 +/- 1.2 fold increase) in humans compared
   to rats. Together, our findings confirm that the VASO contrast is indeed
   a reliable estimate of layer-specific CBV changes. This validation study
   increases the neuronal interpretability of human layer-dependent VASO
   fMRI as an appropriate method in neuroscience application studies, in
   which the presence of large draining intracortical and pial veins limits
   neuroscientific inference with BOLD fMRI.},

Title = {Statistical analysis of fMRI using wavelets: Big Data, denoising,

Abstract = {Over the past decade functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has
   been intensively used to study the complex functional network
   organization of the human brain and how it changes in time. An fMRI
   machine produces 3D time-course cerebral images that contain hundreds of
   thousands of voxels and each voxel is scanned for hundreds of times.
   This potentially allows the researchers to explore functional
   connectivity on a voxel-to-voxel level, and also yields a number of
   serious statistical complications. First of all, the high-dimension
   property of fMRI data turns it into Big Data. Furthermore, the study of
   functional brain network for so many voxels involves the problem of
   estimation of and simultaneous inference for large-p-small-n
   cross-covariance matrices. Furthermore, all problems should be solved in
   the presence of notoriously large fMRI noise which often forces
   statisticians to average signals over large areas instead of considering
   a network between individual voxels. An attractive alternative to the
   averaging, discussed in the paper, is a multiresolution wavelet analysis
   complemented by special procedures of estimating noise and estimation
   and simultaneous inference for cross-covariance and cross-correlation
   matrices for hundreds of thousands pairs of voxels, and it is fair to
   say that if wavelets have not been already known, fMRI applications
   would necessitates their creation. Both task and resting-state fMRI are
   considered, and lessons from the wavelet analysis of ultra-fast and
   conventional neuroplasticity fMRI experiments are presented. The article
   is self-contained and does not require familiarity with wavelets or
   fMRI. This article is categorized under: Algorithms and Computational
   Methods > Numerical Methods Applications of Computational Statistics >
   Signal and Image Processing and Coding},

Title = {Mouse BOLD fMRI at ultrahigh field detects somatosensory networks
   including thalamic nuclei},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {203-214},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Forepaw somatosensory stimulation induces neural activities in relay
   thalamic nuclei, the primary somatosensory cortex of forelimb (S1FL),
   and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). However, rodent fMRI
   studies of somatosensory stimulation have commonly reported BOLD changes
   only in S1FL, which may be due to side effects of anesthetics and/or the
   low sensitivity in the thalamus. Thus, we have obtained mouse BOLD fMRI
   under newly-adopted ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. High-resolution BOLD
   fMRI obtained with same imaging parameters at 9.4T versus 15.2T shows
   the improvement of functional detectability by >= 2 times at 15.2T due
   to higher signal intensity and larger BOLD response. The fMRI responses
   at 15.2T were robustly observed at well-known somatosensory networks
   including thalamus. Second, echo-time-dependent BOLD signals are
   dominant based on multi-echo fMRI data. A ratio of BOLD responses in
   S1FL to thalamus is similar to 2, which is not related to different
   baseline T-2({*}) or different cerebral blood volume. Third,
   group-averaged 15.2T BOLD maps show activities in S1FL, S2, motor
   cortices, and thalamic nuclei, which agree well with neural tracing
   network data from the Allen Institute, demonstrating that fMRI detects
   entire somatosensory networks. Our data suggest that ultrahigh field
   fMRI provides a unique window into understanding functional networks in
   normal and transgenic mouse models noninvasively.},

   algorithms for fMRI data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-175},
Abstract = {Independent component analysis, a data-driven analysis method, has found
   significant applications in task-based as well as resting state fMRI
   studies. There are numbers of independent component analysis algorithms
   available, but only a few of them have been used frequently so far for
   fMRI images. With a view that algorithms that are overlooked may
   outperform the most opted, a comparative study is taken up in this paper
   to analyze their abilities for the purpose of synthesis of fMRI images.
   In this paper, ten independent component algorithms: Fast ICA, INFOMAX,
   SIMBEC, JADE, ERICA, EVD, RADICAL, ICA-EBM, ERBM, and COMBI are
   compared. Their separation abilities are adjudged on both, synthetic and
   real fMRI images. Performance to decompose synthetic fMRI images is
   being monitored on the basis of spatial correlation coefficients, time
   elapsed to extract independent components and the visual appearance of
   independent components. Ranking of their performances on task-based real
   fMRI images are based on the closeness of time courses of identified
   independent components with model time course and the closeness of
   spatial maps of components with spatial templates while their
   competencies for resting state fMRI data are analyzed by examining how
   distinctly they decompose the data into the most consistent resting
   state networks. Sum of mutual information between all the permutations
   of decomposed components of resting state fMRI data are also calculated.},

Title = {Transfer Learning from Healthy to Unhealthy Patients for the Automated

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an essential tool for
   the pre-surgical planning of brain tumor removal, which allows the
   identification of functional brain networks to preserve the patient's
   neurological functions. One fMRI technique used to identify the
   functional brain network is the resting-state-fMRI (rs-fMRI). This
   technique is not routinely available because of the necessity to have an
   expert reviewer who can manually identify each functional network. The
   lack of sufficient unhealthy data has so far hindered a data-driven
   approach based on machine learning tools for full automation of this
   clinical task. In this article, we investigate the possibility of such
   an approach via the transfer learning method from healthy control data
   to unhealthy patient data to boost the detection of functional brain
   networks in rs-fMRI data. The end-to-end deep learning model implemented
   in this article distinguishes seven principal functional brain networks
   using fMRI images. The best performance of a 75\% correct recognition
   rate is obtained from the proposed deep learning architecture, which
   shows its superiority over other machine learning algorithms that were
   equally tested for this classification task. Based on this best
   reference model, we demonstrate the possibility of boosting the results
   of our algorithm with transfer learning from healthy patients to
   unhealthy patients. This application of the transfer learning technique
   opens interesting possibilities because healthy control subjects can be
   easily enrolled for fMRI data acquisition since it is noninvasive.
   Consequently, this process helps to compensate for the usual small
   cohort of unhealthy patient data. This transfer learning approach could
   be extended to other medical imaging modalities and pathology.},

Title = {Activation volume vs BOLD signal change as measures of fMRI activation -
   Its impact on GABA - fMRI activation correlation},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Purpose: To explore the relative robustness of functional MRI (fMRI)
   activation volume and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal change
   as fMRI metric, and to study the effect of relative robustness on the
   correlation between fMRI activation and cortical gamma amino butyric
   acid (GABA) in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis
   (MS).
   Methods: fMRI data were acquired from healthy controls and patients with
   MS, with the subjects peforming self paced bilateral finger tapping in
   block design. GABA spectroscopy was performed with voxel placed on the
   area of maximum activation during fMRI. Activation volume and BOLD
   signal changes at primary motor cortex (M1), as well as GABA
   concentration were calculated for each patient.
   Results: Activation volume correlated with BOLD signal change in healthy
   controls, but no such correlation was observed in patients with MS. This
   difference was likely the result of higher intersubject noise variance
   in the patient population. GABA concentration correlated with M1
   activation volume in patients but not in controls, and did not correlate
   with any fMRI metric in patients or controls.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that activation volume is a more robust
   measure than BOLD signal change in a group with high intersubject noise
   variance as in patients with MS. Additionally, this study demonstrated
   difference in correlation behavior between GABA concentration and the 2
   fMRI metrics in patients with MS, suggesting that GABA - activation
   volume correlation is more appropriate measure in the patient group. (C)

Abstract = {Topics: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) evaluation of
   HyberBaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) effects on chronic cerebral stroke
   Patients (Pts). Introduction: Our aim was to evaluate with fMRI, in a 3
   Tesla system, the functional effects of HBOT on the Central Nervous
   System (CNS) in four Pts with established ischaemic and haemorrhagic
   cerebral strokes (2 Pts each). To our knowledge, no author used fMRI
   technique for this purpose, till now. Methods: All four Pts underwent a
   fMRI study before and after 40 HBOT sessions, with a time window of a
   few days. They carried out two language (text listening, silent
   word-verb generation) and two motor (hand and foot movements) tasks (30
   s On-Off block paradigms). Results: After HBOT, all Pts reported a
   clinical improvement, mostly concerning language fluency and motor
   paresis. fMRI analysis demonstrated an increase in both the extent and
   the statistical significance of most of the examined eloquent areas.
   Conclusions: These changes were consistent with the clinical improvement
   in all Pts, suggesting a possible role of fMRI in revealing neuronal
   functional correlates of neuronal plasticity and HBOT-related
   neoangiogenesis. Although only four Pts were examined, fMRI proved to be
   a sensitive, non-invasive and reliable modality for monitoring neuronal
   functional changes before and after HBOT.},

Abstract = {Extensive research is going on in the field of analyzing the
   applications involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   with the help of machine learning classifiers. Studies have proven that
   inspiring new information can be obtained through neuroimaging data
   using machine learning classifiers. Feature selection has been an active
   research area and its key idea is to select a subset of input variables
   by removing features with little or no predictive data. Feature
   selection enhanced the clarity of the resulting classifier models and
   often dimensions a model that generalizes better to unseen points. In
   this work, fMRI classification technique is proposed using Multiple
   Parallel Feature Selection Algorithm. In case of parallel feature
   selection, the proposed algorithm's computation is fully improved and
   parallelized based on data partitioning. Inputs for classifiers are used
   extensively through voxel-based features. The fMRI images are classified
   as normal or abnormal. From healthy persons normal fMRI images were
   obtained and from subjects with schizophrenia abnormal fMRI were
   obtained and a total of 140 normal fMRI and 67 abnormal fMRI were used.
   Multiple particle swarm optimization was used after independent
   component analysis phase and techniques varying by c1 and c2 were used
   through cluster computing techniques. From the obtained cluster the
   feature subset was selected and support vector machine is made use in
   classifying.},

Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging modalities have enhanced our understanding of
   juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) underlying neural mechanisms. Due to
   its non-invasive, sensitive and analytical nature, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) provides valuable insights into relevant
   functional brain networks and their segregation and integration
   properties. We systematically reviewed the contribution of resting-state
   and task-based fMRI to the current understanding of the pathophysiology
   and the patterns of seizure propagation in JME Altogether, despite some
   discrepancies, functional findings suggest that
   corticothalamo-striato-cerebellar network along with default-mode
   network and salience network are the most affected networks in patients
   with JME. However, further studies are required to investigate the
   association between JME's main deficiencies, e.g., motor and cognitive
   deficiencies and fMRI findings. Moreover, simultaneous
   electroencephalography-fMRI (EEG-fMRI) studies indicate that alterations
   of these networks play a role in seizure modulation but fall short of
   identifying a causal relationship between altered functional properties
   and seizure propagation. This review highlights the complex
   pathophysiology of JME, which necessitates the design of more
   personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this group.},

   Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Object: A real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   feedback during ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) under general anesthesia (or ``asleep{''} DBS) does
   not exist. We hypothesized that it was feasible to acquire a reliable
   and responsive fMRI during asleep VIM DBS surgery. Methods: We
   prospectively enrolled 10 consecutive patients who underwent asleep DBS
   for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor. Under
   general anesthesia, we acquired resting-state functional MRI immediately
   before and after the cannula insertion. Reliability was determined by a
   temporal signal-to-noise-ratio >100. Responsiveness was determined based
   on the fMRI signal change upon insertion of the cannula to the VIM.
   Results: It was feasible to acquire reliable fMRI during asleep DBS
   surgery. The fMRI signal was responsive to the brain cannula insertion,
   revealing a reduction in the tremor network's functional connectivity,
   which did not reach statistical significance in the group analysis.
   Conclusions: It is feasible to acquire a reliable and responsive fMRI
   signal during asleep DBS. The acquisition steps and the preprocessing
   pipeline developed in these experiments will be useful for future
   investigations to develop fMRI-based feedback for asleep DBS surgery.},

   Neurofeedback},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The most common feedback displays in the fMRI environment are visual,
   e.g., in which participants try to increase or decrease the level of a
   thermometer. However, haptic feedback is increasingly valued in computer
   interaction tasks, particularly for real-time fMRI feedback.
   fMRI-neurofeedback is a clinical intervention that has not yet taken
   advantage of this trend. Here we describe a low-cost, user-friendly,
   MR-compatible system that can provide graded haptic vibrotactile
   stimulation in an initial application to fMRI neurofeedback. We also
   present a feasibility demonstration showing that we could successfully
   set up the system and obtain data in the context of a neurofeedback
   paradigm. We conclude that vibrotactile stimulation using this low-cost
   system is a viable method of feedback presentation, and encourage
   neurofeedback researchers to incorporate this type of feedback into
   their studies.},

Abstract = {Research exploring the mechanism of acupuncture has been a hot topic in
   medicine. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
   research is a noninvasive and extensive method, which is aimed at the
   research of the mechanism of acupuncture. Researchers use fMRI
   technologies to inspect the acupuncture process. The authors reviewed
   the application of rs-fMRI in acupuncture research in recent 10 years
   from the aspects of studying acupoints, subjects, acupuncture methods,
   and intensities. The results found that the application of rs-fMRI in
   acupuncture research mainly includes research on the onset mechanism of
   acupuncture treatment; visual evidence of diagnosis and treatment of
   dominant diseases; efficacy assessments; physiological mechanism of
   acupoint stimulation; and specific visualization of acupoints.},

Title = {Odor-evoked layer-specific fMRI activities in the awake mouse olfactory
   bulb},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {274},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Awake rodent fMRI is increasingly common over the use of anesthesia
   since it permits behavioral paradigms and does not confound normal brain
   function or neurovascular coupling. It is well established that adequate
   acclimation to the loud fMRI environment and head fixation reduces
   stress in the rodents and allows for whole brain imaging with little
   contamination from motion. However, it is unknown whether
   high-resolution fMRI with increased susceptibility to motion and lower
   sensitivity can measure small, but spatially discrete, activations in
   awake mice. To examine this, we used contrast-enhanced cerebral blood
   volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI in the mouse olfactory bulb for its enhanced
   sensitivity and neural specificity. We determined that activation
   patterns in the glomerular layer to four different odors were spatially
   distinct and were consistent with previously estab-lished histological
   patterns. In addition, odor-evoked laminar activations were greatest in
   superficial layers that decreased with laminar depth, similar to
   previous observations. Interestingly, the fMRI response strengths in the
   granule cell layer were greater in awake mice than our previous
   anesthetized rat studies, suggesting that feedback neural activities
   were intact with wakefulness. We finally determined that fMRI signal
   changes to repeated odor exposure (i.e., olfactory adaptation)
   attenuated relatively more in the feedback granule cell layer compared
   to the input glomerular layer, which is consistent with prior
   observations. We, therefore, conclude that high-resolution CBVw fMRI can
   measure odor-specific activation patterns and distinguish changes in
   laminar activity of head and body restrained awake mice.},

Abstract = {Integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is an open problem, which has motivated many
   researches. The most important challenge in EEG-fMRI integration is the
   unknown relationship between these two modalities. In this paper, we
   extract the same features (spatial map of neural activity) from both
   modality. Therefore, the proposed integration method does not need any
   assumption about the relationship of EEG and fMRI. We present a source
   localization method from scalp EEG signal using jointly fMRI analysis
   results as prior spatial information and source separation for providing
   temporal courses of sources of interest. The performance of the proposed
   method is evaluated quantitatively along with multiple sparse priors
   method and sparse Bayesian learning with the fMRI results as prior
   information. Localization bias and source distribution index are used to
   measure the performance of different localization approaches with or
   without a variety of fMRI-EEG mismatches on simulated realistic data.
   The method is also applied to experimental data of face perception of 16
   subjects. Simulation results show that the proposed method is
   significantly stable against the noise with low localization bias.
   Although the existence of an extra region in the fMRI data enlarges
   localization bias, the proposed method outperforms the other methods.
   Conversely, a missed region in the fMRI data does not affect the
   localization bias of the common sources in the EEG-fMRI data. Results on
   experimental data are congruent with previous studies and produce
   clusters in the fusiform and occipital face areas (FFA and OFA,
   respectively). Moreover, it shows high stability in source localization
   against variations in different subjects.},

   dataset for multimodal data integration},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Combining EEG and fMRI allows for integration of fine spatial and
   accurate temporal resolution yet presents numerous challenges,
   noticeably if performed in real-time to implement a Neurofeedback (NF)
   loop. Here we describe a multimodal dataset of EEG and fMRI acquired
   simultaneously during a motor imagery NF task, supplemented with MRI
   structural data. The study involved 30 healthy volunteers undergoing
   five training sessions. We showed the potential and merit of
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI NF in previous work. Here we illustrate the type
   of information that can be extracted from this dataset and show its
   potential use. This represents one of the first simultaneous recording
   of EEG and fMRI for NF and here we present the first open access
   bi-modal NF dataset integrating EEG and fMRI. We believe that it will be
   a valuable tool to (1) advance and test methodologies for multi-modal
   data integration, (2) improve the quality of NF provided, (3) improve
   methodologies for de-noising EEG acquired under MRI and (4) investigate
   the neuromarkers of motor-imagery using multi-modal information.},

Title = {Resting State fMRI: A Valuable Tool for Studying Cognitive Dysfunction
   in PD},
Journal = {PARKINSONS DISEASE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Cognitive impairment is a common disabling symptom in PD. Unlike motor
   symptoms, the mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's
   disease (PD) remains unclear and may involve multiple pathophysiological
   processes. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
   is a fast-developing research field, and its application in cognitive
   impairments in PD is rapidly growing. In this review, we summarize
   rs-fMRI studies on cognitive function in PD and discuss the strong
   potential of rs-fMRI in this area. rs-fMRI can help reveal the
   pathophysiology of cognitive symptoms in PD, facilitate early
   identification of PD patients with cognitive impairment, distinguish PD
   dementia from dementia with Lewy bodies, and monitor and guide treatment
   for cognitive impairment in PD. In particular, ongoing and future
   longitudinal studies would enhance the ability of rs-fMRI in predicting
   PD dementia. In combination with other modalities such as positron
   emission tomography, rs-fMRI could give us more information on the
   underlying mechanism of cognitive deficits in PD.},

Title = {Removal of physiological artifacts from simultaneous EEG and fMRI
   recordings},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objective: Simultaneous recording of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows a combination of
   eletrophysiological and haemodynamic information to be used to form a
   more complete picture of cerebral dynamics. However, EEG recorded within
   the MRI scanner is contaminated by both imaging artifacts and
   physiological artifacts. The majority of the techniques used to
   pre-process such EEG focus on removal of the imaging and
   balistocardiogram artifacts, with some success, but don't remove all
   other physiological artifacts. Methods: We propose a new offline EEG
   artifact removal method based upon a combination of independent
   component analysis and fMRI-based head movement estimation to aid the
   removal of physiological artifacts from EEG recorded during EEG-fMRI
   recordings. Our method makes novel use of head movement trajectories
   estimated from the fMRI recording in order to assist with identifying
   physiological artifacts in the EEG and is designed to be used after
   removal of the fMRI imaging artifact from the EEG. Results: We evaluate
   our method on EEG recorded during a joint EEG-fMRI session from healthy
   adult participants. Our method significantly reduces the influence of
   all types of physiological artifacts on the EEG. We also compare our
   method with a state-of-the-art physiological artifact removal method and
   demonstrate superior performance removing physiological artifacts.
   Conclusions: Our proposed method is able to remove significantly more
   physiological artifact components from the EEG, recorded during a joint
   EEG-fMRI session, than other state-of-the-art methods. Significance: Our
   proposed method represents a marked improvement over current processing
   pipelines for removing physiological noise from EEG recorded during a
   joint EEG-fMRI session. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical

Title = {Systematic Review: Anaesthetic Protocols and Management as Confounders
   in Rodent Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (BOLD fMRI)-Part A: Effects of Changes in Physiological
   Parameters},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Background: To understand brain function in health and disease,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in rodent
   models. Because animals need to be immobilised for image acquisition,
   fMRI is commonly performed under anaesthesia. The choice of anaesthetic
   protocols and may affect fMRI readouts, either directly or via changing
   physiological balance, and thereby threaten the scientific validity of
   fMRI in rodents.
   Methods: The present study systematically reviewed the literature
   investigating the influence of different anaesthesia regimes and changes
   in physiological parameters as confounders of blood oxygen level
   dependent (BOLD) fMRI in rats and mice. Four databases were searched,
   studies selected according to pre-defined criteria, and risk of bias
   assessed for each study. Results are reported in two separate articles;
   this part of the review focuses on effects of changes in physiological
   parameters.
   Results: A total of 121 publications was included, of which 49 addressed
   effects of changes in physiological parameters. Risk of bias was high in
   all included studies. Blood oxygenation {[}arterial partial pressure of
   oxygen (p(a)O(2))], ventilation {[}arterial partial pressure of carbon
   dioxide (p(a)CO(2))] and arterial blood pressure affected BOLD fMRI
   readouts across various experimental paradigms.
   Conclusions: Blood oxygenation, ventilation and arterial blood pressure
   should be monitored and maintained at stable physiological levels
   throughout experiments. Appropriate anaesthetic management and
   monitoring are crucial to obtain scientifically valid, reproducible
   results from fMRI studies in rodent models.},

Title = {Improving fMRI reliability in presurgical mapping for brain tumours},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {87},

Abstract = {Purpose Functional MRI (fMRI) is becoming increasingly integrated into
   clinical practice for presurgical mapping. Current efforts are focused
   on validating data quality, with reliability being a major factor. In
   this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a recently developed approach
   that uses receiver operating characteristic-reliability (ROC-r) to: (1)
   identify reliable versus unreliable data sets; (2) automatically select
   processing options to enhance data quality; and (3) automatically select
   individualised thresholds for activation maps.
   Methods Presurgical fMRI was conducted in 16 patients undergoing
   surgical treatment for brain tumours. Within-session test-retest fMRI
   was conducted, and ROC-reliability of the patient group was compared to
   a previous healthy control cohort. Individually optimised preprocessing
   pipelines were determined to improve reliability. Spatial correspondence
   was assessed by comparing the fMRI results to intraoperative cortical
   stimulation mapping, in terms of the distance to the nearest active fMRI
   voxel.
   Results The average ROC-r reliability for the patients was 0.58 +/-
   0.03, as compared to 0.72 +/- 0.02 in healthy controls. For the patient
   group, this increased significantly to 0.65 +/- 0.02 by adopting
   optimised preprocessing pipelines. Co-localisation of the fMRI maps with
   cortical stimulation was significantly better for more reliable versus
   less reliable data sets (8.3 +/- 0.9 vs 29 +/- 3 mm, respectively).
   Conclusions We demonstrated ROC-r analysis for identifying reliable fMRI
   data sets, choosing optimal postprocessing pipelines, and selecting
   patient-specific thresholds. Data sets with higher reliability also
   showed closer spatial correspondence to cortical stimulation. ROC-r can
   thus identify poor fMRI data at time of scanning, allowing for repeat
   scans when necessary. ROC-r analysis provides optimised and automated
   fMRI processing for improved presurgical mapping.},

Title = {Brain fMRI segmentation under emotion stimuli incorporating
   attention-based deep convolutional neural networks},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {122},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used for clinical
   examinations, diagnosis, and treatment. By segmenting fMRI images,
   large-scale medical image data can be processed more efficiently. Most
   deep learning (DL)-based segmentation typically uses some type of
   encoding-decoding model. In this study, affective computing (AC) was
   developed using the brain fMRI dataset generated from an emotion
   simulation experiment. The brain fMRI dataset was segmented using an
   attention model, a deep convolutional neural network-32 (DCNN-32) based
   on Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter, called ADCNN-32-G. For the
   evaluation of image segmentation, several indices are presented. By
   comparing the proposed ADCNN-32s-G model to distance regularized level
   set evolution (DRLSE), single-seeded region growing, and the single
   segNet full convolutional network model (FCN), the proposed model
   performs well in segmenting mass fMRI datasets. The proposed method can
   be applied to the real-time monitoring of patients with depression, and
   it can effectively advise human mental health. (C)\& nbsp;2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {Brain imaging efforts are being increasingly devoted to decode the
   functioning of the human brain. Among neuroimaging techniques,
   resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) is currently expanding exponentially. Beyond
   the general neuroimaging analysis packages (e.g., SPM, AFNI and FSL),
   REST and DPARSF were developed to meet the increasing need of
   user-friendly toolboxes for R-fMRI data processing. To address recently
   identified methodological challenges of R-fMRI, we introduce the newly
   developed toolbox, DPABI, which was evolved from REST and DPARSF. DPABI
   incorporates recent research advances on head motion control and
   measurement standardization, thus allowing users to evaluate results
   using stringent control strategies. DPABI also emphasizes test-retest
   reliability and quality control of data processing. Furthermore, DPABI
   provides a user-friendly pipeline analysis toolkit for rat/monkey R-fMRI
   data analysis to reflect the rapid advances in animal imaging. In
   addition, DPABI includes preprocessing modules for task-based fMRI,
   voxel-based morphometry analysis, statistical analysis and results
   viewing. DPABI is designed to make data analysis require fewer manual
   operations, be less time-consuming, have a lower skill requirement, a
   smaller risk of inadvertent mistakes, and be more comparable across
   studies. We anticipate this open-source toolbox will assist novices and
   expert users alike and continue to support advancing R-fMRI methodology
   and its application to clinical translational studies.},

Abstract = {Identifying brain biomarkers of disease risk is a growing priority in
   neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is limited
   by measurement reliability; unreliable measures are unsuitable for
   predicting clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task
   functional MRI (fMRI) is a major focus of biomarker development;
   however, the reliability of task fMRI has not been systematically
   evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability
   of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments (N =
   1,008) revealed poor overall reliability-mean intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC) = .397. Second, the test-retest reliabilities of
   activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 common fMRI tasks
   collected by the Human Connectome Project (N = 45) and the Dunedin Study
   (N = 20) were poor (ICCs = .067-.485). Collectively, these findings
   demonstrate that common task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable
   for brain biomarker discovery or for individual-differences research. We
   review how this state of affairs came to be and highlight avenues for
   improving task-fMRI reliability.},

   stands to revolutionize our understanding of cognitive development. By

   the limitations of behavioral measures. We discuss example domains where
   this approach could be fruitful, including episodic memory, semantic
   cognition, spatial representations, and theory of mind. In these and

Title = {Multitask fMRI Data Classification via Group-wise Hybrid Temporal and
   Spatial Sparse Representations},
Journal = {ENEURO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRl) has been widely
   used to induce functional brain activities corresponding to various
   cognitive tasks. A relatively under-explored question is whether there
   exist fundamental differences in fMRI signal composition patterns that
   can effectively classify the task states of tfMRl data, furthermore,
   whether there exist key functional components in characterizing the
   diverse tfMRl signals. Recently, fMRI signal composition patterns of
   multiple tasks have been investigated via deep learning models, where
   relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable and the
   neurologic meaning of their results is elusive. Thus, the major
   challenges arise from the high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise
   ratio, interindividual variability, a small sample size of fMRI data,
   and the explainability of classification results. To address the above
   challenges, we proposed a computational framework based on group-wise
   hybrid temporal and spatial sparse representations (HTSSR) to identify
   and differentiate multitask fMRI signal composition patterns. Using
   relatively small cohorts of Human Connectome Project (HCP) tfMRl data as
   test-bed, the experimental results demonstrated that the multitask of
   fMRI data can be successfully classified with an average accuracy of
   96.67\%, where the key components in differentiating the multitask can
   be characterized, suggesting the effectiveness and explainability of the
   proposed method. Moreover, both task-related components and
   resting-state networks (RSNs) can be reliably detected. Therefore, our
   study proposed a novel framework that identifies the interpretable and
   discriminative fMRI composition patterns and can be potentially applied
   for controlling fMRI data quality and inferring biomarkers in brain
   disorders with small sample neuroimaging datasets.},

   quality using a time-dependent deep neural network},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) is a prominent imaging technique to probe brain
   function, however, a substantial proportion of noise from multiple
   sources influences the reliability and reproducibility of fMRI data
   analysis and limits its clinical applications. Extensive effort has been
   devoted to improving fMRI data quality, but in the last two decades,
   there is no consensus reached which technique is more effective. In this
   study, we developed a novel deep neural network for denoising fMRI data,
   named denoising neural network (DeNN). This deep neural network is 1)
   applicable without requiring externally recorded data to model noise; 2)
   spatially and temporally adaptive to the variability of noise in
   different brain regions at different time points; 3) automated to output
   denoised data without manual interference; 4) trained and applied on
   each subject separately and 5) insensitive to the repetition time (TR)
   of fMRI data. When we compared DeNN with a number of nuisance regression
   methods for denoising fMRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) database, only DeNN had connectivity for functionally
   uncorrelated regions close to zero and successfully identified unbiased
   correlations between the posterior cingulate cortex seed and multiple
   brain regions within the default mode network or task positive network.
   The whole brain functional connectivity maps computed with DeNN-denoised
   data are approximately three times as homogeneous as the functional
   connectivity maps computed with raw data. Furthermore, the improved
   homogeneity strengthens rather than weakens the statistical power of
   fMRI in detecting intrinsic functional differences between cognitively

Title = {Assessment of olfactory information in the human brain using 7-Tesla
   functional magnetic resonance imaging},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {236},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Olfaction could prove to be an early marker of neurodegenerative
   diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. To use
   olfaction for disease diagnosis, elucidating the standard olfactory
   functions in healthy humans is necessary. However, the olfactory
   function in the human brain is less frequently assessed because of
   methodological difficulties associated with olfactory-related cerebral
   areas. Using ultra-high fields (UHF), functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) with high spatial resolution and sensitivity may allow
   for the measurement of activation in the cerebral areas. This study
   aimed to apply 7-Tesla fMRI to assess olfactory function in the human
   brain by exposing individuals to four different odorants for 8 s. We
   found that olfactory stimulation mainly activated the piriform and
   orbitofrontal cortex in addition to the amygdala. Among these regions,
   univariate fMRI analysis indicated that subjective odor intensity
   significantly correlated with the averaged fMRI signals in the piriform
   cortex but not with subjective hedonic tone in any region. In contrast,
   multivariate fMRI analysis showed that subjective hedonic tone could be
   discriminated from the fMRI response patterns in the posterior
   orbitofrontal cortex. Thus, the piriform cortex is mainly associated
   with subjective odor intensity, whereas the posterior orbitofrontal
   cortex are involved in the discrimination of the subjective hedonic tone
   of the odorant. UHF-fMRI may be useful for assessing olfactory function
   in the human brain.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the
   most important neuroimaging techniques; nevertheless, the acoustic noise
   of the MR scanner is unavoidably linked to the process of data
   acquisition. We hypothesized that the auditory noise of the scanner has
   an effect on autonomic activity. Methods: We measured heart rate
   variability (HRV) while exposing 30 healthy subjects to fMRI noise. In
   doing so, we demonstrated an increase in parasympathetic nervous system
   (PNS) activity compared to silence and white noise and a decrease in
   sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity compared to white noise.
   Conclusions: The influence of MR scanner noise on the autonomic nervous
   system should be taken into account when performing fMRI experiments.},

Abstract = {This article describes a case of Foreign accent syndrome (FAS) in an
   Italian woman who developed a Canadian-like foreign accent without brain
   damage (functional FAS). The patient underwent an in-depth neuroimaging
   and (neuro)psychological evaluation. Language networks in the
   frontotemporal-parietal areas were typically activated bilaterally
   through fMRI and MEG assessments based on task-based data. Resting-state
   fMRI showed preserved connectivity between language areas. An
   obsessive-compulsive personality profile and mild anxiety were found,
   suggesting psychological and psychiatric factors may be relevant.
   Accordingly with our findings, multimodal imaging is beneficial to
   understand FAS neurological and functional etiologies.},

Title = {A multivariate comparison of electroencephalogram and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to electrocorticogram using visual object
   representations in humans},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Today, most neurocognitive studies in humans employ the non-invasive
   neuroimaging techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   electroencephalogram (EEG). However, how the data provided by fMRI and
   EEG relate exactly to the underlying neural activity remains
   incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to understand the relation
   between EEG and fMRI data at the level of neural population codes using
   multivariate pattern analysis. In particular, we assessed whether this
   relation is affected when we change stimuli or introduce
   identity-preserving variations to them. For this, we recorded EEG and
   fMRI data separately from 21 healthy participants while participants
   viewed everyday objects in different viewing conditions, and then
   related the data to electrocorticogram (ECoG) data recorded for the same
   stimulus set from epileptic patients. The comparison of EEG and ECoG
   data showed that object category signals emerge swiftly in the visual
   system and can be detected by both EEG and ECoG at similar temporal
   delays after stimulus onset. The correlation between EEG and ECoG was
   reduced when object representations tolerant to changes in scale and
   orientation were considered. The comparison of fMRI and ECoG overall
   revealed a tighter relationship in occipital than in temporal regions,
   related to differences in fMRI signal-to-noise ratio. Together, our
   results reveal a complex relationship between fMRI, EEG, and ECoG
   signals at the level of population codes that critically depends on the
   time point after stimulus onset, the region investigated, and the visual
   contents used.},

Title = {Deep learning for brain disorder diagnosis based on fMRI images},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {469},
Pages = {332-345},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {In modern neuroscience and clinical study, neuroscientists and
   clinicians often use non-invasive imaging techniques to validate
   theories and computational models, observe brain activities and diagnose
   brain disorders. The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one
   of the commonly-used imaging modalities that can be used to understand
   human brain mechanisms as well as the diagnosis and treatment of brain
   disorders. The advances in artificial intelligence and the emergence of
   deep learning techniques have shown promising results to better
   interpret fMRI data. Deep learning techniques have rapidly become the
   state of the art for analyzing fMRI data sets and resulted in
   performance improvements in diverse fMRI applications. Deep learning is
   normally presented as an end-to-end learning process and can alleviate
   feature engineering requirements and hence reduce domain knowledge
   requirements to some extent. Under the framework of deep learning, fMRI
   data can be considered as images, time series or images series. Hence,
   different deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks,
   recurrent neural network, or a combination of both, can be developed to
   process fMRI data for different tasks. In this review, we discussed the
   basics of deep learning methods and focused on its successful
   implementations for brain disorder diagnosis based on fMRI images. The
   goal is to provide a high-level overview of brain disorder diagnosis
   with fMRI images from the perspective of deep learning applications. (c)

Abstract = {Current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data modeling
   techniques, such as independent component analysis and sparse coding
   methods, can effectively reconstruct dozens or hundreds of concurrent
   interacting functional brain networks simultaneously from the whole
   brain fMRI signals. However, such reconstructed networks have no
   correspondences across different subjects. Thus, automatic, effective,
   and accurate classification and recognition of these large numbers of
   fMRI-derived functional brain networks are very important for subsequent
   steps of functional brain analysis in cognitive and clinical
   neuroscience applications. However, this task is still a challenging and
   open problem due to the tremendous variability of various types of
   functional brain networks and the presence of various sources of noises.
   In recognition of the fact that convolutional neural networks (CNN) has
   superior capability of representing spatial patterns with huge
   variability and dealing with large noises, in this paper, we design,
   apply, and evaluate a deep 3-D CNN framework for automatic, effective,
   and accurate classification and recognition of large number of
   functional brain networks reconstructed by sparse representation of
   whole-brain fMRI signals. Our extensive experimental results based on
   the Human Connectome Project fMRI data showed that the proposed deep 3-D
   CNN can effectively and robustly perform functional networks
   classification and recognition tasks, while maintaining a high tolerance
   for mistakenly labeled training instances. This study provides a new
   deep learning approach for modeling functional connectomes based on fMRI
   data.},

Title = {Influence of physiological noise on accelerated 2D and 3D resting state
   functional MRI data at 7T},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {78},

Pages = {888-896},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {PurposePhysiological noise often dominates the blood-oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations in high-field functional MRI
   (fMRI) data. Therefore, to optimize fMRI protocols, it becomes crucial
   to investigate how physiological signal fluctuations impact various
   acquisition and reconstruction schemes at different acquisition speeds.
   In particular, further differences can arise between 2D and 3D fMRI
   acquisitions due to different encoding strategies, thereby impacting
   fMRI sensitivity in potentially significant ways.
   MethodsThe amount of physiological noise to be removed from the BOLD
   fMRI signal acquired at 7T was quantified for different sampling rates
   (repetition time from 3300 to 350 ms, acceleration 1 to 8) and
   techniques dedicated to fast fMRI (simultaneous multislice echo planar
   imaging {[}EPI] and 3D EPI). Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) performances
   were evaluated using temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and network
   characterization based on seed correlation and independent component
   analysis.
   ResultsOverall, acceleration enhanced tSNR and rsfMRI metrics. 3D EPI
   benefited the most from physiological noise removal at long repetition
   times. Differences between 2D and 3D encoding strategies disappeared at
   high acceleration factors (6- to 8-fold).
   ConclusionAfter physiological noise correction, 2D- and 3D-accelerated
   sequences provide similar performances at high fields, both in terms of
   tSNR and resting state network identification and characterization. Magn

   based on Independent Component Analysis},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Accurate delineation of gliomas from the surrounding normal brain areas
   helps maximize tumor resection and improves outcome.
   Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) has been
   routinely adopted for presurgical mapping of the surrounding functional
   areas. For completely utilizing such imaging data, here we show the
   feasibility of using presurgical fMRI for tumor delineation. In
   particular, we introduce a novel method dedicated to tumor detection
   based on independent component analysis (ICA) of resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) with automatic tumor component identification. Multi-center
   rs-fMRI data of 32 glioma patients from three centers, plus the
   additional proof-of-concept data of 28 patients from the fourth center
   with non-brain musculoskeletal tumors, are fed into individual ICA with
   different total number of components (TNCs). The best-fitted
   tumorrelated components derived from the optimized TNCs setting are
   automatically determined based on a new template-matching algorithm. The
   success rates are 100\%, 100\% and 93.75\% for glioma tissue detection
   for the three centers, respectively, and 85.19\% for musculoskeletal
   tumor detection. We propose that the high success rate could come from
   the previously overlooked ability of BOLD rs-fMRI in characterizing the
   abnormal vascularization, vasomotion and perfusion caused by tumors. Our
   findings suggest an additional usage of the rs-fMRI for comprehensive
   presurgical assessment.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is based
   on spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
   signal, which occur simultaneously in different brain regions, without
   the subject performing an explicit task. The low-frequency oscillations
   of the rs-fMRI signal demonstrate an intrinsic spatiotemporal
   organization in the brain (brain networks) that may relate to the
   underlying neural activity. In this review article, we briefly describe
   the current acquisition techniques for rs-fMRI data, from the most
   common approaches for resting state acquisition strategies, to more
   recent investigations with dedicated hardware and ultra-high fields.
   Specific sequences that allow very fast acquisitions, or multiple
   echoes, are discussed next. We then consider how acquisition methods
   weighted towards specific parts of the BOLD signal, like the Cerebral
   Blood Flow (CBF) or Volume (CBV), can provide more spatially specific
   network information. These approaches are being developed alongside the
   commonly used BOLD-weighted acquisitions. Finally, specific applications
   of rs-fMRI to challenging regions such as the laminae in the neocortex,
   and the networks within the large areas of subcortical white matter
   regions are discussed. We finish the review with recommendations for
   acquisition strategies for a range of typical applications of resting
   state fMRI.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography
   (MEG) are neuroimaging techniques that measure inherently different
   physiological processes, resulting in complementary estimates of brain
   activity in different regions. Combining the maps generated by each
   technique could thus provide a richer understanding of brain activation.
   However, present approaches to integration rely on a priori assumptions,
   such as expected patterns of brain activation in a task, or use fMRI to
   bias localization of MEG sources, diminishing fMRI-invisible sources. We
   aimed to optimize sensitivity to neural activity by developing a novel
   method of integrating data from the two imaging techniques. We present a
   data-driven method of integration that weights fMRI and MEG imaging data
   by estimates of data quality for each technique and region. This method
   was applied to a verbal object recognition task. As predicted, the two
   imaging techniques demonstrated sensitivity to activation in different
   regions. Activity was seen using fMRI, but not MEG, throughout the
   medial temporal lobes. Conversely, activation was seen using MEG, but
   not fMRI, in more lateral and anterior temporal lobe regions. Both
   imaging techniques were sensitive to activation in the inferior frontal
   gyrus. Importantly, integration maps retained activation from individual
   activation maps, and showed an increase in the extent of activation,
   owing to greater sensitivity of the integration map than either fMRI or
   MEG alone.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate topologies may serve as building
   blocks of functional brain activity in humans. Here, we studied the
   spatial and temporal correspondences between simultaneously acquired EEG
   microstate topologies and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)
   intrinsic networks in 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 14
   healthy age and sex matched controls. We found an anteriorisation of EEG
   microstates' topologies in AD patients compared with controls; this
   corresponded with reduced spatial expression of default mode and
   increased expression of frontal lobe networks in rs-fMRI. In a
   hierarchical cluster analysis the time courses of the EEG microstates
   were associated with the time courses of spatially corresponding rs-fMRI
   networks. We found prevalent negative correlations of time courses
   between anterior microstate topologies and posterior rs-fMRI components
   as well as between posterior microstate topology and anterior rs-fMRI
   components. These negative correlations were significantly more
   expressed in controls than in AD patients. In conclusion, our data
   support the notion that the time courses of EEG microstates underlie the
   temporal expression of rs-fMRI networks. Furthermore, our findings
   indicate that the anterior-to-posterior connectivity of microstates and
   rs-fMRI components may be reduced in AD, indicative of a break-down of
   long-reaching intrahemispheric connections.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Accurate epileptogenic zone (EZ) or seizure onset zone (SOZ)
   localization is crucial for epilepsy surgery optimiza-tion. Previous
   animal and human studies on epilepsy have reported that changes in blood
   oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals induced by epileptic events could
   be used as diagnostic markers for EZ or SOZ localization. Si-multaneous
   electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (EEG-fMRI) recording is gaining interest as a non-invasive tool for
   preoperative epilepsy evaluation. However, EEG-fMRI studies have
   reported inconsistent and ambiguous findings. Therefore, it remains
   unclear whether BOLD responses can be used for accurate EZ or SOZ
   localization. In this study, we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in
   a rat model of 4-aminopyridine-induced acute focal seizures to assess
   the spatial concordance between individual BOLD responses and the SOZ.
   This was to determine the optimal use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording
   in the SOZ localization. We observed a high spatial consistency between
   BOLD responses and the SOZ. Further, dynamic BOLD responses were
   consistent with the regions where the seizures were propagated. These
   results suggested that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording could be used as
   a noninvasive clinical diagnostic technique for localizing the EZ or SOZ
   and could be an effective tool for mapping epileptic networks.},

Abstract = {The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) describes the regional
   intensity of spontaneous blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). How the
   fMRI-ALFF relates to the amplitude in electrophysiological signals
   remains unclear. We here aimed to investigate the neural correlates of
   fMRI-ALFF by comparing the spatial difference of amplitude between the
   eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) states from fMRI and
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), respectively. By synthesizing MEG signal
   into amplitude-based envelope time course, we first investigated 2 types
   of amplitude in MEG, meaning the amplitude of neural activities from
   delta to gamma (i.e. MEG-amplitude) and the amplitude of their
   low-frequency modulation at the fMRI range (i.e. MEG-ALFF). We observed
   that the MEG-ALFF in EC was increased at parietal sensors, ranging from
   alpha to beta; whereas the MEG-amplitude in EC was increased at the
   occipital sensors in alpha. Source-level analysis revealed that the
   increased MEG-ALFF in the sensorimotor cortex overlapped with the most
   reliable EC-EO differences observed in fMRI at slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz),
   and these differences were more significant after global mean

Abstract = {High dimensionality data have become common in neuroimaging fields,
   especially group-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   datasets. fMRI connectivity analysis is a widely used, powerful
   technique for studying functional brain networks to probe underlying
   mechanisms of brain function and neuropsychological disorders. However,
   data-driven technique like independent components analysis (ICA), can
   yield unstable and inconsistent results, confounding the true effects of
   interest and hindering the understanding of brain functionality and
   connectivity. A key contributing factor to this instability is the
   information loss that occurs during fMRI data reduction. Data reduction
   of high dimensionality fMRI data in the temporal domain to identify the
   important information within group datasets is necessary for such
   analyses and is crucial to ensure the accuracy and stability of the
   outputs. In this study, we describe an fMRI data reduction strategy
   based on an adapted neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) algorithm.
   Both simulated and real data results indicate that, compared with the
   widely used data reduction method, principal component analysis, the
   NPE-based data reduction method (a) shows superior performance on
   efficient data reduction, while enhancing group-level information, (b)
   develops a unique stratagem for selecting components based on an
   adjacency graph of eigenvectors, (c) generates more reliable and
   reproducible brain networks under different model orders when the
   outputs of NPE are used for ICA, (d) is more sensitive to revealing
   task-evoked activation for task fMRI, and (e) is extremely attractive
   and powerful for the increasingly popular fast fMRI and very large
   datasets.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Previous literature has demonstrated disparity in
   the postoperative recovery of first and second language function of
   bilingual neurosurgical patients. However, it is unclear to whether
   preoperative brain mapping of both languages is needed. In this study,
   we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of language task functional
   MRI (fMRI) implemented in both languages in bilingual patients.
   METHODS We retrospectively examined fMRI data of 13 bilingual brain
   tumor patients (age: 23 to 59 years) who performed antonym generation
   task-based fMRIs in English and non-English language. The usefulness of
   bilingual language mapping was evaluated using a structured survey
   administered to 5 neurosurgeons. Additionally, quantitative comparison
   between the brain activation maps of both languages was performed.
   RESULTS Survey responses revealed differences in raters' surgical
   approach, including asleep versus awake surgery and extent of resection,
   after viewing the language fMRI maps. Additional non-English fMRI led to
   changes in surgical decision-making and bettered localization of
   language areas. Quantitative analysis revealed an increase in laterality
   index (LI) in non-English fMRI compared to English fMRI. The Dice
   coefficient demonstrated fair overlap (.458 +/- .160) between the
   activation maps.
   CONCLUSION Bilingual fMRI mapping of bilingual patients allows to better
   appreciate functionally active language areas that may be neglected in
   single language mapping. Utility of bilingual mapping was supported by
   changes in both surgical approach and LI measurements, suggesting its
   benefit on preoperative language mapping.},

Abstract = {Background: Adult-attention-deficit-hyperactive-disorder (ADHD) is often
   unrecognized condition. FMRI examination along with neuropsychological
   testing might strengthen the diagnosis. We hypothesized that ADHD-adults
   with and without medication would show different fMRI pattern compared
   to healthy controls while testing tasks of motor inhibition and
   cognitive switching.
   Methods: 45 subjects in three age-matched groups: (1) controls, (2)
   ADHD-adults under medication (ADHD+) and (3) medication-naive adults
   with ADHD (ADHD-) underwent fMRI and neuropsychological testing. Group
   analysis and population-based statistics were performed.
   Results: DTVP-A, intellectual ability as well as attention capability,
   visual-perceptual and visual-motor abilities showed no significant
   differences between the groups. However, fMRI revealed statistically
   significant differences between the ADHD+, ADHD- and control groups on
   tasks of motor inhibition and cognitive switching on adults in bilateral
   fronto-striatal brain regions, inferior fronto-frontal, fronto-cingulate
   and fronto-parietal networks as well as in the parietal lobe (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: fMRI offers the potential to differentiate between the
   ADHD+, ADHD- and control groups. FMRI possibly opens a new window for
   monitoring the therapeutic effect of ADHD medication.},

Journal = {HUMAN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by altered social
   cognition. The importance of social cognition has previously been
   recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain
   Criteria project, in which it features as a core domain. Social
   task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) currently offers
   the most direct insight into how the brain processes social information;
   however, resting-state fMRI may be just as important in understanding
   the biology and network nature of social processing. Resting-state fMRI
   allows researchers to investigate the functional relationships between
   brain regions in a neutral state: so-called resting functional
   connectivity (RFC). There is evidence that RFC is predictive of how the
   brain processes information during social tasks. This is important
   because it shifts the focus from possibly context-dependent aberrations
   to context-independent aberrations in functional network architecture.
   Rather than being analysed in isolation, the study of resting-state
   brain networks shows promise in linking results of task-based fMRI
   results, structural connectivity, molecular imaging findings, and
   performance measures of social cognition-which may prove crucial in
   furthering our understanding of the social brain.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in rodents holds great
   promise for advancing our knowledge about human brain function. However,
   the use of anesthetics to immobilize rodents during fMRI experiments has
   restricted the type of questions that can be addressed using this
   technique. Here we describe an innovative procedure to train rats to be
   constrained without the need of any anesthesia during the whole
   procedure. We show that with 8-10 days of acclimation rats can be
   conscious and remain still during fMRI experiments under minimal stress.
   In addition, we provide fMRI results of conscious rodents in a variety
   of commonly used fMRI experimental paradigms, and we demonstrate the
   improved quality of these scans by comparing results when the same
   rodents were scanned under anesthesia. We confirm that the awake
   scanning procedure permits an improved evaluation of brain networks and
   brain response to external stimuli with minimal movement artifact. The
   present study further advances the field of fMRI in awake rodents, which
   provide more direct, forward and reverse, translational opportunities
   regarding brain functional correspondences between human and rodent
   research.},

Title = {A Multisensory fMRI Investigation of Nociceptive-Preferential Cortical
   Regions and Responses},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {The existence of nociceptive-specific brain regions has been a
   controversial issue for decades. Multisensory fMRI studies, which
   examine fMRI activities in response to various types of sensory
   stimulation, could help identify nociceptive-specific brain regions, but
   previous studies are limited by sample size and they did not
   differentiate nociceptive-specific regions and nociceptive-preferential
   regions, which have significantly larger responses to nociceptive input.
   In this study, we conducted a multisensory fMRI experiment on 80 healthy
   participants, with the aim to determine whether there are certain brain
   regions that specifically or preferentially respond to nociceptive
   stimulation. By comparing the evoked fMRI responses across four sensory
   modalities, we found a series of brain regions specifically or
   preferentially involved in nociceptive sensory input. Particularly, we
   found different parts of some cortical regions, such as insula and
   cingulate gyrus, play different functional roles in the processing of
   nociceptive stimulation. Hence, this multisensory study improves our
   understanding of the functional integrations and segregations of the
   nociceptive-related regions.},

Title = {Default mode and visual network activity in an attention task: Direct
   measurement with intracranial EEG},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Dynamic attention states are necessary to navigate the ever changing
   task demands of daily life. Previous investigations commonly utilize a
   block paradigm to study sustained and transient changes in attention
   networks. fMRI investigations have shown that sustained attention in
   visual block design attention tasks corresponds to decreased signal in
   the default mode and visual processing networks. While task negative
   networks are anticipated to decrease during active task engagement, it
   is unexpected that visual networks would also be suppressed during a
   visual task where event-related fMRI studies have found transient
   increases to visual stimuli. To resolve these competing results, the
   current investigations utilized intracranial EEG to directly interrogate
   visual and default mode network dynamics during a visual continuous
   performance task. We used the electrophysiological data to model
   expected fMRI signals and to maximize interpretation of current results
   with previous investigations. Results show broadband gamma power
   decreases in the default mode network, corresponding to previous EEG and
   fMRI findings. Meanwhile, visual processing regions including the
   primary visual cortex and fusiform gyrus demonstrate both sustained
   decreases during task engagement and stimuli-driven transient increases
   in gamma power. Modeled fMRI based on gamma power reproduces signal
   decreases reported in the fMRI literature, and emphasizes the
   insensitivity of fMRI to transient, regularly spaced signal changes
   embedded within sustained network dynamics. The signal processing
   functions of the dynamic visual and default mode network changes
   explored in this study are unknown but may be elucidated through further
   investigation.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful way to
   visualize brain functions and observe brain activity in response to
   tasks or thoughts. It allows displaying brain damages that can be
   quantified and linked to neurobehavioral deficits. fMRI can potentially
   draw a new cartography of brain functional areas, allow us to understand
   aspects of brain function evolution or even breach the wall into
   cognition and consciousness. However, fMRI is not deprived of pitfalls,
   such as limitation in spatial resolution, poor reproducibility,
   different time scales of fMRI measurements and neuron action potentials,
   low statistical values. Thus, caution is needed in the assessment of
   fMRI results and conclusions. Additional diagnostic techniques based on
   MRI such as arterial spin labeling (ASL) and the measurement of
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provide new tools to assess normal brain
   development or disruption of anatomical networks in diseases. A cutting
   edge of recent research uses fMRI techniques to establish a ``map{''} of
   neural connections in the brain, or ``connectome{''}. It will help to
   develop a map of neural connections and thus understand the operation of
   the network. New applications combining fMRI and real time visualization
   of one's own brain activity (rtfMRl) could empower individuals to modify
   brain response and thus could enable researchers or institutions to
   intervene in the modification of an individual behavior. The latter in
   particular, as well as the concern about the confidentiality and storage
   of sensitive information or fMRI and lie detectors forensic use, raises
   new ethical questions.},

Abstract = {The combination of optogenetic control and fMRI readout in the brain is
   increasingly used to assess neuronal networks and underlying signal
   processing. However, how exactly optogenetic activation or inhibition
   reproduces normal physiological input has not been fully unraveled. To
   assess details of temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response,
   temporal resolution in rodent fMRI is often not sufficient. Recent
   advances in human fMRI using faster acquisition schemes cannot be easily
   translated to small animals due to smaller dimensions, fast
   physiological motion, and higher sensitivity to artefacts. Here, we
   applied a one dimensional line scanning acquisition with 50 ms temporal
   resolution in rat somatosensory cortex. We observed that optogenetic
   activation reproduces the hemodynamic response upon sensory stimulation,
   but shows a 160 to 340 ms earlier onset of the response. This difference
   is explained by direct activation of all opsin-expressing and
   illuminated cortical layers, while hemodynamic response to sensory
   stimulation is delayed during intracortical transmission between
   cortical layers. Our results confirm that optogenetic activation is a
   valid model for physiological neuronal input, and that differences in
   temporal behavior of only a few hundred milliseconds can be resolved in
   rodent fMRI.},

Abstract = {Neural activity in early visual cortex is modulated by luminance
   contrast. Cortical depth (i.e., laminar) contrast responses have been
   studied in monkey early visual cortex, but not in humans. In addition to
   the high spatial resolution needed and the ensuing low signal-to-noise
   ratio, laminar studies in humans using fMRI are hampered by the strong
   venous vascular weighting of the fMRI signal. In this study, we measured
   luminance contrast responses in human V1 and V2 with high-resolution
   fMRI at 7 T. To account for the effect of intracortical ascending veins,
   we applied a novel spatial deconvolution model to the fMRI depth
   profiles. Before spatial deconvolution, the contrast response in V1
   showed a slight local maximum at mid cortical depth, whereas V2
   exhibited a monotonic signal increase toward the cortical surface. After
   applying the deconvolution, both V1 and V2 showed a pronounced local
   maximum at mid cortical depth, with an additional peak in deep grey
   matter, especially in V1. Moreover, we found a difference in contrast
   sensitivity between V1 and V2, but no evidence for variations in
   contrast sensitivity as a function of cortical depth. These findings are
   in agreement with results obtained in nonhuman primates, but further
   research will be needed to validate the spatial deconvolution approach.},

Title = {Study of Resting-State Functional Connectivity Networks Using EEG
   Electrodes Position As Seed},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the standard diagnosis method for a wide
   variety of diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, encephalopathies,
   and coma, among others. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   (rs-fMRI) is currently a technique used in research in both healthy
   individuals as well as patients. EEG and fMRI are procedures used to
   obtain direct and indirect measurements of brain neural activity: EEG
   measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on
   the scalp, and fMRI detects the changes in blood oxygenation that occur
   in response to neural activity. EEG has a high temporal resolution and
   low spatial resolution, while fMRI has high spatial resolution and low
   temporal resolution. Thus, the combination of EEG with rs-fMRI using
   different methods could be very useful for research and clinical
   applications. In this article, we describe and show the results of a new
   methodology for processing rs-fMRI using seeds positioned according to
   the 10-10 EEG standard. We analyze the functional connectivity and
   adjacency matrices obtained using 65 seeds based on 10-10 EEG scheme and
   21 seeds based on 10-20 EEG. Connectivity networks are created using
   each 10-20 EEG seeds and are analyzed by comparisons to the seven
   networks that have been found in recent studies. The proposed method
   captures high correlation between contralateral seeds, ipsilateral and
   contralateral occipital seeds, and some in the frontal lobe.},

Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rest-f-MRI) is a
   neuroimaging technique that has demonstrated its potential in providing
   new insights into brain physiology. rest-f-MRI can provide useful
   information in pre-surgical mapping aimed to balancing long-term
   survival by maximizing the extent of resection of brain neoplasms, while
   preserving the patient's functional connectivity. Rest-fMRI may replace
   or can be complementary to task-driven fMRI (t-fMRI), particularly in
   patients unable to cooperate with the task paradigm, such as children or
   sedated, paretic, aphasic patients. Although rest-fMRI is still under
   standardization, this technique has been demonstrated to be feasible and
   valuable in the routine clinical setting for neurosurgical planning,
   along with intraoperative electrocortical mapping. In the literature,
   there is growing evidence that rest-fMRI can provide valuable
   information for the depiction of glioma-related functional brain network
   impairment. Accordingly, rest-fMRI could allow a tailored glioma surgery
   improving the surgeon's ability to increase the extent of resection
   (EOR), and simultaneously minimize the risk of damage of eloquent brain
   structures and neuronal networks responsible for the integrity of
   executive functions. In this article, we present a review of the
   literature and illustrate the feasibility of rest-fMRI in the clinical
   setting for presurgical mapping of eloquent networks in patients
   affected by brain tumors, before and after tumor resection.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique used to infer neuronal activity
   from the observed changes in blood flow. Cerebrovascular reactivity
   (CVR) is the ability of arterioles to increase blood flow in response to
   vasodilatory stimulus. We hypothesize that in areas of disease where
   there is exhausted vascular reserve and impaired CVR there will be
   diminished blood flow response following neuronal activation, and that
   these areas would appear as false-negative tests on BOLD fMRI. Materials
   and Methods: Patients with steno-occlusive disease and unilateral
   hemodynamic impairment received a standardized hypercapnic stimuli while
   being imaged with BOLD fMRI to generate CVR maps. These were compared to
   traditional BOLD fMRI maps of neuronal activation in the motor cortex in
   response to a motor task. Results: Neuronal activation from the motor
   task was found to be linearly correlated with CVR (n511 patients,
   R50.82). Regions with positive (normal) CVR showed positive activation
   on BOLD fMRI, while regions with negative CVR had attenuated neuronal
   activation on BOLD fMRI. Conclusion: In areas with cerebrovascular
   disease where CVR is impaired, there is uncoupling of neuronal
   activation and blood flow that confounds traditional BOLD fMRI. CVR
   mapping is a noninvasive MRI-based imaging technique that can provide
   information about the vascular reactivity of the brain that is important
   to consider when interpreting traditional BOLD fMRI studies. Level of
   Evidence: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3},

Title = {Quality control in resting-state fMRI: the benefits of visual inspection},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Background A variety of quality control (QC) approaches are employed in
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to
   determine data quality and ultimately inclusion or exclusion of a fMRI
   data set in group analysis. Reliability of rs-fMRI data can be improved
   by censoring or ``scrubbing{''} volumes affected by motion. While
   censoring preserves the integrity of participant-level data, including
   excessively censored data sets in group analyses may add noise.
   Quantitative motion-related metrics are frequently reported in the
   literature; however, qualitative visual inspection can sometimes catch
   errors or other issues that may be missed by quantitative metrics alone.
   In this paper, we describe our methods for performing QC of rs-fMRI data
   using software-generated quantitative and qualitative output and trained
   visual inspection.Results The data provided for this QC paper had
   relatively low motion-censoring, thus quantitative QC resulted in no
   exclusions. Qualitative checks of the data resulted in limited
   exclusions due to potential incidental findings and failed
   pre-processing scripts.Conclusion Visual inspection in addition to the
   review of quantitative QC metrics is an important component to ensure
   high quality and accuracy in rs-fMRI data analysis.},

Abstract = {Analysis of task-based fMRI data is conventionally carried out using a
   hypothesis-driven approach, where blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)
   time courses are correlated with a hypothesized temporal structure. In
   some experimental designs, this temporal structure can be difficult to
   define. In other cases, experimenters may wish to take a more
   exploratory, data-driven approach to detecting task-driven BOLD
   activity. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency and power of an
   inter-subject synchronization approach for exploratory analysis of
   task-based fMRI data. Combining the tools of instantaneous phase
   synchronization and independent component analysis, we characterize
   whole-brain task-driven responses in terms of group-wise similarity in
   temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this framework to
   fMRI data collected during performance of a simple motor task and a
   social cognitive task. Analyses using an inter-subject phase
   synchronization approach revealed a large number of brain networks that
   dynamically synchronized to various features of the task, often not
   predicted by the hypothesized temporal structure of the task. We suggest
   that this methodological framework, along with readily available tools
   in the fMRI community, provides a powerful exploratory, data-driven
   approach for analysis of task-driven BOLD activity.},

Abstract = {Little is known about how language functional MRI (fMRI) is executed in
   clinical practice in spite of its widespread use. Here we
   comprehensively documented its execution in surgical planning in
   epilepsy. A questionnaire focusing on cognitive design, image
   acquisition, analysis and interpretation, and practical considerations
   was developed. Individuals responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
   interpreting clinical language fMRI data at 63 epilepsy surgical
   programs responded. The central finding was of marked heterogeneity in
   all aspects of fMRI. Most programs use multiple tasks, with a fifth
   routinely using 2, 3, 4, or 5 tasks with a modal run duration of 5 min.
   Variants of over 15 protocols are in routine use with forms of noun-verb
   generation, verbal fluency, and semantic decision-making used most
   often. Nearly all aspects of data acquisition and analysis vary
   markedly. Neither of the two best-validated protocols was used by more
   than 10\% of respondents. Preprocessing steps are broadly consistent
   across sites, language-related blood flow is most often identified using
   general linear modeling (76\% of respondents), and statistical
   thresholding typically varies by patient (79\%). The software SPM is
   most often used. fMRI programs inconsistently include input from experts
   with all required skills (imaging, cognitive assessment, MR physics,
   statistical analysis, and brain-behavior relationships). These data
   highlight marked gaps between the evidence supporting fMRI and its
   clinical application. Teams performing language fMRI may benefit from
   evaluating practice with reference to the best-validated protocols to
   date and ensuring individuals trained in all aspects of fMRI are
   involved to optimize patient care.},

Abstract = {Identification of the language dominant hemisphere is an essential part
   of the evaluation of potential pediatric epilepsy surgery patients.
   Historically, language dominance has been determined using the
   intracarotid amobarbitol procedure (IAP), but use of functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanning is becoming more common. Few studies
   examine the correspondence between fMRI and IAP in pediatric samples.
   The current study examined the agreement of hemispheric lateralization
   as determined by fMRI and IAP in a consecutive sample of 10 pediatric
   patients with epilepsy evaluated for epilepsy surgery. Data showed a
   strong correlation between IAP and fMRI lateralilty indices (r = .91)
   and 70\% agreement in determination of hemispheric dominance, despite
   increased demonstration of bilateral or atypical language representation
   in this pediatric sample. Clinical implications and interpretation
   challenges are discussed. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sparse Group Bases for Multisubject fMRI Data},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {83379-83397},
Abstract = {Considering that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals
   from multiple subjects (MS) can be represented together as a sum of
   common and a sum of distinct rank-1 matrices, a new MS dictionary
   learning (DL) algorithm named sparse group (common + distinct) bases
   (sgBACES) is proposed. Unlike existing MS-DL algorithms that ignore fMRI
   data's prior information, it is formulated as a penalized plus
   constrained rank-1 matrix approximation, where l(1) norm-based adaptive
   sparse penalty, l(0) norm-based dictionary regularization, and lag-1
   based autocorrelation maximization have been introduced in the
   minimization problem. Besides, spatial dependence among neighbouring
   voxels has been exploited for fine-tuning the sparsity parameters. To my
   best knowledge, the sgBACES algorithm is the first to effectively take
   temporal and spatial prior information into account for an MS-fMRI-DL
   framework. It also has the advantage of not requiring a separate sparse
   coding stage. Studies based on synthetic and experimental fMRI datasets
   are used to compare the performance of sgBACES with the state-of-the-art
   algorithms in terms of correlation strength and computation time. It
   emerged that the proposed sgBACES algorithm enhanced the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) of the recovered time courses (TCs) and the precision of the
   recovered spatial maps (SMs). A 10.2\% increase in the mean correlation
   value over the ShSSDL algorithm is observed for motor-task based fMRI
   data.},

Title = {Adaptive Smoothing Based on Gaussian Processes Regression Increases the
   Sensitivity and Specificity of fMRI Data},

Abstract = {Temporal and spatial filtering of fMRI data is often used to improve
   statistical power. However, conventional methods, such as smoothing with
   fixed-width Gaussian filters, remove fine-scale structure in the data,
   necessitating a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.
   Specifically, smoothing may increase sensitivity (reduce noise and
   increase statistical power) but at the cost loss of specificity in that
   fine-scale structure in neural activity patterns is lost. Here, we
   propose an alternative smoothing method based on Gaussian processes (GP)
   regression for single subjects fMRI experiments. This method adapts the
   level of smoothing on a voxel by voxel basis according to the
   characteristics of the local neural activity patterns. GP-based fMRI
   analysis has been heretofore impractical owing to computational demands.
   Here, we demonstrate a new implementation of GP that makes it possible
   to handle the massive data dimensionality of the typical fMRI
   experiment. We demonstrate how GP can be used as a drop-in replacement
   to conventional preprocessing steps for temporal and spatial smoothing
   in a standard fMRI pipeline. We present simulated and experimental
   results that show the increased sensitivity and specificity compared to
   conventional smoothing strategies. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Objective To assess the ability of functional MRI (fMRI) to predict
   postoperative language decline compared to direct cortical stimulation
   (DCS) in epilepsy surgery patients. Methods In this prospective case
   series, 17 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had intracranial
   monitoring and resection from 2012 to 2016 with 1-year follow-up. All
   patients completed preoperative language fMRI, mapping with DCS of
   subdural electrodes, pre- and postoperative neuropsychological testing
   for language function, and resection. Changes in language function
   before and after surgery were assessed. fMRI activation and DCS
   electrodes in the resection were evaluated as potential predictors of
   language decline. Results Four of 17 patients (12 female; median
   {[}range] age, 43 {[}23-59] years) experienced postoperative language
   decline 1 year after surgery. Two of 4 patients had overlap of fMRI
   activation, language-positive electrodes in basal temporal regions
   (within 1 cm), and resection. Two had overlap between resection volume
   and fMRI activation, but not DCS. fMRI demonstrated 100\% sensitivity
   and 46\% specificity for outcome compared to DCS (50\% and 85\%,
   respectively). When fMRI and DCS language findings were concordant, the
   combined tests showed 100\% sensitivity and 75\% specificity for
   language outcome. Seizure-onset age, resection side, type, volume, or 1
   year seizure outcome did not predict language decline. <},

Abstract = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback is
   an experimental framework in which fMRI signals are presented to
   participants in a real-time manner to change their behaviors. Changes in
   behaviors after real-time fMRI neurofeedback are postulated to be caused
   by neural plasticity driven by the induction of specific targeted
   activities at the neuronal level (targeted neural plasticity model).
   However, some research groups argued that behavioral changes in
   conventional real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies are explained by
   alternative accounts, including the placebo effect and physiological
   artifacts. Recently, decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) has been developed
   as a result of adapting new technological advancements, including
   implicit neurofeedback and fMRI multivariate analyses. DecNef provides
   strong evidence for the targeted neural plasticity model while refuting
   the abovementioned alternative accounts. In this review, we first
   discuss how DecNef refutes the alternative accounts. Second, we propose
   a model that shows how targeted neural plasticity occurs at the neuronal
   level during DecNef training. Finally, we discuss computational and
   empirical evidence that supports the model. Clarification of the neural
   mechanisms of DecNef would lead to the development of more advanced fMRI
   neurofeedback methods that may serve as powerful tools for both basic
   and clinical research.},

Title = {Interpreting Intervention Induced Neuroplasticity with fMRI: The Case
   for Multimodal Imaging Strategies},
Journal = {NEURAL PLASTICITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Direct measurement of recovery from brain injury is an important goal in
   neurorehabilitation, and requires reliable, objective, and interpretable
   measures of changes in brain function, referred to generally as
   ``neuroplasticity.{''} One popular imaging modality for measuring
   neuroplasticity is task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (t-fMRI). In the field of neurorehabilitation, however, assessing
   neuroplasticity using t-fMRI presents a significant challenge. This
   commentary reviews t-fMRI changes commonly reported in patients with
   cerebral palsy or acquired brain injuries, with a focus on studies of
   motor rehabilitation, and discusses complexities surrounding their
   interpretations. Specifically, we discuss the difficulties in
   interpreting t-fMRI changes in terms of their underlying causes, that
   is, differentiating whether they reflect genuine reorganisation,
   neurological restoration, compensation, use of preexisting redundancies,
   changes in strategy, or maladaptive processes. Furthermore, we discuss
   the impact of heterogeneous disease states and essential t-fMRI
   processing steps on the interpretability of activation patterns. To
   better understand therapy-induced neuroplastic changes, we suggest that
   researchers utilising t-fMRI consider concurrently acquiring information
   from an additional modality, to quantify, for example, haemodynamic
   differences or microstructural changes. We outline a variety of such
   supplementary measures for investigating brain reorganisation and
   discuss situations in which they may prove beneficial to the
   interpretation of t-fMRI data.},

Abstract = {Levels of alertness are closely linked with human behavior and
   cognition. However, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   allows for investigating whole-brain dynamics during behavior and task
   engagement, concurrent measures of alertness (such as EEG or
   pupillometry) are often unavailable. Here, we extract a continuous,
   time-resolved marker of alertness from fMRI data alone. We demonstrate
   that this fMRI alertness marker, calculated in a short pre-stimulus
   interval, captures trial-to-trial behavioral responses to incoming
   sensory stimuli. In addition, we find that the prediction of both EEG
   and behavioral responses during the task may be accomplished using only
   a small fraction of fMRI voxels. Furthermore, we observe that accounting
   for alertness appears to increase the statistical detection of
   task-activated brain areas. These findings have broad implications for
   augmenting a large body of existing datasets with information about
   ongoing arousal states, enriching fMRI studies of neural variability in
   health and disease.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Functional MRI (fMRI) is clinically used for localization of
   eloquent cortex before surgical intervention, most commonly motor and
   language function in patients with tumors or epilepsy. In the pediatric
   population, special considerations for fMRI relate to limited
   examination tolerance, small head size, developing anatomy and
   physiology, and diverse potential abnormalities. In this article, we
   will highlight pearls and pitfalls of clinical pediatric fMRI including
   blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging principles, patient
   preparation, study acquisition, data postprocessing, and examination
   interpretation.
   CONCLUSION. Clinical fMRI is indicated for presurgical localization of
   eloquent cortex in patients with tumors, epilepsy, or other neurologic
   conditions and requires a solid understanding of technical
   considerations and data processing. In children, special approaches are
   needed for patient preparation as well as study design, acquisition, and
   interpretation. Radiologists should be cognizant of developmental
   neuroanatomy, causes of neuropathology, and capacity for neuroplasticity
   in the pediatric population.},

Title = {Sensitivity and specificity considerations for fMRI encoding, decoding,

Pages = {18-31},

Abstract = {Following rapid technological advances, ultra-high field functional MRI
   (fMRI) enables exploring correlates of neuronal population activity at
   an increasing spatial resolution. However, as the fMRI
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is a vascular signal,
   the spatial specificity of fMRI data is ultimately determined by the
   characteristics of the underlying vasculature. At 7 T, fMRI measurement
   parameters determine the relative contribution of the macro- and
   microvasculature to the acquired signal. Here we investigate how these
   parameters affect relevant high-end fMRI analyses such as encoding,
   decoding, and submillimeter mapping of voxel preferences in the human
   auditory cortex. Specifically, we compare a T-2{*} weighted fMRI
   dataset, obtained with 2D gradient echo (GE) EPI, to a predominantly T-2
   weighted dataset obtained with 3D GRASE. We first investigated the
   decoding accuracy based on two encoding models that represented
   different hypotheses about auditory cortical processing. This
   encoding/decoding analysis profited from the large spatial coverage and
   sensitivity of the T-2{*} weighted acquisitions, as evidenced by a
   significantly higher prediction accuracy in the GE-EPI dataset compared
   to the 3D GRASE dataset for both encoding models. The main disadvantage
   of the T-2{*} weighted GE-EPI dataset for encoding/decoding analyses was
   that the prediction accuracy exhibited cortical depth dependent vascular
   biases. However, we propose that the comparison of prediction accuracy
   across the different encoding models may be used as a post processing
   technique to salvage the spatial interpretability of the GE-EPI cortical
   depth-dependent prediction accuracy. Second, we explored the mapping of
   voxel preferences. Large-scale maps of frequency preference (i.e.,
   tonotopy) were similar across datasets, yet the GE-EPI dataset was
   preferable due to its larger spatial coverage and sensitivity. However,
   submillimeter tonotopy maps revealed biases in assigned frequency
   preference and selectivity for the GE-EPI dataset, but not for the 3D
   GRASE dataset. Thus, a T-2 weighted acquisition is recommended if high
   specificity in tonotopic maps is required. In conclusion, different fMRI
   acquisitions were better suited for different analyses. It is therefore
   critical that any sequence parameter optimization considers the eventual
   intended fMRI analyses and the nature of the neuroscience questions
   being asked.},

Title = {Higher and deeper: Bringing layer fMRI to association cortex},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent advances in fMRI have enabled non-invasive measurements of brain
   function in awake, behaving humans at unprecedented spatial resolutions,
   allowing us to separate activity in distinct cortical layers. While most
   layer fMRI studies to date have focused on primary cortices, we argue
   that the next big steps forward in our understanding of cognition will
   come from expanding this technology into higher-order association
   cortex, to characterize depth-dependent activity during increasingly
   sophisticated mental processes. We outline phenomena and theories ripe
   for investigation with layer fMRI, including perception and imagery,
   selective attention, and predictive coding. We discuss practical and
   theoretical challenges to cognitive applications of layer fMRI,
   including localizing regions of interest in the face of substantial
   anatomical heterogeneity across individuals, designing appropriate task
   paradigms within the confines of acquisition parameters, and generating
   hypotheses for higher-order brain regions where the laminar circuitry is
   less well understood. We consider how applying layer fMRI in association
   cortex may help inform computational models of brain function as well as
   shed light on consciousness and mental illness, and issue a call to arms
   to our fellow methodologists and neuroscientists to bring layer fMRI to
   this next frontier.},

Title = {Decision thresholding on fMRI activation maps using the Hilbert-Huang
   transform},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Objective. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) requires
   thresholds by which to identify brain regions with significant
   activation, particularly for experiments involving real-life paradigms.
   One conventional non-parametric approach to generating surrogate data
   involves decomposition of the original fMRI time series using the
   Fourier transform, after which the phase is randomized without altering
   the magnitude of individual frequency components. However, it has been
   reported that spontaneous brain signals could be non-stationary, which,
   if true, could lead to false-positive results. Approach. This paper
   introduces a randomization procedure based on the Hilbert-Huang
   transform by which to account for non-stationarity in fMRI time series
   derived from two fMRI datasets (stationary or non-stationary). The
   significance of individual voxels was determined by comparing the
   distribution of empirical data versus a surrogate distribution. Main
   results. In a comparison with conventional phase-randomization and
   wavelet-based permutation methods, the proposed method proved highly
   effective in generating activation maps indicating essential brain
   regions, while filtering out noise in the white matter. Significance.
   This work demonstrated the importance of considering the non-stationary
   nature of fMRI time series when selecting resampling methods by which to
   probe brain activity or identify functional networks in real-life fMRI
   experiments. We propose a statistical testing method to deal with the
   non-stationarity of continuous brain signals.},

Title = {Odor Canopy: A Method for Comfortable Odorant Delivery in MRI},
Journal = {CHEMICAL SENSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the leading
   method for measuring the human brain response to sensory stimuli.
   However, olfaction fMRI lags behind vision and audition fMRI for 2
   primary reasons: First, the olfactory brain areas are particularly
   susceptible to imaging artifacts, and second, the olfactory stimulus is
   particularly difficult to control in the fMRI environment. A component
   of the latter is related to the odorant delivery human-machine
   interface, namely the point where odorants exit the dispensing apparatus
   to reach at the nose. Previous approaches relied on either nasal
   cannulas or nasal masks, each associated with particular drawbacks and
   discomforts. Here, we provide detailed descriptions and instructions for
   transforming the MRI head-coil into an olfactory microenvironment, or
   odor canopy, where odorants can be switched on and off in less than 150
   ms without cannula or mask. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we
   demonstrate that odor canopy provides for clearly dissociable odorant
   presence and absence, with no nonolfactory cues. Moreover, we find that
   odor canopy is rated more comfortable than nasal mask, and we
   demonstrate that using odor canopy in the fMRI generates a typical
   olfactory brain response. We conclude in recommending this approach for
   minimized discomfort in fMRI of olfaction.},

Title = {Assumptions beyond the science: encouraging cautious conclusions about
   functional magnetic resonance imaging research on organizational

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is likely to become the
   major tool for studying the neural underpinnings of organizational
   behavior. It is a technique for brain imaging that, according to
   advocates, provides information about which areas of the brain are
   activated during organizational processes (e.g., leadership and
   decision-making). In this article, we take a critical look at this tool
   from a technical perspective. In particular, we take the reader through
   the assumptions that must be made at the three main steps of the
   research process (study design, data capture, and interpretation of
   results) in order to draw conclusions about organizational phenomena
   from fMRI research. Applying this analysis to three case studies
   demonstrates the gap between what fMRI can actually tell us and the
   claims often made about the contribution of fMRI to understanding and
   improving organizational behavior. Our discussion provides researchers
   with a series of recommendations oriented toward optimizing the use of
   fMRI to help it live up to its potential in the field of organizational
   behavior and consumers with a means of evaluating fMRI research in order
   to draw appropriate and warranted conclusions. Copyright (c) 2016 John

Title = {Semantic unification modulates N400 and BOLD signal change in the brain:
   A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Semantic unification during sentence comprehension has been associated
   with amplitude change of the N400 in event-related potential (ERP)
   studies, and activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. However, the
   specificity of this activation to semantic unification remains unknown.
   To more closely examine the brain processes involved in semantic
   unification, we employed simultaneous EEG-fMRI to time-lock the semantic
   unification related N400 change, and integrated trial-by-trial variation
   in both N400 and BOLD change beyond the condition-level BOLD change
   difference measured in traditional fMRI analyses. Participants read
   sentences in which semantic unification load was parametrically
   manipulated by varying doze probability. Separately, ERP and fMRI
   results replicated previous findings, in that semantic unification load
   parametrically modulated the amplitude of N400 and cortical activation.
   Integrated EEG-fMRI analyses revealed a different pattern in which
   functional activity in the left IFG and bilateral supramarginal gyrus
   (SMG) was associated with N400 amplitude, with the left IFG activation
   and bilateral SMG activation being selective to the condition level and
   trial-level of semantic unification load, respectively. By employing the
   EEG-fMRI integrated analyses, this study among the first sheds light on
   how to integrate trial-level variation in language comprehension.},

Abstract = {Technologies for scalable analysis of very large datasets have emerged
   in the domain of internet computing, but are still rarely used in
   neuroimaging despite the existence of data and research questions in
   need of efficient computation tools especially in fMRI. In this work, we
   present software tools for the application of Apache Spark and Graphics
   Processing Units (GPUs) to neuroimaging datasets, in particular
   providing distributed file input for 4D NIfTI fMRI datasets in Scala for
   use in an Apache Spark environment. Examples for using this Big Data
   platform in graph analysis of fMRI datasets are shown to illustrate how
   processing pipelines employing it can be developed. With more tools for
   the convenient integration of neuroimaging file formats and typical
   processing steps, big data technologies could find wider endorsement in
   the community, leading to a range of potentially useful applications
   especially in view of the current collaborative creation of a wealth of
   large data repositories including thousands of individual fMRI datasets.},

Title = {Simultaneous real-time EEG-fMRI neurofeedback: A systematic review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Neurofeedback (NF) is a biofeedback technique that teaches individuals
   self-control of brain functions by measuring brain activations and
   providing an online feedback signal to modify emotional, cognitive, and
   behavioral functions. NF approaches typically rely on a single modality,
   such as electroencephalography (EEG-NF) or a brain imaging technique,
   such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-NF). The
   introduction of simultaneous EEG-fMRI tools has opened up the
   possibility of combining the high temporal resolution of EEG with the
   high spatial resolution of fMRI, thereby increasing the accuracy of NF.
   However, only a few studies have actively combined both techniques. In
   this study, we conducted a systematic review of EEG-fMRI-NF studies (N =
   17) to identify the potential and effectiveness of this non-invasive
   treatment for neurological conditions. The systematic review revealed a
   lack of homogeneity among the studies, including sample sizes,
   acquisition methods in terms of simultaneity of the two procedures
   (unimodal EEG-NF and fMRI-NF), therapeutic targets field, and the number
   of sessions. Indeed, because most studies are based on a single session
   of NF, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the therapeutic
   efficacy of NF. Therefore, further research is needed to fully
   understand non-clinical and clinical potential of EEG-fMRI-NF.},

Abstract = {The functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) monitored
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) patients has been found weaker than that in healthy participants.
   Since breathing and heart beating can cause fluctuations in the fMRI
   signal, these physiological activities may affect the fMRI data
   differently between AD patients and healthy participants. We collected
   resting-state fMRI data from AD patients and age-matched healthy
   participants. With concurrent cardiac and respiratory recordings, we
   estimated both physiological responses phase-locked and non-phase-locked
   to heart beating and breathing. We found that the cardiac and
   respiratory physiological responses in AD patients were 3.00 +/- 0.51 s
   and 3.96 +/- 0.52 s later (both p < 0.0001) than those in healthy
   participants, respectively. After correcting the physiological noise in
   the resting-state fMRI data by population-specific physiological
   response functions, the DMN estimated by seed-correlation was more
   localized to the seed region. The DMN difference between AD patients and
   healthy controls became insignificant after suppressing physiological
   noise. Our results indicate the importance of controlling physiological
   noise in the resting-state fMRI analysis to obtain clinically related
   characterizations in AD.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive technique
   that facilitates the study of brain activity by measuring changes in
   blood flow. Brain activity signals can be recorded during the alternate
   performance of given tasks, that is, task fMRI (tfMRI), or during
   resting-state, that is, resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), as a measure of
   baseline brain activity. This contributes to the understanding of how
   the human brain is organized in functionally distinct subdivisions. fMRI
   experiments from high-resolution scans provide hundred of thousands of
   longitudinal signals for each individual, corresponding to brain
   activity measurements over each voxel of the brain along the duration of
   the experiment. In this context, we propose novel visualization
   techniques for high-dimensional functional data relying on depth-based
   notions that enable computationally efficient 2-dim representations of
   fMRI data, which elucidate sample composition, outlier presence, and
   individual variability. We believe that this previous step is crucial to
   any inferential approach willing to identify neuroscientific patterns
   across individuals, tasks, and brain regions. We present the proposed
   technique via an extensive simulation study, and demonstrate its
   application on a motor and language tfMRI experiment.},

Title = {Vascular origins of low-frequency oscillations in the cerebrospinal

Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},

Abstract = {In vivo mapping of cerebrovascular oscillations in the 0.05-0.15 Hz
   remains difficult. Oscillations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   represent a possible avenue for noninvasively tracking these
   oscillations using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and have been
   used to correct for vascular oscillations in rs-fMRI functional
   connectivity. However, the relationship between low-frequency CSF and
   vascular oscillations remains unclear. In this study, we investigate
   this relationship using fast simultaneous rs-fMRI and photoplethysmogram
   (PPG), examining the 0.1 Hz PPG signal, heart-rate variability (HRV),
   pulse-intensity ratio (PIR), and the second derivative of the PPG
   (SDPPG). The main findings of this study are: (a) signals in different
   CSF regions are not equivalent in their associations with vascular and
   tissue rs-fMRI signals; (b) the PPG signal is maximally coherent with
   the arterial and CSF signals at the cardiac frequency, but coherent with
   brain tissue at similar to 0.2 Hz; (c) PIR is maximally coherent with
   the CSF signal near 0.03 Hz; and (d) PPG-related vascular oscillations
   only contribute to es similar to 15\% of the CSF (and arterial) signal
   in rs-fMRI. These findings caution against averaging all CSF regions
   when extracting physiological nuisance regressors in rs-fMRI
   applications, and indicate the drivers of the CSF signal are more than
   simply cardiac. Our study is an initial attempt at the refinement and
   standardization of how the CSF signal in rs-fMRI can be used and
   interpreted. It also paves the way for using rs-fMRI in the CSF as a
   potential tool for tracking cerebrovascular health through, for
   instance, the potential relationship between PIR and the CSF signal.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},

Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Data processing toolboxes for resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)
   have provided us with a variety of functions and user friendly graphic
   user interfaces (GUIs). However, many toolboxes only cover a certain
   range of functions, and use exclusively designed GUIs. To facilitate
   data processing and alleviate the burden of manually drawing GUIs, we
   have developed a versatile and extendable MATLAB-based toolbox, BRANT
   (BRAinNetome fmri Toolkit), with a wide range of rs-fMRI data processing
   functions and code-generated GUIs. During the implementation, we have
   also empowered the toolbox with parallel computing techniques, efficient
   file handling methods for compressed file format, and one-line
   scripting. In BRANT, users can find rs-fMRI batch processing functions
   for preprocessing, brain spontaneous activity analysis, functional
   connectivity analysis, complex network analysis, statistical analysis,
   and results visualization, while developers can quickly publish scripts
   with code-generated GUIs.},

Title = {Foundations of layer-specific fMRI and investigations of
   neurophysiological activity in the laminarized neocortex and olfactory

Abstract = {Laminar organization of neuronal circuits is a recurring feature of how
   the brain processes information. For instance, different layers
   compartmentalize different cell types, synaptic activities, and have
   unique intrinsic and extrinsic connections that serve as units for
   specialized signal processing. Functional MRI is an invaluable tool to
   investigate laminar processing in the in vivo human brain, but it
   measures neuronal activity indirectly by way of the hemodynamic
   response. Therefore, the accuracy of high-resolution laminar fMRI
   depends on how precisely it can measure localized microvascular changes
   nearest to the site of evoked activity. To determine the specificity of
   fMRI responses to the true neurophysiological responses across layers,
   the flexibility to invasive procedures in animal models has been
   necessary. In this review, we will examine different fMRI contrasts and
   their appropriate uses for layer-specific fMRI, and how localized
   laminar processing was examined in the neocortex and olfactory bulb.
   Through collective efforts, it was determined that microvessels,
   including capillaries, are regulated within single layers and that
   several endogenous and contrast-enhanced fMRI contrast mechanisms can
   separate these neural-specific vascular changes from the nonspecific,
   especially cerebral blood volume-weighted fMRI with intravenous contrast
   agent injection. We will also propose some open questions that are
   relevant for the successful implementation of layer-specific fMRI and
   its potential future directions to study laminar processing when
   combined with optogenetics.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized
   cognitive neuroscience, but methodological barriers limit the
   generalizability of findings from the lab to the real world. Here, we
   present Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic
   fMRI data designed to facilitate the adoption of robust and
   generalizable research practices. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art
   machine learning models to automatically annotate stimuli from dozens of
   fMRI studies using naturalistic stimuli-such as movies and
   narratives-allowing researchers to easily test neuroscientific
   hypotheses across multiple ecologically-valid datasets. In addition,
   Neuroscout builds on a robust ecosystem of open tools and standards to
   provide an easy-to-use analysis builder and a fully automated execution
   engine that reduce the burden of reproducible research. Through a series
   of meta-analytic case studies, we validate the automatic feature
   extraction approach and demonstrate its potential to support more robust
   fMRI research. Owing to its ease of use and a high degree of automation,
   Neuroscout makes it possible to overcome modeling challenges commonly
   arising in naturalistic analysis and to easily scale analyses within and
   across datasets, democratizing generalizable fMRI research.},

Title = {When Is Simultaneous Recording Necessary? A Guide for Researchers
   Considering Combined EEG-fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) provide non-invasive measures of brain activity at varying
   spatial and temporal scales, offering different views on brain function
   for both clinical and experimental applications. Simultaneous recording
   of these measures attempts to maximize the respective strengths of each
   method, while compensating for their weaknesses. However, combined
   recording is not necessary to address all research questions of
   interest, and experiments may have greater statistical power to detect
   effects by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in separate recording
   sessions. While several existing papers discuss the reasons for or
   against combined recording, this article aims to synthesize these
   arguments into a flow chart of questions that researchers can consider
   when deciding whether to record EEG and fMRI separately or
   simultaneously. Given the potential advantages of simultaneous EEG-fMRI,
   the aim is to provide an initial overview of the most important concepts
   and to direct readers to relevant literature that will aid them in this
   decision.},

Title = {EEG and fMRI agree: Mental arithmetic is the easiest form of imagery to
   detect},
Journal = {CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {104-116},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {fMRI and EEG during mental imagery provide alternative methods of
   detecting awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC)
   without reliance on behaviour. Because using fMRI in patients with DOC
   is difficult, studies increasingly employ EEG. However, there has been
   no verification that these modalities provide converging information at
   the individual subject level. The present study examined simultaneous
   EEG and fMRI in healthy volunteers during six mental imagery tasks to
   determine whether one mental imagery task generates more robust
   activation across subjects; whether activation can be predicted from
   familiarity with the imagined activity; and whether EEG and fMRI
   converge upon the same conclusions about individual imagery performance.
   Mental arithmetic generated the most robust activation in the majority
   of subjects for both EEG and fMRI, and level of activation could not be
   predicted from familiarity, with either modality. We conclude that
   overall, EEG and fMRI agree regarding individual mental imagery
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Characteristics of fMRI responses to visual stimulation in anesthetized
   vs. awake mice},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {226},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The functional characteristics of the mouse visual system have not
   previously been well explored using fMRI. In this research, we examined
   9.4 T BOLD fMRI responses to visual stimuli of varying pulse durations
   (1 - 50 ms) and temporal frequencies (1 - 10 Hz) under ketamine and
   xylazine anesthesia, and compared fMRI responses of anesthetized and
   awake mice. Under anesthesia, significant positive BOLD responses were
   detected bilaterally in the major structures of the visual pathways,
   including the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, superior colliculus,
   lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus, primary visual area, and
   higher-order visual area. BOLD responses increased slightly with pulse
   duration, were maximal at 3 - 5 Hz stimulation, and significantly
   decreased at 10 Hz, which were all consistent with previous
   neurophysiological findings. When the mice were awake, the BOLD fMRI
   response was faster in all active regions and stronger in the
   subcortical areas compared with the anesthesia condition. In the V1, the
   BOLD response was biphasic for 5 Hz stimulation and negative for 10 Hz
   stimulation under wakefulness, whereas prolonged positive BOLD responses
   were observed at both frequencies under anesthesia. Unexpected
   activation was detected in the extrastriate postrhinal area and
   non-visual subiculum complex under anesthesia, but not under
   wakefulness. Widespread positive BOLD activity under anesthesia likely
   results from the disinhibition and sensitization of excitatory neurons
   induced by ketamine. Overall, fMRI can be a viable tool for mapping
   brain-wide functional networks.},

Title = {A clinically applicable functional MRI memory paradigm for use with
   pediatric patients},
Journal = {EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Clinically employable functional MRI (fMRI) memory paradigms
   are not yet established for pediatric patient epilepsy surgery workups.
   Seeking to establish such a paradigm, we evaluated the effectiveness of
   memory fMRI tasks we developed by quantifying individual activation in a
   clinical pediatric setting, analyzing patterns of activation relative to
   the side of temporal lobe (TL) pathology, and comparing fMRI and Wada
   test results. Methods: We retrospectively identified 72 patients aged
   6.7-20.9 years with pathology (seizure focus and/or tumor) limited to
   the TL who had attempted memory and language fMRI tasks over a 9-year
   period as part of presurgical workups. Memory fMRI tasks required
   visualization of autobiographical memories in a block design alternating
   with covert counting. Language fMRI protocols involved verb and sentence
   generation. Scans were both qualitatively interpreted and quantitatively
   assessed for blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal change
   using region of interest (ROI) masks. We calculated the percentage of
   successfully scanned individual cases, compared 2 memory task activation
   masks in cases with left versus right TL pathology, and compared fMRI
   with Wada tests when available. Patients who had viable fMRI and Wada
   tests had generally concordant results. Results: Of the 72 cases, 60
   (83\%), aged 7.6-20.9 years, successfully performed the memory fMRI
   tasks and 12 (17\%) failed. Eleven of 12 unsuccessful scans were due to
   motion and/or inability to perform the tasks, and the success of a
   twelfth was indeterminate due to orthodontic metal artifact. Seven of
   the successful 60 cases had distorted anatomy that precluded employing
   predetermined masks for quantitative analysis. Successful fMRI memory
   studies showed bilateral mesial temporal activation and quantitatively
   demonstrated: (1) left activation (L-ACT) less than right activation
   (R-ACT) in cases with left temporal lobe (L-TL) pathology, (2)
   nonsignificant R-ACT less than L-ACT in cases with right temporal lobe
   (R-TL) pathology, and (3) lower L-ACT plus R-ACT activation for cases
   with L-TL versus R-TL pathology. Patients who had viable fMRI and Wada
   tests had generally concordant results. Significance: This study
   demonstrates evidence of an fMRI memory task paradigm that elicits
   reliable activation at the individual level and can generally be
   accomplished in clinically involved pediatric patients. This
   autobiographical memory paradigm showed activation in mesial TL
   structures, and cases with left compared to right TL pathology showed
   differences in activation consistent with extant literature in TL
   epilepsy. Further studies will be required to assess outcome prediction.

Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have become
   increasingly popular both with clinicians and researchers as they are
   capable of providing unique insights into brain functions. However,
   multiple technical considerations (ranging from specifics of paradigm
   design to imaging artifacts, complex protocol definition, and multitude
   of processing and methods of analysis, as well as intrinsic
   methodological limitations) must be considered and addressed in order to
   optimize fMRI analysis and to arrive at the most accurate and grounded
   interpretation of the data. In practice, the researcher/clinician must
   choose, from many available options, the most suitable software tool for
   each stage of the fMRI analysis pipeline. Herein we provide a
   straightforward guide designed to address, for each of the major stages,
   the techniques, and tools involved in the process. We have developed
   this guide both to help those new to the technique to overcome the most
   critical difficulties in its use, as well as to serve as a resource for
   the neuroimaging community.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {fMRI has been used as an outcome measure in dementia treatment studies,
   with many previous studies comparing only single pre- and post-treatment
   fMRI scans to determine treatment-induced neural changes, while
   utilizing single subject experimental designs. The purpose of the
   current study was to evaluate fMRI test-retest reliability in dementia
   patients and typical older adults using noun and verb confrontation
   naming to evaluate the validity of using a single pre/post-treatment
   scan comparison. Seven individuals with dementia and 9 control
   participants were tested three times over two months using the same fMRI
   procedures. Differences in individual and group level activation
   patterns were observed that varied across time. Additionally, the extent
   of variability fluctuated across individuals, groups, and the
   grammatical category of target words. Our findings suggested that one
   time fMRI scanning may inadequately represent an individual's typical
   brain activation pattern, particularly an individual with dementia.
   Thus, multiple imaging baselines are recommended.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been available
   commercially for clinical diagnostic use for many years. However, both
   clinical interpretation of fMRI by a neuroradiologist and quantitative
   analysis of fMRI data can require significant personnel resources that
   exceed reimbursement. In this report, a fully automated computer-based
   quantification methodology (Enumerated Auditory Response, EAR) has been
   developed to provide an auditory fMRI assessment of patients who have
   suffered a mild traumatic brain injury. Fifty-five study participants
   with interpretable auditory fMRI sequence data were assessed by EAR
   analysis, as well as both clinical radiologist fMRI interpretation and
   voxelwise general linear model (GLM) analysis. Comparison between the
   clinical interpretation and the two computer analysis methods resulted
   in 67\% concordance (identical), 32\% near-concordance (one level
   difference), and 1\% discordant. Comparison between the clinical
   computer-based quantification (EAR) and GLM analysis yielded significant
   correlations in right and left ear responses (p<0.05) for the full
   subject group. Automated fMRI quantification analysis equivalent to EAR
   might be appropriate for both future research projects with constrained
   resources, as well as possible routine clinical use.},

Pages = {2117-2123},
Abstract = {Many of the most debilitating symptoms for psychiatric disorders such as
   schizophrenia remain poorly treated. As such, the development of novel
   treatments is urgently needed. Unfortunately, the costs associated with
   high failure rates for investigational compounds as they enter clinical
   trials has led to pharmaceutical companies downsizing or eliminating
   research programs needed to develop these drugs. One way of increasing
   the probability of success for investigational compounds is to
   incorporate alternative methods of identifying biological targets in
   order to more effectively screen new drugs. A promising method of
   accomplishing this goal for psychiatric drugs is to use functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI investigates neural circuits,
   shedding light on the biology that generates symptoms such as
   hallucinations. Once identified, relevant neural circuits can be
   targeted with pharmacologic interventions and the response to these
   drugs measured with fMRI. This review describes the early use of fMRI in
   this context, and discusses the alpha7 nicotinic receptor agonist
   3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene) anabaseine (DMXB-A), as an example of the
   potential value of fMRI for psychiatric drug development.},

Abstract = {Task fMRI provides an opportunity to analyze the working mechanisms of
   the human brain during specific experimental paradigms. Deep learning
   models have increasingly been applied for decoding and encoding purposes
   study to representations in task fMRI data. More recently, graph neural
   networks, or neural networks models designed to leverage the properties
   of graph representations, have recently shown promise in task fMRI
   decoding studies. Here, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional
   network (GCN) framework with three convolutional layers to classify task
   fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project dataset. We compared the
   predictive performance of our GCN model across four of the most widely
   used node embedding algorithms-NetMF, RandNE, Node2Vec, and Walklets-to
   automatically extract the structural properties of the nodes in the
   functional graph. The empirical results indicated that our GCN framework
   accurately predicted individual differences (0.978 and 0.976) with the
   NetMF and RandNE embedding methods, respectively. Furthermore, to assess
   the effects of individual differences, we tested the classification
   performance of the model on sub-datasets divided according to gender and
   fluid intelligence. Experimental results indicated significant
   differences in the classification predictions of gender, but not
   high/low fluid intelligence fMRI data. Our experiments yielded promising
   results and demonstrated the superior ability of our GCN in modeling
   task fMRI data.},

Title = {Advancing brain network models to reconcile functional neuroimaging and
   clinical research},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures information on
   brain function beyond the anatomical alterations that are traditionally
   visually examined by neuroradiologists. However, the fMRI signals are
   complex in addition to being noisy, so fMRI still faces limitations for
   clinical applications. Here we review methods that have been proposed as
   potential solutions so far, namely statistical, biophysical and decoding
   models, with their strengths and weaknesses. We especially evaluate the
   ability of these models to directly predict clinical variables from
   their parameters (predictability) and to extract clinically relevant
   information regarding biological mechanisms and relevant features for
   classification and prediction (interpretability). We then provide
   guidelines for useful applications and pitfalls of such fMRI-based
   models in a clinical research context, looking beyond the current state
   of the art. In particular, we argue that the clinical relevance of fMRI
   calls for a new generation of models for fMRI data, which combine the
   strengths of both biophysical and decoding models. This leads to
   reliable and biologically meaningful model parameters, which thus
   fulfills the need for simultaneous inter-pretability and predictability.
   In our view, this synergy is fundamental for the discovery of new
   pharmacological and interventional targets, as well as the use of models
   as biomarkers in neurology and psychiatry.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an established eloquent
   cortex mapping technique that is now an integral part of the
   pre-operative work-up in candidates for epilepsy surgery. Emerging
   evidence in adults with epilepsy suggests that material-specific fMRI
   paradigms can predict postoperative memory outcomes, however these
   paradigms are not suitable for children. In pediatric age, the use of
   memory fMRI paradigms designed for adults is complicated by the effect
   of developmental stages in cognitive maturation, the impairment
   experienced by some people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the
   normal representation of memory function during development, which may
   differ from adults. We present a memory fMRI paradigm designed to
   activate mesial temporal lobe structures that is brief, independent of
   reading ability, and therefore a novel candidate for use in children.
   Data from 33 adults and 19 children (all healthy controls) show that the
   paradigm captures the expected leftward asymmetry of mesial temporal
   activation in adults. A more symmetrical pattern was observed in
   children, consistent with the progressive emergence of hemispheric
   specialisation across childhood. These data have important implications
   for the interpretation of presurgical memory fMRI in the pediatric
   setting. They also highlight the need to carefully consider the impact
   of cognitive development on fMRI tools used in clinical practice.},

Title = {Analyzing 20 years of Resting-State fMRI Research: Trends and
   collaborative networks revealed},
Journal = {BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {1822},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), initially
   proposed by Biswal et al. in 1995, has emerged as a pivotal facet of
   neuroimaging research. Its ability to examine brain activity during the
   resting state without the need for explicit tasks or stimuli has made it
   an integral component of brain imaging studies. In recent years, rs-fMRI
   has witnessed substantial growth and found widespread application in the
   investigation of functional connectivity within the brain. To delineate
   the developmental trajectory of rs-fMRI over the past two decades, we
   conducted a comprehensive analysis using bibliometric tool Citespace.
   Our analysis encompassed publication trends, authorship networks,
   institutional affiliations, international collaborations, as well as
   emergent themes in references and keywords. Our study reveals a
   remarkable increase in the volume of rs-fMRI publications over the past
   two decades, underscoring the burgeoning interest and potential within
   this field. Harvard University stands out as the institution with the
   highest number of research papers published in the realm of RS-fMRI,
   while the United States holds the highest overall influence in this
   domain. The recent emergence of keywords such as ``machine learning{''}
   and ``default mode,{''} coupled with citation surges in reference to
   rs-fMRI, have paved new avenues for research within this field. Our
   study underscores the critical importance of integrating machine
   learning techniques into rs-fMRI investigations, offering valuable
   insights into brain function and disease diagnosis. These findings hold
   profound significance for the field of neuroscience and may furnish
   insights for future research employing rs-fMRI as a diagnostic tool for
   a wide array of neurological disorders, thus emphasizing its pivotal
   role and potential as a tool for investigating brain functionality.},

Title = {Neuroaging through the Lens of the Resting State Networks},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) allows
   studying spontaneous brain activity in absence of task, recording
   changes of Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. rs-fMRI
   enables identification of brain networks also called Resting State
   Networks (RSNs) including the most studied Default Mode Network (DMN).
   The simplicity and speed of executionmake rs-fMRI applicable in a
   variety of normal and pathological conditions. Since it does not require
   any task, rs-fMRI is particularly useful for protocols on patients,
   children, and elders, increasing participant's compliance and reducing
   intersubjective variability due to the task performance. rs-fMRI has
   shown high sensitivity in identification of RSNs modifications in
   several diseases also in absence of structural modifications. In this
   narrative review, we provide the state of the art of rs-fMRI studies
   about physiological and pathological aging processes. First, we
   introduce the background of resting state; then we review clinical
   findings provided by rs-fMRI in physiological aging, Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer Dementia (AD), and Late Life Depression
   (LLD). Finally, we suggest future directions in this field of research
   and its potential clinical applications.},

Title = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Diffusion Tensor
   Imaging-Tractography in Resective Brain Surgery: Lesion Coverage
   Strategies and Patient Outcomes},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-tractography and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) have dynamically entered the presurgical
   evaluation context of brain surgery during the past decades, providing
   novel perspectives in surgical planning and lesion access approaches.
   However, their application in the presurgical setting requires
   significant time and effort and increased costs, thereby raising
   questions regarding efficiency and best use. In this work, we set out to
   evaluate DTI-tractography and combined fMRI/DTI-tractography during
   intra-operative neuronavigation in resective brain surgery using
   lesion-related preoperative neurological deficit (PND) outcomes as
   metrics. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 252 consecutive
   patients admitted for brain surgery. Standard anatomical neuroimaging
   protocols were performed in 127 patients, 69 patients had additional
   DTI-tractography, and 56 had combined DTI-tractography/fMRI. fMRI
   procedures involved language, motor, somatic sensory, sensorimotor and
   visual mapping. DTI-tractography involved fiber tracking of the motor,
   sensory, language and visual pathways. At 1 month postoperatively,
   DTI-tractography patients were more likely to present either improvement
   or preservation of PNDs (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively). At 6
   months, combined DTI-tractography/fMRI patients were more likely to
   experience complete PND resolution (p < 0.001). Low-grade lesion
   patients (N = 102) with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI were more likely
   to experience complete resolution of PNDs at 1 and 6 months (p = 0.001
   and p < 0.001, respectively). High-grade lesion patients (N = 140) with
   combined DTI-tractography/fMRI were more likely to have PNDs resolved at
   6 months (p = 0.005). Patients with motor symptoms (N = 80) were more
   likely to experience complete remission of PNDs at 6 months with
   DTI-tractography or combined DTI-tractography/fMRI (p = 0.008 and p =
   0.004, respectively), without significant difference between the two
   imaging protocols (p = 1). Patients with sensory symptoms (N = 44) were
   more likely to experience complete PND remission at 6 months with
   combined DTI-tractography/fMRI (p = 0.004). The intraoperative
   neuroimaging modality did not have a significant effect in patients with
   preoperative seizures (N = 47). Lack of PND worsening was observed at 6
   month follow-up in patients with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI. Our
   results strongly support the combined use of DTI-tractography and fMRI
   in patients undergoing resective brain surgery for improving their
   postoperative clinical profile.},

Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic images (rs-fMRIs) can be used to map
   and delineate the brain activity occurring while the patient is in a
   task-free state. These resting-state activity networks can be
   informative when diagnosing various neurodevelopmental diseases, but
   only if the images are high quality. The quality of an rs-fMRI rapidly
   degrades when the patient moves during the scan. Herein, we describe how
   patient motion impacts an rs-fMRI on multiple levels. We begin with how
   the electromagnetic field and pulses of an MR scanner interact with a
   patient's physiology, how movement affects the net signal acquired by
   the scanner, and how motion can be quantified from rs-fMRI. We then
   present methods for preventing motion through educational and behavioral
   interventions appropriate for different age groups, techniques for
   prospectively monitoring and correcting motion during the acquisition
   process, and pipelines for mitigating the effects of motion in existing
   scans.},

Title = {A Guide to Literature Informed Decisions in the Design of Real Time fMRI
   Neurofeedback Studies: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Background: Although biofeedback using electrophysiology has been
   explored extensively, the approach of using neurofeedback corresponding
   to hemodynamic response is a relatively young field. Real time
   functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF)
   uses sensory feedback to operantly reinforce patterns of neural
   response. It can be used, for example, to alter visual perception,
   increase brain connectivity, and reduce depression symptoms. Within
   recent years, interest in rt-fMRI-NF in both research and clinical
   contexts has expanded considerably. As such, building a consensus
   regarding best practices is of great value.
   Objective: This systematic review is designed to describe and evaluate
   the variations in methodology used in previous rt-fMRI-NF studies to
   provide recommendations for rt-fMRI-NF study designs that are mostly
   likely to elicit reproducible and consistent effects of neurofeedback.
   Methods: We conducted a database search for fMRI neurofeedback papers
   published prior to September 26th, 2019. Of 558 studies identified, 146
   met criteria for inclusion. The following information was collected from
   each study: sample size and type, task used, neurofeedback calculation,
   regulation procedure, feedback, whether feedback was explicitly related
   to changing brain activity, feedback timing, control group for active
   neurofeedback, how many runs and sessions of neurofeedback, if a
   follow-up was conducted, and the results of neurofeedback training.
   Results: rt-fMRI-NF is typically upregulation practice based on
   hemodynamic response from a specific region of the brain presented using
   a continually updating thermometer display. Most rt-fMRI-NF studies are
   conducted in healthy samples and half evaluate its effect on immediate
   changes in behavior or affect. The most popular control group method is
   to provide sham signal from another region; however, many studies do not
   compare use a comparison group.
   Conclusions: We make several suggestions for designs of future
   rt-fMRI-NF studies. Researchers should use feedback calculation methods
   that consider neural response across regions (i.e., SVM or
   connectivity), which should be conveyed as intermittent, auditory
   feedback. Participants should be given explicit instructions and should
   be assessed on individual differences. Future rt-fMRI-NF studies should
   use clinical samples; effectiveness of rt-fMRI-NF should be evaluated on
   clinical/behavioral outcomes at follow-up time points in comparison to
   both a sham and no feedback control group.},

Abstract = {Neuroimaging-based prediction methods for intelligence have seen a rapid
   development. Among different neuroimaging modalities, prediction using
   functional connectivity (FC) has shown great promise. Most literature
   has focused on prediction using static FC, with limited investigations
   on the merits of such analysis compared to prediction using dynamic FC
   or region-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) times
   series that encode temporal variability. To account for the temporal
   dynamics in fMRI, we propose a bi-directional long short-term memory
   (bi-LSTM) approach that incorporates feature selection mechanism. The
   proposed pipeline is implemented via an efficient algorithm and applied
   for predicting intelligence using region-level time series and dynamic
   FC. We compare the prediction performance using different fMRI features
   acquired from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study
   involving nearly 7000 individuals. Our detailed analysis illustrates the
   consistently inferior performance of static FC compared to region-level
   time series or dynamic FC for single and combined rest and task fMRI
   experiments. The joint analysis of task and rest fMRI leads to improved
   intelligence prediction under all models compared to using fMRI from
   only one experiment. In addition, the proposed bi-LSTM pipeline based on
   region-level time series identifies several shared and differential
   important brain regions across fMRI experiments that drive intelligence
   prediction. A test-retest analysis of the selected regions shows strong
   reliability across cross-validation folds. Given the large sample size
   of ABCD study, our results provide strong evidence that superior
   prediction of intelligence can be achieved by accounting for temporal
   variations in fMRI.},

Title = {Ultrafast fMRI of the rodent brain using simultaneous multi-slice EPI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {48-58},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of functional MRI (fMRI)
   measurement has been shown to benefit the study of neural dynamics and
   functional interaction. However, acceleration of rodent brain fMRI using
   parallel and simultaneous multi-slice imaging techniques is hampered by
   the lack of high-density phased-array coils for the small brain. To
   overcome this limitation, we adapted phase-offset multiplanar and
   blipped-controlled aliasing echo planar imaging (EPI) to enable
   simultaneous multi-slice fMRI of the mouse brain using a single loop
   coil on a 9.4T scanner. Four slice bands of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.5 mm(3)
   resolution can be simultaneously acquired to cover the whole brain at a
   temporal resolution of 300 ms or the whole cerebrum in 150 ms. Instead
   of losing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), both spatial and temporal SNR can
   be increased due to the increased k-space sampling compared to a
   standard single-band EPI. Task fMRI using a visual stimulation shows
   close to 80\% increase of z-score and 4 times increase of activated area
   in the visual cortex using the multiband EPI due to the highly increased
   temporal samples. Resting-state fMRI shows reliable detection of
   bilateral connectivity by both single-band and multiband EPI, but no
   significant difference was found. Without the need of a dedicated
   hardware, we have demonstrated a practical method that can enable
   unparallelly fast whole-brain fMRI for preclinical studies. This
   technique can be used to increase sensitivity, distinguish transient
   response or acquire high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formal studies that validated functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) against direct cortical stimulation (DCS) have shown
   inconsistencies.
   METHODS: We reviewed the reported data and performed a meta-analysis of
   studies that had validated fMRI using DCS and the Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We performed
   the meta-analysis of the studies that had met our inclusion criteria.
   The positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values
   (NPVs), false omission rates (FORs), false discovery rates (FDRs),
   sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. We also identified the
   factors that could influence the fMRI findings.
   RESULTS: Six studies of language activation and two of motor activation
   were eligible for the present meta-analysis. The PPV of fMRI for the
   detection of eloquent motor cortex was 59.5\%, and the FDR was 40.5\%.
   The NPV was 96\% and the FOR was 3.9\%. The sensitivity and specificity
   of fMRI for the detection of the eloquent motor cortex was 91\% and
   76\%, respectively. For language activation, the PPV was 71.7\%, the NPV
   was 80\%, the FDR was 28.2\%, and the FOR was 19.5\%. The sensitivity
   and specificity was 80\% and 71.5\%, respectively. The factors that
   could have caused a mismatch or affected the reliability were analyzed.
   CONCLUSION: The results from the present analysis of the available
   reported evidence suggest that fMRI itself (due to neurovascular
   uncoupling) or analysis of the findings have limitations regarding
   reliability when validated against DCS. From the existing studies, our
   results indicate that using fMRI alone for surgical planning could lead
   to undesirable outcomes.},

Title = {Hypercapnic evaluation of vascular reactivity in healthy aging and acute
   stroke via functional MRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {173-179},
Abstract = {FunctionalMRI (fMRI) iswell-established for the study of brain function
   in healthy populations, although its clinical application has proven
   more challenging. Specifically, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which
   allows the assessment of the vascular response that serves as the basis
   for fMRI, has been shown to be reduced in healthy aging aswell as in a
   range of diseases, including chronic stroke. However, the timing ofwhen
   this occurs relative to the stroke event is unclear. We used a
   breath-hold fMRI task to evaluate CVR across gray matter in a group of
   acute stroke patients (<10 days from stroke; N = 22) to address this
   question. These estimates were compared with those from both age-matched
   (N = 22) and younger (N = 22) healthy controls. As expected, young
   controls had the greatest mean CVR, as indicated by magnitude and extent
   of fMRI activation; however, stroke patients did not differ
   fromage-matched controls. Moreover, the ipsilesional and contralesional
   hemispheres of stroke patients did not differ with respect to any of
   these measures. These findings suggest that fMRI remains a valid tool
   within the first few days of a stroke, particularly for group fMRI
   studies in which findings are compared with healthy subjects of similar
   age. However, given the relatively high variability in CVR observed in
   our stroke sample, caution is warranted when interpreting fMRI data from
   individual patients or a small cohort. We conclude that a breath-hold
   task can be a useful addition to functional imaging protocols for stroke
   patients. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Abstract = {As the size of brain imaging data such as fMRI grows explosively, it
   provides us with unprecedented and abundant information about the brain.
   How to reduce the size of fMRI data but not lose much information
   becomes a more and more pressing issue. Recent literature studies tried
   to deal with it by dictionary learning and sparse representation
   methods, however, their computation complexities are still high, which
   hampers the wider application of sparse representation method to large
   scale fMRI datasets. To effectively address this problem, this work
   proposes to represent resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals of a whole
   brain via a statistical sampling based sparse representation. First we
   sampled the whole brain's signals via different sampling methods, then
   the sampled signals were aggregate into an input data matrix to learn a
   dictionary, finally this dictionary was used to sparsely represent the
   whole brain's signals and identify the resting state networks.
   Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed signal sampling
   framework can speed-up by ten times in reconstructing concurrent brain
   networks without losing much information. The experiments on the 1000
   Functional Connectomes Project further demonstrate its effectiveness and

Abstract = {Spontaneous activity observed with resting-state fMRI is used widely to
   uncover the brain's intrinsic functional networks in health and disease.
   Although many networks appear modular and specific, global and
   nonspecific fMRI fluctuations also exist and both pose a challenge and
   present an opportunity for characterizing and understanding brain
   networks. Here, we used a multimodal approach to investigate the neural
   correlates to the global fMRI signal in the resting state. Like fMRI,
   resting-state power fluctuations of broadband and arrhythmic, or
   scale-free, macaque electrocorticography and human
   magnetoencephalography activity were correlated globally. The power
   fluctuations of scale-free human electroencephalography (EEG) were
   coupled with the global component of simultaneously acquired
   resting-state fMRI, with the global hemodynamic change lagging the
   broadband spectral change of EEG by similar to 5 s. The levels of global
   and nonspecific fluctuation and synchronization in scale-free population
   activity also varied across and depended on arousal states. Together,
   these results suggest that the neural origin of global resting-state
   fMRI activity is the broadband power fluctuation in scale-free
   population activity observable with macroscopic electrical or magnetic
   recordings. Moreover, the global fluctuation in neurophysiological and
   hemodynamic activity is likely modulated through diffuse neuromodulation
   pathways that govern arousal states and vigilance levels.},

Title = {RP-Rs-fMRIomics as a Novel Imaging Analysis Strategy to Empower
   Diagnosis of Brain Gliomas},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI), a popular neuroimaging technique, can provide rich
   information about functional processes in the brain with a large array
   of imaging parameters and is suitable for exploring the
   pathophysiological essence of gliomas. In this study, by applying omics
   analysis strategy to rs-fMRI with exhaustive regional parameters, we
   proposed a novel approach, named Regional Parameter of Resting-state
   fMRI-omics (RP-Rs-fMRIomics), and further evaluated the diagnosis
   performance of the method on brain gliomas. We found that the
   RP-Rs-fMRIomics, featuring entire investigation and high
   interpretability, presented superior performance in prediction of tumor
   grade, IDH genotype and prognosis of brain gliomas. This RP-Rs-fMRIomics
   not only contributed a new imaging method for brain glioma research, but
   also expanded the clinical application of rs-fMRI. Rs-fMRI can provide
   rich information about functional processes in the brain with a large
   array of imaging parameters and is also suitable for investigating the
   biological processes in cerebral gliomas. We aimed to propose an imaging
   analysis method of RP-Rs-fMRIomics by adopting omics analysis on rs-fMRI
   with exhaustive regional parameters and subsequently estimating its
   feasibility on the prediction diagnosis of gliomas. In this
   retrospective study, preoperative rs-fMRI data were acquired from
   patients confirmed with diffuse gliomas (n = 176). A total of 420
   features were extracted through measuring 14 regional parameters of
   rs-fMRI as much as available currently in 10 specific narrow frequency
   bins and three parts of gliomas. With a randomly split training and
   testing dataset (ratio 7:3), four classifiers were implemented to
   construct and optimize RP-Rs-fMRIomics models for predicting glioma
   grade, IDH status and Karnofsky Performance Status scores. The
   RP-Rs-fMRIomics models (AUROC 0.988, 0.905, 0.801) were superior to the
   corresponding traditional single rs-fMRI index (AUROC 0.803, 0.731,
   0.632) in predicting glioma grade, IDH and survival. The RP-Rs-fMRIomics
   analysis, featuring high interpretability, was competitive for
   prediction of glioma grading, IDH genotype and prognosis. The method
   expanded the clinical application of rs-fMRI and also contributed a new
   imaging analysis for brain tumor research.},

Title = {Accurate autocorrelation modeling substantially improves fMRI
   reliability},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Given the recent controversies in some neuroimaging statistical methods,
   we compare the most frequently used functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) analysis packages: AFNI, FSL and SPM, with regard to
   temporal autocorrelation modeling. This process, sometimes known as
   pre-whitening, is conducted in virtually all task fMRI studies. Here, we
   employ eleven datasets containing 980 scans corresponding to different
   fMRI protocols and subject populations. We found that autocorrelation
   modeling in AFNI, although imperfect, performed much better than the
   autocorrelation modeling of FSL and SPM. The presence of residual
   autocorrelated noise in FSL and SPM leads to heavily confounded first
   level results, particularly for low-frequency experimental designs.
   SPM's alternative pre-whitening method, FAST, performed better than
   SPM's default. The reliability of task fMRI studies could be improved
   with more accurate autocorrelation modeling. We recommend that fMRI
   analysis packages provide diagnostic plots to make users aware of any
   pre-whitening problems.},

Abstract = {Studies comparing diverse groups have shown that many psychiatric
   diseases involve disruptions across distributed large-scale networks of
   the brain. There is hope that functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) functional connectivity techniques will shed light on these
   disruptions, providing prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers as well as
   targets for therapeutic interventions. However, to date, progress on
   clinical translation of fMRI methods has been limited. Here, we argue
   that this limited translation is driven by a combination of intersubject
   heterogeneity and the relatively low reliability of standard fMRI
   techniques at the individual level. We review a potential solution to
   these limitations: the use of new ``precision{''} fMRI approaches that
   shift the focus of analysis from groups to single individuals through
   the use of extended data acquisition strategies. We begin by discussing
   the potential advantages of fMRI functional connectivity methods for
   improving our understanding of functional neuroanatomy and disruptions
   in psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the budding field of precision
   fMRI and findings garnered from this work. We demonstrate that precision
   fMRI can improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures,
   while showing high stability and sensitivity to individual differences.
   We close by discussing the application of these approaches to clinical
   settings.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques and
   electroencephalography (EEG) were used to investigate sleep with a focus
   on impaired arousal mechanisms in disorders of arousal (DOAs). With a
   prevalence of 2-4\% in adults, DOAs are significant disorders that are
   currently gaining attention among physicians. The paper describes a
   simultaneous EEG and fMRI experiment conducted in adult individuals with
   DOAs (n=10). Both EEG and fMRI data were validated by reproducing well
   established EEG and fMRI associations. A method for identification of
   both brain functional areas and EEG rhythms associated with DOAs in
   shallow sleep was designed. Significant differences between patients and
   controls were found in delta, theta, and alpha bands during awakening
   epochs. General linear models of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal
   have shown the secondary visual cortex and dorsal posterior cingulate
   cortex to be associated with alpha spectral power fluctuations, and the
   precuneus with delta spectral power fluctuations, specifically in
   patients and not in controls. Future EEG-fMRI sleep studies should also
   consider subject comfort as an important aspect in the experimental
   design.},

Title = {Independent component analysis: a reliable alternative to general linear
   model for task-based fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable
   tool for the presurgical evaluation of patients undergoing
   neurosurgeries. Although many pre-processing steps have been modified
   according to advances in recent years, statistical analysis has remained
   largely the same since the first days of fMRI. In this study, we
   examined the ability of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate
   the activation of a language task in fMRI, and we compared it with the
   results of the General Lineal Model (GLM).
   Methods: Sixty patients undergoing evaluation for brain surgery due to
   various brain lesions and/or epilepsy and 20 control subjects completed
   an fMRI language mapping protocol that included three tasks, resulting
   in 259 fMRI scans. Depending on brain lesion characteristics, patients
   were allocated to (1) static/chronic not-expanding lesions (Group 1) and
   (2) progressive/expanding lesions (Group 2). GLM and ICA statistical
   maps were evaluated by fMRI experts to assess the performance of each
   technique.
   Results: In the control group, ICA and GLM maps were similar without any
   superiority of either technique. In Group 1 and Group 2, ICA performed
   statistically better than GLM, with a p-value of < 0.01801 and < 0.0237,
   respectively. This indicated that ICA performs as well as GLM when the
   subjects are able to cooperate well (less movement, good task
   performance), but ICA could outperform GLM in the patient groups. When
   both techniques were combined, 240 out of 259 scans produced reliable
   results, showing that the sensitivity of task-based fMRI can be
   increased when both techniques are integrated with the clinical setup.
   Conclusion: ICA may be slightly more advantageous, compared to GLM, in
   patients with brain lesions, across the range of pathologies included in
   our population and independent of symptoms chronicity. Our findings
   suggest that GLM analysis may be more susceptible to brain activity
   perturbations induced by a variety of lesions or scanner-induced
   artifacts due to motion or other factors. In our research, we
   demonstrated that ICA is able to provide fMRI results that can be used
   in surgery, taking into account patient and task-wise aspects that
   differ from those when fMRI is used in research.},

Title = {Cerebral Autoregulation Evidenced by Synchronized Low Frequency
   Oscillations in Blood Pressure and Resting-State fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a
   widely used technique for mapping the brain's functional architecture,
   so delineating the main sources of variance comprising the signal is
   crucial. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin,
   but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation
   (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal
   within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible
   device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of
   beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with
   rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n = 9; 5 male) completed two
   20-min rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different
   frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at
   approximately 0.1 Hz show a high degree of spatially structured
   correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across
   subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition
   explain similar to 2.2\% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance.
   Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used
   to collect 10-min rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group
   of healthy adults (n = 5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to
   estimate the R-2{*} decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to
   strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e.,
   blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a
   significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic
   physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized
   BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local
   neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD
   signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood
   flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely
   reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is
   a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral
   autoregulation with high spatial resolution.},

Abstract = {Sleep is ubiquitous and essential, but its mechanisms remain unclear.
   Studies in animals and humans have provided insights of sleep at vastly
   different spatiotemporal scales. However, challenges remain to integrate
   local and global information of sleep. Therefore, we developed sleep
   fMRI based on simultaneous electrophysiology at 9.4 T in male mice.
   Optimized un-anesthetized mouse fMRI setup allowed manifestation of NREM
   and REM sleep, and a large sleep fMRI dataset was collected and openly
   accessible. State dependent global patterns were revealed, and state
   transitions were found to be global, asymmetrical and sequential, which
   can be predicted up to 17.8 s using LSTM models. Importantly, sleep fMRI
   with hippocampal recording revealed potentiated sharp-wave ripple
   triggered global patterns during NREM than awake state, potentially
   attributable to co-occurrence of spindle events. To conclude, we
   established mouse sleep fMRI with simultaneous electrophysiology, and
   demonstrated its capability by revealing global dynamics of state
   transitions and neural events.
   Mechanisms of sleep remain elusive. Here, authors developed mouse sleep
   fMRI based on simultaneous electrophysiology and mapped global and
   sequential state transition patterns, together with global patterns
   triggered by SWRs in NREM and awake states.},

Title = {Mapping critical hubs of receptive and expressive language using MEG: A
   comparison against fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The complexity of the widespread language network makes it challenging
   for accurate localization and lateralization. Using large-scale
   connectivity and graph-theoretical analyses of task-based
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), we aimed to provide robust representations
   of receptive and expressive language processes, comparable with spatial
   profiles of corresponding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   We examined MEG and fMRI data from 12 healthy young adults (age 20-37
   years) completing covert auditory word-recognition task (WRT) and covert
   auditory verb-generation task (VGT). For MEG language mapping, broadband
   (3-30 Hz) beamformer sources were estimated, voxel-level connectivity
   was quantified using phase locking value, and highly connected hubs were
   characterized using eigenvector centrality graph measure. fMRI data were
   analyzed using a classic general linear model approach. A laterality
   index (LI) was computed for 20 language-specific frontotemporal regions
   for both MEG and fMRI. MEG network analysis showed bilateral and
   symmetrically distributed hubs within the left and right superior
   temporal gyrus (STG) during WRT and predominant hubs in left inferior
   prefrontal gyrus (IFG) during VGT. MEG and fMRI localization maps showed
   high correlation values within frontotemporal regions during WRT and VGT
   (r = 0.63, 0.74, q < 0.05, respectively). Despite good concordance in
   localization, notable discordances were observed in lateralization
   between MEG and fMRI. During WRT, MEG favored a left-hemispheric
   dominance of left STG (LI = 0.25 +/- 0.22) whereas fMRI supported a
   bilateral representation of STG (LI = 0.08 +/- 0.2). Laterality of MEG
   and fMRI during VGT consistently showed a strong asymmetry in left IFG
   regions (MEG-LI = 0.45 +/- 0.35 and fMRI-LI = 0.46 +/- 0.13). Our
   results demonstrate the utility of a large-scale connectivity and graph
   theoretical analyses for robust identification of language-specific
   regions. MEG hubs are in great agreement with the literature in
   revealing with canonical and extra-canonical language sites, thus
   providing additional support for the underlying topological organization
   of receptive and expressive language cortices. Discordances in
   lateralization may emphasize the need for multimodal integration of MEG
   and fMRI to obtain an excellent predictive value in a heterogeneous
   healthy population and patients with neurosurgical conditions.},

Abstract = {Background: Over the past 30 years, functionalmagnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool to non-invasively study the
   activity and function of the human brain. But along with the potential
   of fMRI to shed light on neurological, psychiatric, and psychological
   processes, there are methodological challenges and criticisms. Aim: We
   herein provide an fMRI primer designed for a diverse audience, from the
   neuroimaging novice to the experienced user. Methods: This primer is
   structured as follows: Part 1: Overview: ``What is fMRI and what can it
   tell us?.{''} Part 2: Basic fMRI principles: MR physics, the BOLD
   signal, and components of a typical scan session. Part 3: Basic fMRI
   experimental design: why timing is critical, and common sources of noise
   in the signal. Part 4: Basic fMRI analysis methods: software, the 3
   stages of data analysis (preprocessing, individual, and group level),
   and a survey of advanced topics and methods including connectivity,
   machine learning, and assessing statistical significance. Part 5:
   Criticism, crises, and opportunities related to power of studies,
   computing requirements, logistical, and interpretational challenges, and
   methodological debate (assessing causality, circular correlations, and
   open science best practices). Outcomes n/a Clinical Translation: fMRI
   has primarily been used in clinical research to elucidate the brain
   correlates of sexual behavior. The translational potential of the method
   into clinical practice has not yet been realizedfMRI has primarily been
   used in clinical research to elucidate the brain correlates of sexual
   behavior. The translational potential of the method into clinical
   practice has not yet been realized Strengths and Limitations: fMRI is a
   useful and powerful tool for understanding the brain basis of human
   sexuality. However, it is also expensive, requires extensive methods
   expertise, and lacks the precision needed to be immediately translatable
   to clinical practice. The recency of the method, need for basic
   research, technical limitations, as well as inherent variability in
   individuals brain activity also impact the pace at which fMRI for sexual
   medicine can move from the scanner to the clinic. Conclusion: This
   primer provides the novice an understanding of the appropriate uses and
   limitations of fMRI, and for the experienced user, a concise update on
   current issues and methodological advances.},

Abstract = {The study of spontaneous brain activity based on BOLD-fMRI may be
   seriously compromised by the presence of signal fluctuations of
   non-neuronal origin, most prominently due to cardiac and respiratory
   mechanisms. Methods used for modeling and correction of the so-called
   physiological noise usually rely on the concurrent measurement of
   cardiac and respiratory signals. In simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings,
   which are primarily aimed at the study of spontaneous brain activity,
   the electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically measured as part of the EEG
   setup but respiratory data are not generally available. Here, we propose
   to use the ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signal estimated by Empirical
   Mode Decomposition (EMD) as a surrogate of the respiratory signal, for
   retrospective physiological noise correction of typical simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI data. A physiological noise model based on these physiological
   signals (P-PNM) complemented with fMRI-derived noise regressors was
   generated, and evaluated, for 17 simultaneous EEG-fMRI datasets acquired
   from a group of seven epilepsy patients imaged at 3 T. The respiratory
   components of P-PNM were found to explain BOLD variance significantly in
   addition to the cardiac components, suggesting that the EDR signal was
   successfully extracted from the ECG, and P-PNM outperformed an
   image-based model (I-PNM) in terms of total BOLD variance explained.
   Further, the impact of the correction using P-PNM on fMRI mapping of
   patient-specific epileptic networks and the resting-state default mode
   network (DMN) was assessed in terms of sensitivity and specificity and,
   when compared with an ICA-based procedure and a standard pre-processing
   pipeline, P-PNM achieved the best performance. Overall, our results
   support the feasibility and utility of extracting physiological noise
   models of the BOLD signal resorting to ECG data exclusively, with
   substantial impact on the simultaneous EEG-fMRI mapping of resting-state
   networks, and, most importantly, epileptic networks where sensitivity
   and specificity are still limited.},

Title = {Generalizing prediction of task-evoked brain activity across datasets
   and populations},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {276},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Predictions of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   from task-free resting-state (rs) fMRI have gained popularity over the
   past decade. This method holds a great promise for studying individual
   vari-ability in brain function without the need to perform highly
   demanding tasks. However, in order to be broadly used, prediction models
   must prove to generalize beyond the dataset they were trained on. In
   this work, we test the generalizability of prediction of task-fMRI from
   rs-fMRI across sites, MRI vendors and age-groups. Moreover, we
   investigate the data requirements for successful prediction. We use the
   Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset to explore how different
   combinations of training sample sizes and number of fMRI datapoints
   affect prediction success in various cognitive tasks. We then apply
   models trained on HCP data to predict brain acti-vations in data from a
   different site, a different MRI vendor (Phillips vs. Siemens scanners)
   and a different age group (children from the HCP-development project).
   We demonstrate that, depending on the task, a training set of
   approximately 20 participants with 100 fMRI timepoints each yields the
   largest gain in model performance. Nevertheless, further increasing
   sample size and number of timepoints results in significantly improved
   predic-tions, until reaching approximately 450-600 training participants
   and 800-1000 timepoints. Overall, the number of fMRI timepoints
   influences prediction success more than the sample size. We further show
   that models trained on adequate amounts of data successfully generalize
   across sites, vendors and age groups and provide predictions that are
   both accurate and individual-specific. These findings suggest that
   large-scale publicly available datasets may be utilized to study brain
   function in smaller, unique samples.},

Title = {Bayesian fusion and multimodal DCM for EEG and fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {211},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This paper asks whether integrating multimodal EEG and fMRI data offers
   a better characterisation of functional brain architectures than either
   modality alone. This evaluation rests upon a dynamic causal model that
   generates both EEG and fMRI data from the same neuronal dynamics. We
   introduce the use of Bayesian fusion to provide informative (empirical)
   neuronal priors - derived from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of EEG
   data - for subsequent DCM of fMRI data. To illustrate this procedure, we
   generated synthetic EEG and fMRI timeseries for a mismatch negativity
   (or auditory oddball) paradigm, using biologically plausible model
   parameters (i.e., posterior expectations from a DCM of empirical, open
   access, EEG data). Using model inversion, we found that Bayesian fusion
   provided a substantial improvement in marginal likelihood or model
   evidence, indicating a more efficient estimation of model parameters, in
   relation to inverting fMRI data alone. We quantified the benefits of
   multimodal fusion with the information gain pertaining to neuronal and
   haemodynamic parameters - as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence
   between their prior and posterior densities. Remarkably, this analysis
   suggested that EEG data can improve estimates of haemodynamic
   parameters; thereby furnishing proof-of-principle that Bayesian fusion
   of EEG and fMRI is necessary to resolve conditional dependencies between
   neuronal and haemodynamic estimators. These results suggest that
   Bayesian fusion may offer a useful approach that exploits the
   complementary temporal (EEG) and spatial (fMRI) precision of different
   data modalities. We envisage the procedure could be applied to any
   multimodal dataset that can be explained by a DCM with a common neuronal
   parameterisation.},

Abstract = {We examined the effect of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on
   resting state brain activity using fMRI (rs-fMRI) in patients with
   bilateral vestibulopathy. Based on our previous findings, we
   hypothesized that GVS, which excites the vestibular nerve fibers, (a)
   increases functional connectivity in temporoparietal regions processing
   vestibular signals, and (b) alleviates abnormal visual-vestibular
   interaction. Rs-fMRI of 26 patients and 26 age-matched healthy control
   subjects was compared before and after GVS. The stimulation elicited a
   motion percept in all participants. Using different analyses (degree
   centrality, DC; fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
   {[}fALFF] and seed-based functional connectivity, FC), group comparisons
   revealed smaller rs-fMRI in the right Rolandic operculum of patients.
   After GVS, rs-fMRI increased in the right Rolandic operculum in both
   groups and in the patients' cerebellar Crus 1 which was related to
   vestibular hypofunction. GVS elicited a fALFF increase in the visual
   cortex of patients that was inversely correlated with the patients'
   rating of perceived dizziness. After GVS, FC between parietoinsular
   cortex and higher visual areas increased in healthy controls but not in
   patients. In conclusion, short-term GVS is able to modulate rs-fMRI in
   healthy controls and BV patients. GVS elicits an increase of the reduced
   rs-fMRI in the patients' right Rolandic operculum, which may be an
   important contribution to restore the disturbed visual-vestibular
   interaction. The GVS-induced changes in the cerebellum and the visual
   cortex were associated with lower dizziness-related handicaps in
   patients, possibly reflecting beneficial neural plasticity that might
   subserve visual-vestibular compensation of deficient self-motion
   perception.},

Abstract = {In preoperative planning, fMRI and repetitive navigated transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS) repeatedly revealed differences in the
   detected language sites, which can be attributed to tumor-induced
   oxygenation changes impairing the accuracy of fMRI. We therefore
   compared the accordance of those techniques in healthy subjects using
   exactly the same tasks in both investigations. 19 healthy right-handed
   subjects performed object naming, pseudoword reading, verb generation,
   and action naming during fMRI at 3T and rTMS. For rTMS language mapping,
   we stimulated 46 cortical spots over the left hemisphere; each site was
   stimulated for three times. Language positive points during rTMS for
   one, two, or three errors out the three stimulations per spot (1/3, 2/3,
   3/3) were exported via DICOM, and compared to the positive fMRI
   clusters. As a result of this comparison, the best correlation was
   observed between 3/3 errors and fMRI for pseudoword reading and verb
   generation with t-values of p(u)<0.001, uncorrected for multiple
   comparisons, on average across the whole rTMS-spot map. We found a close
   spatial agreement between several rTMS-spots (2/3 and 3/3 errors) and
   fMRI clusters accentuated in the frontal lobe, followed by the parietal
   lobe and less in the temporal lobe. Compared to the fMRI clusters, there
   was a higher congruence for 2/3 and 3/3 errors than for 1/3 errors.
   Overall, results of language mapping in healthy subjects by fMRI and
   rTMS correspond well yet depending on the used language task.},

Abstract = {Wearing a face mask has become essential to contain the spread of
   COVID-19 and has become mandatory when collecting fMRI data at most
   research institutions. Here, we investigate the effects of wearing a
   surgical mask on fMRI data in n = 37 healthy participants. Activations
   during finger tapping, emotional face matching, working memory tasks,
   and rest were examined. Preliminary fMRI analyses show that despite the
   different mask states, resting-state signals and task activations were
   relatively similar. Resting-state functional connectivity showed
   negligible attenuation patterns in mask-on compared with mask-off.
   Task-based ROI analysis also demonstrated no significant difference
   between the two mask states under each contrast investigated.
   Notwithstanding the overall insignificant effects, these results
   indicate that wearing a face mask during fMRI has little to no

Abstract = {Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data typically
   involves over one hundred thousand independent statistical tests;
   therefore, it is necessary to correct for multiple comparisons to
   control familywise error. In a recent paper, Eklund, Nichols, and
   Knutsson used resting-state fMRI data to evaluate commonly employed
   methods to correct for multiple comparisons and reported unacceptable
   rates of familywise error. Eklund et al.'s analysis was based on the
   assumption that resting-state fMRI data reflect null data; however,
   their null data' actually reflected default network activity that
   inflated familywise error. As such, Eklund et al.'s results provide no
   basis to question the validity of the thousands of published fMRI
   studies that have corrected for multiple comparisons or the commonly
   employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons.},

Abstract = {One promising approach for mapping CMRO2 is dual-calibrated functional
   MRI (dc-fMRI). This method exploits the Fick Principle to combine
   estimates of CBF from ASL, and OEF derived from BOLD-ASL measurements
   during arterial O-2 and CO2 modulations. Multiple gas modulations are
   required to decouple OEF and deoxyhemoglobin-sensitive blood volume. We
   propose an alternative single gas calibrated fMRI framework, integrating
   a model of oxygen transport, that links blood volume and CBF to OEF and
   creates a mapping between the maximum BOLD signal, CBF and OEF (and
   CMRO2). Simulations demonstrated the method's viability within
   physiological ranges of mitochondrial oxygen pressure, PmO2, and mean
   capillary transit time. A dc-fMRI experiment, performed on 20 healthy
   subjects using O-2 and CO2 challenges, was used to validate the
   approach. The validation conveyed expected estimates of model parameters
   (e.g., low PmO2), with spatially uniform OEF maps (grey matter, GM, OEF
   spatial standard deviation approximate to 0.13). GM OEF estimates
   obtained with hypercapnia calibrated fMRI correlated with dc-fMRI (r =
   0.65, p = 2 center dot 10(-3)). For 12 subjects, OEF measured with
   dc-fMRI and the single gas calibration method were correlated with
   whole-brain OEF derived from phase measures in the superior sagittal
   sinus (r = 0.58, p = 0.048; r = 0.64, p = 0.025 respectively).
   Simplified calibrated fMRI using hypercapnia holds promise for clinical
   application.},

Title = {Exploring the relation between BOLD fMRI and cognitive performance using

Journal = {EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {BOLD fMRI is increasingly used mostly in an observational way to probe
   the effect of genotypes or therapeutic intervention in normal and
   diseased subjects. We use a mechanism-based quantitative systems
   pharmacology computer model of a human cortical microcircuit, previously
   calibrated for the 2-back working memory paradigm, adding established
   biophysical principles, of glucose metabolism, oxygen consumption,
   neurovascular effects and the paramagnetic impact on blood oxygen levels
   to calculate a readout for the voxel-based BOLD fMRI signal. The
   objective was to study the effect of the Catechol-O-methyl Transferase
   Val158Met (COMT) genotype on performance and BOLD fMRI. While the
   simulation suggests that on average virtual COMTVV genotype subjects
   perform worse, subjects with lower GABA, lower 5-HT3 and higher 5-HT1A
   activation can improve cognitive performance to the level of COMTMM
   subjects but at the expense of higher BOLD fMRI signal. In a
   schizophrenia condition, increased NMDA, GABA tone and noise levels, and
   lower D1R activity can improve cognitive outcome with greater BOLD fMRI
   signal in COMT Val-carriers. We further generate hypotheses about why
   ketamine in healthy controls increases the BOLD fMRI signal but reduces
   cognitive performance. These simulations suggest a strong non-linear
   relationship between BOLD fMRI signal and cognitive performance. When
   validated, this mechanistic approach can be useful for moving beyond the
   descriptive nature of BOLD fMRI imaging and supporting the proper
   interpretation of imaging biomarkers in CNS disorders. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {Functional brain connectivity in resting-state fMRI using phase and
   magnitude data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {293},
Pages = {299-309},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Background: The output of BOLD fMRI consists of a pair of magnitude and
   phase components. While the magnitude data has been widely accepted for
   brain function analysis, we can also make use of the phase data
   (unwrapped) since this is a good representation of the internal magnetic
   field. In this work, we discuss the use of fMRI phase data for brain
   function analysis.
   New methods: The fMRI phase data taken from 100 subjects are
   preprocessed using standard SPM approaches. Group independent component
   analysis (ICA) is applied to the magnitude and phase data separately. We
   then compare the spatial patterns for both magnitude and phase data
   using an empirical spatial smoothing procedure. We also evaluate the
   magnitude and phase functional network connectivity (FC) matrices.
   Results: We observed the positive/negative correlation-balanced
   functional connectivity in phase data, which is distinct from the
   positive correlation prevalence in magnitude data. The phase FC (pFC)
   structure is quite different from the magnitude FC (mFC) in functional
   clusters (on-diagonal blocks or cliques) and inter-cluster couplings
   (off-diagonal blocks).
   Comparison with existing: Methods since both the magnitude and phase
   data of the fMRI signals are generated from the same magnetic source,
   either can be useful for brain function analysis from different
   perspective (per different measurements). Herein, we report on making
   use of resting-state fMRI phase data for brain functional analysis in
   comparison with magnitude data. This exploration in phase fMRI may
   provide a new arena for more comprehensive brain function analysis. (C)

Title = {From mathematics to medicine: A practical primer on topological data
   analysis (TDA) and the development of related analytic tools for the
   functional discovery of latent structure in fMRI data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {fMRI is the preeminent method for collecting signals from the human
   brain in vivo, for using these signals in the service of functional
   discovery, and relating these discoveries to anatomical structure.
   Numerous computational and mathematical techniques have been deployed to
   extract information from the fMRI signal. Yet, the application of
   Topological Data Analyses (TDA) remain limited to certain sub-areas such
   as connectomics (that is, with summarized versions of fMRI data). While
   connectomics is a natural and important area of application of TDA,
   applications of TDA in the service of extracting structure from the
   (non-summarized) fMRI data itself are heretofore nonexistent.
   ``Structure{''} within fMRI data is determined by dynamic fluctuations
   in spatially distributed signals over time, and TDA is well positioned
   to help researchers better characterize mass dynamics of the signal by
   rigorously capturing shape within it. To accurately motivate this idea,
   we a) survey an established method in TDA ({''}persistent homology{''})
   to reveal and describe how complex structures can be extracted from data
   sets generally, and b) describe how persistent homology can be applied
   specifically to fMRI data. We provide explanations for some of the
   mathematical underpinnings of TDA (with expository figures), building
   ideas in the following sequence: a) fMRI researchers can and should use
   TDA to extract structure from their data; b) this extraction serves an
   important role in the endeavor of functional discovery, and c) TDA
   approaches can complement other established approaches toward fMRI
   analyses (for which we provide examples). We also provide detailed
   applications of TDA to fMRI data collected using established paradigms,
   and offer our software pipeline for readers interested in emulating our
   methods. This working overview is both an inter-disciplinary synthesis
   of ideas (to draw researchers in TDA and fMRI toward each other) and a
   detailed description of methods that can motivate collaborative
   research.},

Title = {Intracortical smoothing of small-voxel fMRI data can provide increased
   detection power without spatial resolution losses compared to
   conventional large-voxel fMRI data},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {189},
Pages = {601-614},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Continued improvement in MRI acquisition technology has made functional
   MRI (fMRI) with small isotropic voxel sizes down to 1 mm and below more
   commonly available. Although many conventional fMRI studies seek to
   investigate regional patterns of cortical activation for which
   conventional voxel sizes of 3 mm and larger provide sufficient spatial
   resolution, smaller voxels can help avoid contamination from adjacent
   white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and thereby increase
   the specificity of fMRI to signal changes within the gray matter.
   Unfortunately, temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), a metric of fMRI
   sensitivity, is reduced in high-resolution acquisitions, which offsets
   the benefits of small voxels. Here we introduce a framework that
   combines small, isotropic fMRI voxels acquired at 7 T field strength
   with a novel anatomically-informed, surface mesh-navigated spatial
   smoothing that can provide both higher detection power and higher
   resolution than conventional voxel sizes. Our smoothing approach uses a
   family of intracortical surface meshes and allows for kernels of various
   shapes and sizes, including curved 3D kernels that adapt to and track
   the cortical folding pattern. Our goal is to restrict smoothing to the
   cortical gray matter ribbon and avoid noise contamination from CSF and
   signal dilution from WM via partial volume effects. We found that the
   intracortical kernel that maximizes tSNR does not maximize percent
   signal change (Delta S/S), and therefore the kernel configuration that
   optimizes detection power cannot be determined from tSNR considerations
   alone. However, several kernel configurations provided a favorable
   balance between boosting tSNR and Delta S/S, and allowed a 1.1-mm
   isotropic fMRI acquisition to have higher performance after smoothing
   (in terms of both detection power and spatial resolution) compared to an
   unsmoothed 3.0-mm isotropic fMRI acquisition. Overall, the results of
   this study support the strategy of acquiring voxels smaller than the
   cortical thickness, even for studies not requiring high spatial
   resolution, and smoothing them down within the cortical ribbon with a
   kernel of an appropriate shape to achieve the best performance-thus
   decoupling the choice of fMRI voxel size from the spatial resolution
   requirements of the particular study. The improvement of this new
   intracortical smoothing approach over conventional surface-based
   smoothing is expected to be modest for conventional resolutions, however
   the improvement is expected to increase with higher resolutions. This
   framework can also be applied to anatomically-informed intracortical
   smoothing of higher-resolution data (e.g. along columns and layers) in
   studies with prior information about the spatial structure of
   activation.},

Title = {Non-BOLD contrast for laminar fMRI in humans: CBF, CBV, and
   CMR<sub>O2</sub>},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {742-760},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) contrast indirectly probes neuronal activity
   changes via evoked cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume
   (CBV) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) changes. The
   gradient-echo BOLD signal is mostly sensitive to ascending veins in the
   tissue and to pial veins. Thereby, the achievable spatial specificity to
   neuronal activation is limited. Furthermore, the non-linear interaction
   of CBF, CBV and CMRO2 can hamper quantitative interpretations of the
   BOLD signal across cortical depths with different baseline physiology.
   Measuring CBF, CBV or CMRO2 directly on a depth-dependent level has the
   potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we review these
   candidates of physiologically well-defined contrasts with the particular
   focus on arterial spin labeling (ASL), vascular space occupancy (VASO)
   and calibrated fMRI. These methods are reviewed with respect to their
   fMRI sequence parameter space and the applicability for neuroscientific
   studies in humans. We show representative results of depth-dependent
   `non-BOLD-fMRI' in humans and their spatiotemporal characteristics. We
   conclude that non-BOLD methods are promising alternatives compared to
   conventional fMRI as they can provide improved spatial specificity,
   quantifiability and, hence, physiological interpretability as a function
   of cortical depth. At submillimeter resolution with inherently low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), however, their use is still challenging.
   Nevertheless, we believe that `non-BOLD-fMRI' is a useful alternative
   for depth-dependent investigations, by providing valuable insights into
   neurovascular coupling models that facilitate the interpretability of
   fMRI for neuroscientific applications.},

Title = {Population-Level Correction of Systematic Motion Artifacts in fMRI in

Pages = {397-408},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDThe aim of this study was to reveal potential sources of
   systematic motion artifacts in stroke functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) focusing on those causing stimulus-correlated motion on
   the individual-level and separate the motion effect on the fMRI signal
   changing from the activation-induced alteration at population level.
   METHODSEleven ischemic stroke patients were examined by fMRI. The fMRI
   paradigm was based on passive ankle movement on both the healthy and the
   paretic leg's side. Three individual-level motion correction strategies
   were compared and we introduced five measures to characterize each
   subjects' in-scanner relative head movement. After analyzing the
   correlation of motion parameters and the subjects' physiological scale
   scores, we selected a parameter to model the motion-related artifacts in
   the second-level analysis.
   RESULTSAt first (individual) level analysis, the noise-component
   correction-based CompCor method provided the highest -log10(p) value of
   cluster-level occurrence probability at 12.4/13.6 for healthy and
   paretic side stimulus, respectively, with a maximal z-value of 15/16.3.
   Including the motion parameter at second (group) level resulted in lower
   cluster occurrence values at 10.9/5.55 while retaining the maximal
   z-value.
   CONCLUSIONSWe proposed a postprocessing pipeline for ischemic stroke
   fMRI data that combine the CompCor correction at first level with the
   modeling of motion effect at second-level analysis by a parameter
   obtained from fMRI data. Our solution is applicable for any fMRI-based
   stroke rehabilitation study since it does not require any MRI-compatible
   motion capture system and is based on commonly used methods.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that, the third generation of neural networks-the
   spiking neural networks (SNNs), can be used to model dynamic,
   spatio-temporal, cognitive brain processes measured as functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This paper proposes a novel
   method based on the NeuCube SNN architecture for which the following new
   algorithms are introduced: fMRI data encoding into spike sequences; deep
   unsupervised learning of fMRI data in a 3-D SNN reservoir;
   classification of cognitive states; and connectivity visualization and
   analysis for the purpose of understanding cognitive dynamics. The method
   is illustrated on two case studies of cognitive data modeling from a
   benchmark fMRI data set of seeing a picture versus reading a sentence.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a pioneering technology
   for studying brain activity in response to mental stimuli. Although
   efficient designs on these fMRI experiments are important for rendering
   precise statistical inference on brain functions, they are not
   systematically constructed. Design with circulant property is crucial
   for estimating a hemo-dynamic response function (HRF) and discussing
   fMRI experimental optimality. In this paper, we develop a theory that
   not only successfully explains the structure of a circulant design, but
   also provides a method of constructing efficient fMRI designs
   systematically. We further provide a class of two-level circulant
   designs with good performance (statistically optimal), and they can be
   used to estimate the HRF of a stimulus type and study the comparison of
   two HRFs. Some efficient three-and four-levels circulant designs are
   also provided, and we proved the existence of a class of circulant
   orthogonal arrays.},

Title = {Clinical benefit of presurgical EEG-fMRI in difficult-to-localize focal

Abstract = {Objective The aim of this report is to present our clinical experience
   of electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (EEG-fMRI) in localizing the epileptogenic focus, and to evaluate the
   clinical impact and challenges associated with the use of EEG-fMRI in
   pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Methods We identified EEG-fMRI studies
   (n = 118) in people with focal epilepsy performed at our center from
   2003 to 2018. Participants were referred from our Comprehensive Epilepsy
   Program in an exploratory research effort to address often difficult
   clinical questions, due to complex and difficult-to-localize epilepsy.
   We assessed the success of each study, the clinical utility of the
   result, and when surgery was performed, the postoperative outcome.
   Results Overall, 50\% of EEG-fMRI studies were successful, meaning that
   data were of good quality and interictal epileptiform discharges were
   recorded. With an altered recruitment strategy since 2012 with increased
   inclusion of patients who were inpatients for video-EEG monitoring, we
   found that this patients in this selected group were more likely to have
   epileptic discharges detected during EEG-fMRI (96\% of inpatients vs
   29\% of outpatients, P<.0001). To date, 48\% (57 of 118) of patients
   have undergone epilepsy surgery. In 10 cases (17\% of the 59 successful
   studies) the EEG-fMRI result had a ``critical impact{''} on the surgical
   decision. These patients were difficult to localize because of subtle
   abnormalities, apparently normal MRI, or extensive structural
   abnormalities. All 10 had a good seizure outcome at 1 year after surgery
   (mean follow-up 6.5 years). Significance EEG-fMRI results can assist
   identification of the epileptogenic focus in otherwise
   difficult-to-localize cases of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Surgery
   determined largely by localization from the EEG-fMRI result can lead to
   good seizure outcomes. A limitation of this study is its retrospective
   design with nonconsecutive recruitment. Prospective clinical trials with
   well-defined inclusion criteria are needed to determine the overall
   benefit of EEG-fMRI for preoperative localization and postoperative
   outcome in focal epilepsy.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Passband balanced steady state free precession (b-SSFP) fMRI employs the
   flat portion of the SSFP off-resonance response to obtain microscopic
   susceptibility changes elicited by changes in blood oxygenation
   following enhancement in neuronal activity. This technique can reduce
   geometric distortion and signal dropout while maintaining rapid
   acquisition and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with
   traditional fMRI techniques. In the study, we developed a novel
   multi-phase passband b-SSFP fMRI technique that can achieve a spatial
   resolution of a few mm(3) and a high temporal sampling rate of 50 ms per
   slice at 7 Tesla. This technique was further applied for an
   event-related (ER) fMRI paradigm. As a comparison, gradient-echo
   echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) with similar spatial resolution and
   temporal sampling rate was carried out for the same ER-fMRI experiment.
   Experiments with visual cortex stimulation were carried out at 7 Tesla
   to demonstrate whether the multi-phase b-SSFP technique and GE-EPI are
   able to differentiate temporal delays in hemodynamic response function
   (HRF) separated by 100 ms in stimulus onset. Consistent with ERP
   results, the upslope of the HRF of both techniques can differentiate 100
   ms delay in stimulus onset, with the former showing a lower level of
   intersubject variability. The present study demonstrated that the
   multi-phase passband b-SSFP fMRI technique can be applied for resolving
   neuronal events on the order of 100 ms at ultrahigh magnetic fields. (C)

Abstract = {The mechanisms which generate fMRI signal correlations across the brain
   are not fully understood. Here, the authors record ultrafast fMRI
   signals in anesthetized female rats to demonstrate intrinsic macroscale
   oscillatory modes which drive correlated activity between distant
   regions.
   Spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   signals correlate across distant brain areas, shaping functionally
   relevant intrinsic networks. However, the generative mechanism of fMRI
   signal correlations, and in particular the link with locally-detected
   ultra-slow oscillations, are not fully understood. To investigate this
   link, we record ultrafast ultrahigh field fMRI signals (9.4 Tesla,
   temporal resolution = 38 milliseconds) from female rats across three
   anesthesia conditions. Power at frequencies extending up to 0.3 Hz is
   detected consistently across rat brains and is modulated by anesthesia
   level. Principal component analysis reveals a repertoire of modes, in
   which transient oscillations organize with fixed phase relationships
   across distinct cortical and subcortical structures. Oscillatory modes
   are found to vary between conditions, resonating at faster frequencies
   under medetomidine sedation and reducing both in number, frequency, and
   duration with the addition of isoflurane. Peaking in power within clear
   anatomical boundaries, these oscillatory modes point to an emergent
   systemic property. This work provides additional insight into the origin
   of oscillations detected in fMRI and the organizing principles
   underpinning spontaneous long-range functional connectivity.},

Abstract = {Memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations
   show age-related differences across multiple brain regions that can be
   captured in summary statistics like single-value scores. Recently, we
   described two single-value scores reflecting deviations from
   prototypical whole-brain fMRI activity of young adults during novelty
   processing and successful encoding. Here, we investigate the
   brain-behavior associations of these scores with age-related
   neurocognitive changes in 153 healthy middle-aged and older adults. All
   scores were associated with episodic recall performance. The memory
   network scores, but not the novelty network scores, additionally
   correlated with medial temporal gray matter and other neuropsychological
   measures including flexibility. Our results thus suggest that
   novelty-network-based fMRI scores show high brain-behavior associations
   with episodic memory and that encoding-network-based fMRI scores
   additionally capture individual differences in other aging-related
   functions. More generally, our results suggest that single-value scores
   of memory-related fMRI provide a comprehensive measure of individual
   differences in network dysfunction that may contribute to age-related
   cognitive decline.},

Title = {Molecular fMRI of neurochemical signaling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {364},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely applied technique
   for brain-wide measurement of neural function in humans and animals. In
   conventional functional MRI (fMRI), brain signaling is detected
   indirectly, via localized activity-dependent changes in regional blood
   flow, oxygenation, and volume, to which MRI contrast can be readily
   sensitized. Although such hemodynamic fMRI methods are powerful tools
   for analysis of brain activity, they lack specificity for the many
   molecules and cell types that play functionally distinct roles in neural
   processing. A suite of techniques collectively known to as ``molecular
   fMRI,{''} addresses this limitation by permitting MRI-based detection of
   specific molecular processes in deep brain tissue. This review discusses
   how molecular fMRI is coming to be used in the study of neurochemical
   dynamics that mediate intercellular communication in the brain.
   Neurochemical molecular fMRI is a potentially powerful approach for
   mechanistic analysis of brain-wide function, but the techniques are
   still in early stages of development. Here we provide an overview of the
   major advances and results that have been achieved to date, as well as
   directions for further development.},

Title = {Multimodal hyper-connectivity of functional networks using
   functionally-weighted LASSO for MCI classification},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {80-96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent works have shown that hyper-networks derived from
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, where an edge (called
   hyper-edge) can be connected to more than two nodes, are effective
   biomarkers for MCI classification. Although BOLD fMRI is a high temporal
   resolution fMRI approach to assess alterations in brain networks, it
   cannot pinpoint to a single correlation of neuronal activity since BOLD
   signals are composite. In contrast, arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a
   lower temporal resolution fMRI technique for measuring cerebral blood
   flow (CBF) that can provide quantitative, direct brain network
   physiology measurements. This paper proposes a novel sparse regression
   algorithm for inference of the integrated hyper-connectivity networks
   from BOLD fMRI and ASL fMRI. Specifically, a least absolution shrinkage
   and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, which is constrained by the
   functional connectivity derived from ASL fMRI, is employed to estimate
   hyper-connectivity for characterizing BOLD-fMRI-based functional
   interaction among multiple regions. An ASL-derived functional
   connectivity is constructed by using an Ultra-GroupLASSO-UOLS algorithm,
   where the combination of ultra-least squares (ULS) criterion with a
   group LASSO (GroupLASSO) algorithm is applied to detect the topology of
   ASL-based functional connectivity networks, and then an ultra-orthogonal
   least squares (UOLS) algorithm is used to estimate the connectivity
   strength. By combining the complementary characterization conveyed by
   rs-fMRI and ASL fMRI, our multimodal hyper-networks demonstrated much
   better discriminative characteristics than either the conventional
   pairwise connectivity networks or the unimodal hyper-connectivity
   networks. Experimental results on publicly available ADNI dataset
   demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing single
   modality based sparse functional connectivity inference methods. (C)

Abstract = {Advancements in ultra-high field (7 T and higher) magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scanners have made it possible to investigate both the
   structure and function of the human brain at a sub-millimeter scale. As
   neuronal feedforward and feedback information arrives in different
   layers, sub-millimeter functional MRI has the potential to uncover
   information processing between cortical micro-circuits across cortical
   depth, i.e. laminar fMRI. For nearly all conventional fMRI analyses, the
   main assumption is that the relationship between local neuronal activity
   and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal adheres to the
   principles of linear systems theory. For laminar fMRI, however,
   directional blood pooling across cortical depth stemming from the
   anatomy of the cortical vasculature, potentially violates these linear
   system assumptions, thereby complicating analysis and interpretation.
   Here we assess whether the temporal additivity requirement of linear
   systems theory holds for laminar fMRI. We measured responses elicited by
   viewing stimuli presented for different durations and evaluated how well
   the responses to shorter durations predicted those elicited by longer
   durations. We find that BOLD response predictions are consistently good
   predictors for observed responses, across all cortical depths, and in
   all measured visual field maps (V1, V2, and V3). Our results suggest
   that the temporal additivity assumption for linear systems theory holds
   for laminar fMRI. We thus show that the temporal additivity assumption
   holds across cortical depth for sub-millimeter gradient-echo BOLD fMRI
   in early visual cortex.},

Abstract = {In resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), functional networks are
   assessed utilizing the temporal correlation between spontaneous blood
   oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuations of spatially remote brain
   regions. Recently, several groups have shown that temporal shifts are
   present in rs-fMRI maps in patients with cerebrovascular disease due to
   spatial differences in arterial arrival times, and that this can be
   exploited to map arrival times in the brain. This suggests that rs-fMRI
   connectivity mapping may be similarly sensitive to such temporal shifts,
   and that standard rs-fMRI analysis methods may fail to identify
   functional connectivity networks. To investigate this, we studied the
   default mode network (DMN) in Moyamoya disease patients and compared it
   with normal healthy volunteers. Our results show that using standard
   independent component analysis (ICA) and seed-based approaches, arterial
   arrival delays lead to inaccurate incomplete characterization of
   functional connectivity within the DMN in Moyamoya disease patients.
   Furthermore, we propose two techniques to correct these errors, for
   seed-based and ICA methods, respectively. Using these methods, we
   demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate the deleterious effects of
   arterial arrival time on the assessment of functional connectivity of
   the DMN. As these corrections have not been applied to the vast majority
   of >200 prior rs-fMRI studies in patients with cerebrovascular disease,
   we suggest that they be interpreted with great caution. Correction
   methods should be applied in any rs-fMRI connectivity study of subjects
   expected to have abnormally delayed arterial arrival times.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A recent study using task-based fMRI
   demonstrated that the middle frontal gyrus is comparable with Broca's
   area in its ability to determine language laterality using a measure of
   verbal fluency. This study investigated whether the middle frontal gyrus
   can be used as an indicator for language-hemispheric dominance in
   patients with brain tumors using task-free resting-state fMRI. We
   hypothesized that no significant difference in language lateralization
   would occur between the middle frontal gyrus and Broca area and that the
   middle frontal gyrus can serve as a simple and reliable means of
   measuring language laterality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using
   resting-state fMRI, we compared the middle frontal gyrus with the Broca
   area in 51 patients with glial neoplasms for voxel activation, the
   language laterality index, and the effect of tumor grade on the
   laterality index. The laterality index derived by resting-state fMRI and
   task-based fMRI was compared in a subset of 40 patients. RESULTS: Voxel
   activations in the left middle frontal gyrus and left Broca area were
   positively correlated (r = 0.47, P < .001). Positive correlations were
   seen between the laterality index of the Broca area and middle frontal
   gyrus regions (r = 0.56, P < .0005). Twenty-seven of 40 patients
   (67.5\%) showed concordance of the laterality index based on the Broca
   area using resting-state fMRI and the laterality index based on a
   language task. Thirty of 40 patients (75\%) showed concordance of the
   laterality index based on the middle frontal gyrus using resting-state
   fMRI and the laterality index based on a language task. CONCLUSIONS: The
   middle frontal gyrus is comparable with the Broca area in its ability to
   determine hemispheric dominance for language using resting-state fMRI.
   Our results suggest the addition of resting-state fMRI of the middle
   frontal gyrus to the list of noninvasive modalities that could be used
   in patients with gliomas to evaluate hemispheric dominance of language
   before tumor resection. In patients who cannot participate in
   traditional task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI offers a task-free
   alternate to presurgically map the eloquent cortex.},

Title = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging with independent
   component analysis for presurgical seizure onset zone localization: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis},

Abstract = {Objective One of the greatest challenges of achieving successful
   surgical outcomes in patients with epilepsy is the ability to properly
   localize the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Many techniques exist for
   localizing the SOZ, including intracranial electroencephalography,
   magnetoencephalography, and stereoelectroencephalography. Recently,
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in
   conjunction with independent component analysis (ICA) has been utilized
   for presurgical planning of SOZ resection, with varying results. In this
   meta-analysis, we analyze the current role of rs-fMRI in identifying the
   SOZ for presurgical planning for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
   Specifically, we seek to demonstrate its current effectiveness compared
   to other methods of SOZ localization. Methods A literature review was
   conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases up to May of
   2020. A total of 253 articles were screened, and seven studies were
   chosen for analysis. Each study was analyzed for SOZ localization by
   ground truth, SOZ localization by rs-fMRI with ICA, principal component
   analysis, or intrinsic connectivity contrast, and outcomes of surgery. A
   meta-analysis was performed to analyze how ground truth compares to
   rs-fMRI in SOZ localization. Results The odds ratio comparing ground
   truth to rs-fMRI was 2.63 (95\% confidence interval = 0.66-10.56).
   Average concordance of rs-fMRI SOZ localization compared with ground
   truth localization across studies was 71.3\%. Significance In the hunt
   for less invasive presurgical planning for epilepsy surgery, rs-fMRI
   with ICA provides a promising avenue for future standard practice. Our
   preliminary results show no significant difference in surgical outcomes
   between traditional standards of SOZ localization and rs-fMRI with ICA.
   We believe that rs-fMRI could be a step forward in this search. Further
   investigation comparing rs-fMRI to traditional methods of SOZ
   localization should be conducted, with the hope of moving toward relying
   solely on noninvasive screening methods.},

Title = {Pushing the Limits of EEG: Estimation of Large-Scale Functional Brain
   Networks and Their Dynamics Validated by Simultaneous fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the technique of choice
   for detecting large-scale functional brain networks and to investigate
   their dynamics. Because fMRI measures brain activity indirectly,
   electroencephalography (EEG) has been recently considered a feasible
   tool for detecting such networks, particularly the resting-state
   networks (RSNs). However, a truly unbiased validation of such claims is
   still missing, which can only be accomplished by using simultaneously
   acquired EEG and fMRI data, due to the spontaneous nature of the
   activity underlying the RSNs. Additionally, EEG is still poorly explored
   for the purpose of mapping task-specific networks, and no studies so far
   have been focused on investigating networks' dynamic functional
   connectivity (dFC) with EEG. Here, we started by validating RSNs derived
   from the continuous reconstruction of EEG sources by directly comparing
   them with those derived from simultaneous fMRI data of 10 healthy
   participants, and obtaining an average overlap (quantified by the Dice
   coefficient) of 0.4. We also showed the ability of EEG to map the facial
   expressions processing network (FEPN), highlighting regions near the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus, where the FEPN is anchored. Then, we
   measured the dFC using EEG for the first time in this context, estimated
   dFC brain states using dictionary learning, and compared such states
   with those obtained from the fMRI. We found a statistically significant
   match between fMRI and EEG dFC states, and determined the existence of
   two matched dFC states which contribution over time was associated with
   the brain activity at the FEPN, showing that the dynamics of FEPN can be
   captured by both fMRI and EEG. Our results push the limits of EEG toward
   being used as a brain imaging tool, while supporting the growing
   literature on EEG correlates of (dynamic) functional connectivity
   measured with fMRI, and providing novel insights into the coupling
   mechanisms underlying the two imaging techniques.},

Abstract = {Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) can be used in combination
   with functional MRI (fMRI) to study brain functions. This Consensus
   Statement provides a checklist for reporting concurrent tES-fMRI
   research.
   Low-intensity transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), including
   alternating or direct current stimulation, applies weak electrical
   stimulation to modulate the activity of brain circuits. Integration of
   tES with concurrent functional MRI (fMRI) allows for the mapping of
   neural activity during neuromodulation, supporting causal studies of
   both brain function and tES effects. Methodological aspects of tES-fMRI
   studies underpin the results, and reporting them in appropriate detail
   is required for reproducibility and interpretability. Despite the
   growing number of published reports, there are no consensus-based
   checklists for disclosing methodological details of concurrent tES-fMRI
   studies. The objective of this work was to develop a consensus-based
   checklist of reporting standards for concurrent tES-fMRI studies to
   support methodological rigor, transparency and reproducibility (ContES
   checklist). A two-phase Delphi consensus process was conducted by a
   steering committee (SC) of 13 members and 49 expert panelists through
   the International Network of the tES-fMRI Consortium. The process began
   with a circulation of a preliminary checklist of essential items and
   additional recommendations, developed by the SC on the basis of a
   systematic review of 57 concurrent tES-fMRI studies. Contributors were
   then invited to suggest revisions or additions to the initial checklist.
   After the revision phase, contributors rated the importance of the 17
   essential items and 42 additional recommendations in the final
   checklist. The state of methodological transparency within the 57
   reviewed concurrent tES-fMRI studies was then assessed by using the
   checklist. Experts refined the checklist through the revision and rating
   phases, leading to a checklist with three categories of essential items
   and additional recommendations: (i) technological factors, (ii) safety
   and noise tests and (iii) methodological factors. The level of reporting
   of checklist items varied among the 57 concurrent tES-fMRI papers,
   ranging from 24\% to 76\%. On average, 53\% of checklist items were
   reported in a given article. In conclusion, use of the ContES checklist
   is expected to enhance the methodological reporting quality of future
   concurrent tES-fMRI studies and increase methodological transparency and
   reproducibility.},

Title = {A robust deep neural network for denoising task-based fMRI data: An
   application to working memory and episodic memory},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to reduce the
   noise in task-based fMRI data without explicitly modeling noise. The DNN
   artificial neural network consists of one temporal convolutional layer,
   one long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, one time-distributed
   fully-connected layer, and one unconventional selection layer in
   sequential order. The LSTM layer takes not only the current time point
   but also what was perceived in a previous time point as its input to
   characterize the temporal autocorrelation of fMRI data. The
   fully-connected layer weights the output of the LSTM layer, and the
   output denoised fMRI time series is selected by the selection layer.
   Assuming that task-related neural response is limited to gray matter,
   the model parameters in the DNN network are optimized by maximizing the
   correlation difference between gray matter voxels and white matter or
   ventricular cerebrospinal fluid voxels. Instead of targeting a
   particular noise source, the proposed neural network takes advantage of
   the task design matrix to better extract task-related signal in fMRI
   data. The DNN network, along with other traditional denoising
   techniques, has been applied on simulated data, working memory task fMRI
   data acquired from a cohort of healthy subjects and episodic memory task
   fMRI data acquired from a small set of healthy elderly subjects.
   Qualitative and quantitative measurements were used to evaluate the
   performance of different denoising techniques. In the simulation, DNN
   improves fMRI activation detection and also adapts to varying
   hemodynamic response functions across different brain regions. DNN
   efficiently reduces physiological noise and generates more homogeneous
   task-response correlation maps in real data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Use of Functional MRI in Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Diseases:
   A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to modulate aberrant circuits
   associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) for decades and has shown
   robust therapeutic benefits. However, the mechanism of action of DBS
   remains incompletely understood. With technological advances, there is
   an emerging use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after
   DBS implantation to explore the effects of stimulation on brain networks
   in PD. This systematic review was designed following the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
   guidelines to summarize peer-reviewed articles published within the past
   10 years in which fMRI was employed on patients with PD-DBS. Search in
   PubMed database provided 353 references, and screenings resulted in a
   total of 19 studies for qualitative synthesis regarding study designs
   (fMRI scan timepoints and paradigm), methodology, and PD subtypes. This
   review concluded that fMRI may be used in patients with PD-DBS after
   proper safety test; resting-state and block-based fMRI designs have been
   employed to explore the effects of DBS on brain networks and the
   mechanism of action of the DBS, respectively. With further validation of
   safety use of fMRI and advances in imaging techniques, fMRI may play an
   increasingly important role in better understanding of the mechanism of
   stimulation as well as in improving clinical care to provide
   subject-specific neuromodulation treatments.},

Title = {The Benefit of Slice Timing Correction in Common fMRI Preprocessing
   Pipelines},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be
   acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from
   each other. To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines
   often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the
   benefits of STC is challenging because it (1) is dependent on slice
   acquisition parameters, (2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear
   fashion, and (3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps,
   fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently,
   the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been
   extensively examined. Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is
   applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction
   (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing.
   Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate
   that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on
   interleave parameters and motion level. We also demonstrate the benefit
   STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We
   conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that
   can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing. However, its
   effectiveness interacts with other preprocessing steps and with other
   scan parameters and conditions which may obscure its significant
   importance in the fMRI processing pipeline.},

Title = {A step-by-step tutorial on using the cognitive architecture ACT-R in
   combination with fMRI data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The cognitive architecture ACT-R is at the same time a psychological
   theory and a modeling framework for constructing cognitive models that
   adhere to the principles of the theory. ACT-R can be used in combination
   with fMRI data in two different ways: (1) fMRI data can be used to
   evaluate and constrain models in ACT-R by means of predefined
   Region-of-Interest (ROI) analysis, and (2) predictions from ACT-R models
   can be used to locate neural correlates of model processes and
   representations by means of model based fMRI analysis. In this paper we
   provide a step-by-step tutorial on both approaches. Note that this
   tutorial neither teaches the ACT-R theory in any detail, nor fMRI
   analysis, but explains how ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI
   data. To this end, we provide all data and computer code necessary to
   run the ACT-R model, carry out the analyses, and recreate the figures in
   the paper. As an example dataset we use a relatively simple algebra
   task. In the first section, we develop an ACT-R model of this task and
   fit it to behavioral data. In the second section, we apply a predefined
   ROI-analysis to evaluate the model using fMRI data. In the third
   section, we use model-based fMRI analysis to locate the following
   processes in the brain: retrieval of mathematical facts from memory,
   working memory updates, motor responses, and visually encoding the
   problems. After working through this tutorial, the reader will have
   learned what can be achieved with the two different analysis methods and
   how they are conducted; the example code can then be adapted to a new
   dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {No Evidence for Cross-Modal fMRI Adaptation in Macaque Parieto-Premotor
   Mirror Neuron Regions},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To probe the presence of mirror neurons in the human brain, cross-modal
   fMRI adaptation has been suggested as a suitable technique. The
   rationale behind this suggestion is that this technique allows making
   more accurate inferences about neural response properties underlying
   fMRI voxel activations, beyond merely showing shared voxels that are
   active during both action observation and execution. However, the
   validity of using cross-modal fMRI adaptation to demonstrate the
   presence of mirror neurons in parietal and premotor brain regions has
   been questioned given the inconsistent and weak results obtained in
   human studies. A better understanding of cross-modal fMRI adaptation
   effects in the macaque brain is required as the rationale for using this
   approach is based on several assumptions related to macaque mirror
   neuron response properties that still need validation. Here, we
   conducted a cross-modal fMRI adaptation study in macaque monkeys, using
   the same action execution and action observation tasks that successfully
   yielded mirror neuron region cross-modal action decoding in a previous
   monkey MVPA study. We scanned two male rhesus monkeys while they first
   executed a sequence of either reach-and-grasp or reach-and-touch hand
   actions and then observed a video of a human actor performing these
   motor acts. Both whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses failed to
   demonstrate cross-modal fMRI adaptation effects in parietal and premotor
   mirror neuron regions. Our results, in line with previous findings in
   non-human primates, show that cross-modal motor-to-visual fMRI
   adaptation is not easily detected in monkey brain regions known to house
   mirror neurons. Thus, our results advocate caution in using cross-modal
   fMRI adaptation as a method to infer whether mirror neurons can be found
   in the primate brain.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We established an optimal combination of EEG recording during sparse
   multiband (MB) fMRI that preserves high-resolution, whole-brain fMRI
   coverage while enabling broad-band EEG recordings which are uncorrupted
   by MRI gradient artefacts (GAs). We first determined the safety of
   simultaneous EEG recording during MB fMRI. Application of MB factor=4
   produced <1 degrees C peak heating of electrode/hardware during 20min of
   GE-EPI data acquisition. However, higher SAR sequences require specific
   safety testing, with greater heating observed using PCASL with MB
   factor=4. Heating was greatest in the electrocardiogram channel, likely
   due to it possessing longest lead length. We investigated the effect of
   MB factor on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio for a range of GE-EPI
   sequences (varying MB factor and temporal interval between slice
   acquisitions). We found that, for our experimental purpose, the optimal
   acquisition was achieved with MB factor=3, 3mm isotropic voxels, and 33
   slices providing whole head coverage. This sequence afforded a 2.25s
   duration quiet period (without GAs) in every 3s TR. Using this sequence,
   we demonstrated the ability to record gamma frequency (55-80Hz) EEG
   oscillations, in response to right index finger abduction, that are
   usually obscured by GAs during continuous fMRI data acquisition. In this
   novel application of EEG-MB fMRI to a motor task, we observed a positive
   correlation between gamma and BOLD responses in bilateral motor regions.
   These findings support and extend previous work regarding coupling
   between neural and hemodynamic measures of brain activity in humans and
   showcase the utility of EEG-MB fMRI for future investigations.},

Title = {Recovering task fMRI signals from highly under-sampled data with
   low-rank and temporal subspace constraints},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {97-110},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Recent developments in highly accelerated fMRI data acquisition have
   employed low-rank and/or sparsity constraints for image reconstruction,
   as an alternative to conventional, time-independent parallel imaging.
   When under-sampling factors are high or the signals of interest are
   low-variance, however, functional data recovery can be poor or
   incomplete. We introduce a method for improving reconstruction fidelity
   using external constraints, like an experimental design matrix, to
   partially orient the estimated fMRI temporal subspace. Combining these
   external constraints with low-rank constraints introduces a new image
   reconstruction model that is analogous to using a mixture of
   subspace-decomposition (PCA/ICA) and regression (GLM) models in fMRI
   analysis.
   We show that this approach improves fMRI reconstruction quality in
   simulations and experimental data, focusing on the model problem of
   detecting subtle 1-s latency shifts between brain regions in a
   block-design task-fMRI experiment. Successful latency discrimination is
   shown at acceleration factors up to R = 16 in a radial-Cartesian
   acquisition. We show that this approach works with approximate, or not
   perfectly informative constraints, where the derived benefit is
   commensurate with the information content contained in the constraints.
   The proposed method extends low-rank approximation methods for
   under-sampled fMRI data acquisition by leveraging knowledge of expected
   task-based variance in the data, enabling improvements in the speed and
   efficiency of fMRI data acquisition without the loss of subtle features.},

Title = {Feasibility of topological data analysis for event-related fMRI},
Journal = {NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {695-706},
Abstract = {Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations
   are instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain.
   However, the methods for detecting these representations are limited.
   Topological data analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the
   mathematical field of topology, that can detect unique types of
   geometric features in patterns of data. Several recent studies have
   successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural data; however,
   to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data from
   event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but
   limited in terms of the number of events that can be run within a
   practical time frame and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we
   investigate whether persistent homology-a popular TDA tool that
   identifies topological features in data and quantifies their
   robustness-can identify known signals given these constraints. We use
   fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of realistic fMRI data, to assess the
   plausibility of recovering a simple topological representation under a
   variety of conditions. Our results suggest that persistent homology can
   be used under certain circumstances to recover topological structure
   embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations. Author SummaryHow do we
   represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
   representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study
   these kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the
   organization of high-dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA)
   holds promise for detecting unique types of geometric features in
   patterns of data. Although potentially useful, TDA has not been applied
   to event-related fMRI data. Here we utilized a popular tool from TDA,
   persistent homology, to recover topological signals from event-related
   fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI data and explored the parameters
   under which persistent homology can successfully extract signal. We also
   provided extensive code and recommendations for how to make the most out
   of TDA for fMRI analysis.},

Abstract = {Patterns in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are widely used to characterize
   the trait effects of brain function. In this aspect, multiple rs-fMRI
   scans from single subjects can provide interesting clues about the
   rs-fMRI patterns, though scan-to-scan variability pose challenges.
   Therefore, rs-fMRI's are either concatenated or the functional
   connectivity is averaged. This leads to loss of information. Here, we
   use an alternative way to extract the rs-fMRI features that are common
   across all the scans by applying common-and-orthogonal-basis-extraction
   (COBE) technique. To address this, we employed rs-fMRI of 788 subjects
   from the human connectome project and estimated the
   common-COBE-component of each subject from the four rs-fMRI runs. Since
   the common-COBE-component is specific to a subject, the pattern was used
   to classify the subjects based on the similarity/dissimilarity of the
   features. The subset of subjects (n = 107) with
   maximal-COBE-dissimilarity (MCD) was extracted and the remaining
   subjects (n = 681) formed the COBE-similarity (CS) group. The
   distribution of weights of the common-COBE-component for the two groups
   across rs-fMRI networks and subcortical regions was evaluated. We found
   the weights in the default mode network to be lower in the MCD compared
   to the CS. We compared the scores of 69 behavioral measures and found
   six behaviors related to the use of marijuana, illicit drugs, alcohol,
   and tobacco; and including a measure of antisocial personality to
   differentiate the two groups. Gender differences were also significant.
   Altogether the findings suggested that subtypes exist even in healthy
   control population, and comparison studies (case vs. control) need to be
   mindful of it.},

Title = {Dynamic functional connectivity estimation for neurofeedback emotion
   regulation paradigm with simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Joint Analysis of EEG and fMRI datasets can bring new insight into brain
   mechanisms. In this paper, we employed the recently introduced
   Correlated Coupled Tensor Matrix Factorization (CCMTF) method for
   analysis of the emotion regulation paradigm based on EEG frontal
   asymmetry neurofeedback in the alpha frequency band with simultaneous
   fMRI. CCMTF method assumes that the co-variations of the common
   dimension (temporal dimension) between EEG and fMRI are correlated and
   not necessarily identical. The results of the CCMTF method suggested
   that EEG and fMRI had similar covariations during the transition of
   brain activities from resting states to task (view and upregulation)
   states and these covariations followed an increasing trend. The fMRI
   shared spatial component showed activations in the limbic system, DLPFC,
   OFC, and VLPC regions, which were consistent with the previous studies
   and were linked to EEG frequency patterns in the range of 1-15 Hz with a
   correlation value close to 0.75. The estimated regions from the CCMTF
   method were then used as the candidate nodes for dynamic functional
   connectivity (dFC) analysis, in which the changes in connectivity from
   view to upregulation states were examined. The results of the dFC
   analysis were compared with a Normalized Mutual information (NMI) based
   approach in two different frequency ranges (1-15 and 15-40 Hz) as the
   NMI method was applied to the vectors of dFC nodes of EEG and fMRI data.
   The results of the two methods illustrated that the relation between EEG
   and fMRI datasets was mostly in the frequency range of 1-15 Hz. These
   relations were both in the brain activations and the dFCs between the
   two modalities. This paper suggests that the CCMTF method is a capable
   approach for extracting the shared information between EEG and fMRI data
   and can reveal new information about brain functions and their
   connectivity without solving the EEG inverse problem or analyzing
   different frequency bands.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {264},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) allows the
   study of functional brain connectivity based on spatially structured
   variations in neuronal activity. Proper evaluation of connectivity
   requires removal of non-neural contributions to the fMRI signal, in
   particular hemodynamic changes associated with autonomic variability.
   Regression analysis based on autonomic indicator signals has been used
   for this purpose, but may be inadequate if neuronal and autonomic
   activities covary. To investigate this potential co-variation, we
   performed rsfMRI experiments while concurrently acquiring
   electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic indicator signals, including
   heart rate, respiratory depth, and peripheral vascular tone. We
   identified a recurrent and systematic spatiotemporal pattern of fMRI
   (named as fMRI cascade), which features brief signal reductions in
   salience and default-mode networks and the thalamus, followed by a
   biphasic global change with a sensory-motor dominance. This fMRI
   cascade, which was mostly observed during eyes-closed condition, was
   accompanied by large EEG and autonomic changes indicative of arousal
   modulations. Importantly, the removal of the fMRI cascade dynamics from
   rsfMRI diminished its correlations with various signals. These results
   suggest that the rsfMRI correlations with various physiological and
   neural signals are not independent but arise, at least partly, from the
   fMRI cascades and associated neural and physiological changes at arousal
   modulations.},

Abstract = {Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has long been used
   to assess task-related brain activity in neuropsychiatric disorders, it
   has not yet become a widely available clinical tool. Resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) has been the subject of recent attention in the fields of
   basic and clinical neuroimaging research. This method enables
   investigation of the functional organization of the brain and
   alterations of resting-state networks (RSNs) in patients with
   neuropsychiatric disorders. Rs-fMRI does not require participants to
   perform a demanding task, in contrast to task fMRI, which often requires
   participants to follow complex instructions. Rs-fMRI has a number of
   advantages over task fMRI for application with neuropsychiatric
   patients, for example, although applications of task fMR to participants
   for healthy are easy. However, it is difficult to apply these
   applications to patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders,
   because they may have difficulty in performing demanding cognitive task.
   Here, we review the basic methodology and analysis techniques relevant
   to clinical studies, and the clinical applications of the technique for
   examining neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on mood disorders (major
   depressive disorder and bipolar disorder) and dementia (Alzheimer's
   disease and mild cognitive impairment).},

Abstract = {MRI has potential as a translational approach from rodents to humans.
   However, given that mouse functional MRI (fMRI) uses anesthetics for
   suppression of motion, it has been difficult to directly compare the
   result of fMRI in ``unconsciousness{''} disease model mice with that in
   ``consciousness{''} patients. We develop awake fMRI to investigate brain
   function in 15q dup mice, a copy number variation model of autism.
   Compared to wild-type mice, we find that 15q dup is associated with
   whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity and diminished fMRI responses to
   odors of stranger mice. Ex vivo diffusion MRI reveals widespread
   anomalies in white matter ultrastructure in 15q dup mice, suggesting a
   putative anatomical substrate for these functional hypoconnectivity. We
   show that D-cycloserine (DCS) treatment partially normalizes these
   anormalies in the frontal cortex of 15q dup mice and rescues some social
   behaviors. Our results demonstrate the utility of awake rodent fMRI and
   provide a rationale for further investigation of DCS therapy.},

Title = {The relationship between EEG and fMRI connectomes is reproducible across
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies from 1.5T to 7T},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {231},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) are non-invasive methods that show complementary aspects
   of human brain activity. Despite measuring different proxies of brain
   activity, both the measured blood-oxygenation (fMRI) and
   neurophysiological recordings (EEG) are indirectly coupled. The
   electrophysiological and BOLD signal can map the underlying functional
   connectivity structure at the whole brain scale at different timescales.
   Previous work demonstrated a moderate but significant correlation
   between resting-state functional connectivity of both modalities,
   however there is a wide range of technical setups to measure
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI and the reliability of those measures between
   different setups remains unknown. This is true notably with respect to
   different magnetic field strengths (low and high field) and different
   spatial sampling of EEG (medium to high-density electrode coverage).
   Here, we investigated the reproducibility of the bimodal EEG-fMRI
   functional connectome in the most comprehensive resting-state
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset compiled to date including a total of 72
   subjects from four different imaging centers. Data was acquired from
   1.5T, 3T and 7T scanners with simultaneously recorded EEG using 64 or
   256 electrodes. We demonstrate that the whole-brain monomodal
   connectivity reproducibly correlates across different datasets and that
   a moderate crossmodal correlation between EEG and fMRI connectivity of r
   approximate to 0.3 can be reproducibly extracted in low- and high-field
   scanners. The crossmodal correlation was strongest in the EEG-beta.
   frequency band but exists across all frequency bands. Both homotopic and
   within intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) connections contributed the
   most to the crossmodal relationship. This study confirms, using a
   considerably diverse range of recording setups, that simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI offers a consistent estimate of multimodal functional
   connectomes in healthy subjects that are dominantly linked through a
   functional core of ICNs across spanning across the different timescales
   measured by EEG and fMRI. This opens new avenues for estimating the
   dynamics of brain function and provides a better understanding of
   interactions between EEG and fMRI measures. This observed level of
   reproducibility also defines a baseline for the study of alterations of
   this coupling in pathological conditions and their role as potential
   clinical markers.},

Title = {Optimising EEG-fMRI for Localisation of Focal Epilepsy in Children},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background
   Early surgical intervention in children with drug resistant epilepsy has
   benefits but requires using tolerable and minimally invasive tests.
   EEG-fMRI studies have demonstrated good sensitivity for the localization
   of epileptic focus but a poor yield although the reasons for this have
   not been systematically addressed. While adults EEG-fMRI studies are
   performed in the ``resting state{''}; children are commonly sedated
   however, this has associated risks and potential confounds. In this
   study, we assessed the impact of the following factors on the
   tolerability and results of EEG-fMRI in children: viewing a movie inside
   the scanner; movement; occurrence of interictal epileptiform discharges
   (IED); scan duration and design efficiency. This work's motivation is to
   optimize EEG-fMRI parameters to make this test widely available to
   paediatric population
   Methods
   Forty-six children with focal epilepsy and 20 controls (6-18) underwent
   EEG-fMRI. For two 10 minutes sessions subjects were told to lie still
   with eyes closed, as it is classically performed in adult studies
   ({''}rest sessions{''}), for another two sessions, subjects watched a
   child friendly stimulation i.e. movie ({''}movie sessions{''}). IED were
   mapped with EEG-fMRI for each session and across sessions. The resulting
   maps were classified as concordant/discordant with the presumed
   epileptogenic focus for each subject.
   Findings
   Movement increased with scan duration, but the movie reduced movement by
   similar to 40\% when played within the first 20 minutes. There was no
   effect of movie on the occurrence of IED, nor in the concordance of the
   test. Ability of EEG-fMRI to map the epileptogenic region was similar
   for the 20 and 40 minute scan durations. Design efficiency was
   predictive of concordance.
   Conclusions
   A child friendly natural stimulus improves the tolerability of EEG-fMRI
   and reduces in-scanner movement without having an effect on IED
   occurrence and quality of EEG-fMRI maps. This allowed us to scan
   children as young as 6 and obtain localising information without
   sedation. Our data suggest that similar to 20 minutes is the optimal
   length of scanning for EEG-fMRI studies in children with frequent IED.
   The efficiency of the fMRI design derived from spontaneous IED
   generation is an important factor for producing concordant results.},

Abstract = {The combination of non-invasive brain stimulation interventions with
   human brain mapping methods have supported research beyond correlational
   associations between brain activity and behavior. Functional MRI (fMRI)
   partnered with transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) methods, i.e.,
   transcranial direct current (tDCS), transcranial alternating current
   (tACS), and transcranial random noise (tRNS) stimulation, explore the
   neuro-modulatory effects of tES in the targeted brain regions and their
   interconnected networks and provide opportunities for individualized
   interventions. Advances in the field of tES-fMRI can be hampered by the
   methodological variability between studies that confounds
   comparability/replicability. In order to explore variability in the
   tES-fMRI methodological parameter space (MPS), we conducted a systematic
   review of 222 tES-fMRI experiments (181 tDCS, 39 tACS and 2 tRNS)
   published before February 1, 2019, and suggested a framework to
   systematically report main elements of MPS across studies. Publications
   dedicated to tRNS-fMRI were not considered in this systematic review. We
   have organized main findings in terms of fMRI modulation by tES. tES
   modulates activation and connectivity beyond the stimulated areas
   particularly with prefrontal stimulation. There were no two studies with
   the same MPS to replicate findings. We discuss how to harmonize the MPS
   to promote replication in future studies.},

Abstract = {Blind source separation (BSS) is commonly used in functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. Recently, BSS models based on
   restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), one of the building blocks of deep
   learning models, have been shown to improve brain network identification
   compared to conventional single matrix factorization models such as
   independent component analysis (ICA). These models, however, trained RBM
   on fMRI volumes, and are hence challenged by model complexity and
   limited training set. In this article, we propose to apply RBM to fMRI
   time courses instead of volumes for BSS. The proposed method not only
   interprets fMRI time courses explicitly to take advantages of deep
   learning models in latent feature learning but also substantially
   reduces model complexity and increases the scale of training set to
   improve training efficiency. Our experimental results based on Human
   Connectome Project (HCP) datasets demonstrated the superiority of the
   proposed method over ICA and the one that applied RBM to fMRI volumes in
   identifying task-related components, resulted in more accurate and
   specific representations of task-related activations. Moreover, our
   method separated out components representing intermixed effects between
   task events, which could reflect inherent interactions among
   functionally connected brain regions. Our study demonstrates the value
   of RBM in mining complex structures embedded in large-scale fMRI data
   and its potential as a building block for deeper models in fMRI data
   analysis.},

Abstract = {IntroductionDecoding brain activities is one of the most popular topics
   in neuroscience in recent years. And deep learning has shown high
   performance in fMRI data classification and regression, but its
   requirement for large amounts of data conflicts with the high cost of
   acquiring fMRI data. MethodsIn this study, we propose an end-to-end
   temporal contrastive self-supervised learning algorithm, which learns
   internal spatiotemporal patterns within fMRI and allows the model to
   transfer learning to datasets of small size. For a given fMRI signal, we
   segmented it into three sections: the beginning, middle, and end. We
   then utilized contrastive learning by taking the end-middle (i.e.,
   neighboring) pair as the positive pair, and the beginning-end (i.e.,
   distant) pair as the negative pair. ResultsWe pretrained the model on 5
   out of 7 tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and applied it in
   a downstream classification of the remaining two tasks. The pretrained
   model converged on data from 12 subjects, while a randomly initialized
   model required 100 subjects. We then transferred the pretrained model to
   a dataset containing unpreprocessed whole-brain fMRI from 30
   participants, achieving an accuracy of 80.2 \& PLUSMN; 4.7\%, while the
   randomly initialized model failed to converge. We further validated the
   model's performance on the Multiple Domain Task Dataset (MDTB), which
   contains fMRI data of 26 tasks from 24 participants. Thirteen tasks of
   fMRI were selected as inputs, and the results showed that the
   pre-trained model succeeded in classifying 11 of the 13 tasks. When
   using the 7 brain networks as input, variations of the performance were
   observed, with the visual network performed as well as whole brain
   inputs, while the limbic network almost failed in all 13 tasks.
   DiscussionOur results demonstrated the potential of self-supervised
   learning for fMRI analysis with small datasets and unpreprocessed data,
   and for analysis of the correlation between regional fMRI activity and
   cognitive tasks.},

Title = {(R)- and (S)-ketamine induce differential fMRI responses in conscious
   rats},
Journal = {SYNAPSE},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {(R,S)-ketamine exerts robust antidepressant effects in patients with
   depression when given at sub-anesthetic doses. Each of the enantiomers
   in this racemic mixture, (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine, have been
   reported to exert antidepressant effects individually. However, the
   neuropharmacological effects of these enantiomers and the mechanisms
   underlying their antidepressive actions have not yet been fully
   elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effect of (R,S)-, (R)-, and
   (S)-ketamine on brain activity by functional MRI (fMRI) in conscious
   rats and compared these with that of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
   (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 (n = 5 similar to 7). We also assessed their
   pharmacokinetic profiles (n = 4) and their behavioral effects (n = 7
   similar to 9). This pharmacological MRI study revealed a significant
   positive response to (S)-ketamine specifically in the cortex, nucleus
   accumbens and striatum. In contrast, negative fMRI responses were
   observed in various brain regions after (R)-ketamine administration.
   (R,S)-ketamine, evoked significant positive fMRI responses specifically
   in the cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum, and this fMRI response
   pattern was comparable with that of (S)-ketamine. MK-801-induced similar
   fMRI response pattern to (S)-ketamine. The fMRI responses to
   (S)-ketamine and MK-801 showed differential temporal profiles, which
   corresponded with brain concentration profiles. (S)-ketamine and MK-801
   significantly increased locomotor activity, while (R)-ketamine produced
   no noticeable change. (R,S)-ketamine tended to increase locomotor
   activity. Our novel fMRI findings show that (R)-ketamine and
   (S)-ketamine induce completely different fMRI response patterns on rat,
   and that the response produced by the latter is similar to that elicited
   by an NMDAR antagonist. Our findings provide insight into the
   antidepressant mechanism of (R,S)-ketamine.},

Title = {Test-retest repeatability of patterns of brain activation provoked by
   bladder filling},
Journal = {NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {1472-1478},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo assess short-term repeatability of an fMRI protocol widely
   used to assess brain control of the bladder. fMRI offers the potential
   to discern incontinence phenotypes as well as the mechanisms mediating
   therapeutic response. If so, this could enable more targeted efforts to
   enhance therapy. Such data, however, require excellent test-retest
   repeatability.
   MethodsFifty-nine older women (age 60 years) with urgency incontinence
   underwent two fMRI scans within 5-10min with a concurrent bladder
   infusion/withdrawal protocol. Activity in three brain regions relevant
   to bladder control was compared using paired t tests and intra-class
   correlation.
   ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences in brain
   activity between the two consecutive scans in the regions of interest.
   Intra-class correlation was 0.19 in the right insula, 0.32 in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, and 0.44 in the
   medial pre-frontal cortex. Such correlations are considered fair or
   poor, but are comparable to those from studies of other repeated fMRI
   tasks.
   ConclusionsThis is the first evaluation of the repeatability of a
   bladder fMRI protocol. The technique used provides a framework for
   comparing different fMRI protocols applied to brain-bladder research.
   Despite universal patient response to the stimulus, brain response had
   limited repeatability within individuals. Improvement of the
   investigational protocol should magnify brain response and reduce
   variability. These results suggest that although analysis of fMRI data
   among groups of subjects yields valuable insight into bladder control,
   fMRI is not yet appropriate for evaluation of the brain's role in
   continence on an individual level.},

Abstract = {Direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA) by functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) could be a revolutionary approach for advancing
   systems neuroscience research. To independently replicate this
   observation, we performed fMRI experiments in anesthetized mice. The
   blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response to whisker stimulation
   was reliably detected in the primary barrel cortex before and after
   DIANA experiments; however, no DIANA-like fMRI peak was observed in
   individual animals' data with the 50 to 300 trials. Extensively averaged
   data involving 1050 trials in six mice showed a flat baseline and no
   detectable neuronal activity-like fMRI peak. However, spurious,
   nonreplicable peaks were found when using a small number of trials, and
   artifactual peaks were detected when some outlier-like trials were
   excluded. Further, no detectable DIANA peak was observed in the
   BOLD-responding thalamus from the selected trials with the neuronal
   activity-like reference function in the barrel cortex. Thus, we were
   unable to replicate the previously reported results without data
   preselection.},

Abstract = {Resting-state fMRI was first described by Biswal et al in 1995 and has
   since then been widely used in both healthy subjects and patients with
   various neurologic, neurosurgical, and psychiatric disorders. As opposed
   to paradigm- or task-based functional MR imaging, resting-state fMRI
   does not require subjects to perform any specific task. The
   low-frequency oscillations of the resting-state fMRI signal have been
   shown to relate to the spontaneous neural activity. There are many ways
   to analyze resting-state fMRI data. In this review article, we will
   briefly describe a few of these and highlight the advantages and
   limitations of each. This description is to facilitate the adoption and
   use of resting-state fMRI in the clinical setting, helping
   neuroradiologists become familiar with these techniques and applying
   them for the care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric diseases.},

Title = {Indication of dynamic neurovascular coupling from inconsistency between
   EEG and fMRI indices across sleep-wake states},

Abstract = {Neurovascular coupling (NVC), the transient regional hyperemia following
   the evoked neuronal responses, is the basis of blood oxygenation
   level-dependent techniques and is generally adopted across physiological
   conditions, including the intrinsic resting state. However, the
   possibility of neurovascular dissociations across physiological
   alterations is indicated in the literature. To examine the NVC stability
   across sleep-wake states, we used electroencephalography (EEG) as the
   index of neural activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) as the measure of cerebrovascular response. Eight healthy adults
   were recruited for simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings in nocturnal sleep.
   We compared the cross-modality (EEG vs. fMRI) consistency of functional
   indices (spectral amplitude and functional connectivity) among five
   states of wakefulness and sleep (state effect). We also segregated the
   brain into three main partitions (anterior, middle and posterior) for
   spatial assessments (regional effect). Significant state effects were
   found on delta, alpha and fMRI indices and regional effects on the alpha
   and fMRI indices. However, the cross-state EEG changes in spectral
   amplitude and functional connectivity did not consistently match the
   changes in the fMRI indices across sleep-wake states. In spectral
   amplitude, the delta band peaked at the N3 stage for all brain regions,
   while the fMRI fluctuation amplitude peaked at the N2 stage in the
   central and posterior regions. In regional connectivity, the
   inter-hemispheric connectivity of the delta band peaked at the N3 stage
   for all regions, but the bilateral fMRI connectivity showed the state
   changes in the anterior and central regions. The cross-modality
   inconsistencies across sleep-wake states provided preliminary evidence
   that the neurovascular relationship may not change in a linear
   consistency during NREM sleep. Thus, caution shall be exercised when
   applying the NVC presumption to investigating sleep/wake transitions,
   even among healthy young adults.},

Title = {Brain compensation during visuospatial working memory in premanifest
   Huntington's disease},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {136},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant disorder
   characterised by impairment of movement, cognitive decline and
   psychiatric impairment. During the premanifest stages of HD (pre-HD),
   there are notable structural and functional brain changes detectable
   many decades prior to clinical diagnosis. Although caudate atrophy is
   one of the earliest and most prominent sites of neuropathology, there is
   also evidence of cortical atrophy, compromised white and grey matter
   integrity, cortical hypometabolism, and aberrant task-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. Pre-HD individuals typically
   show increased task-related fMRI activity suggested as a strategy to
   compensate for early brain anomalies. In this study, we used a
   quantitative model of compensation, known as the CRUNCH
   (Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis), to
   explicitly characterise compensation in pre-HD. The assumption of the
   model is that fMRI activity increases as task difficulty increases
   (compensatory effect). However, when individuals reach the `CRUNCH'
   point, where task difficulty exceeds their neural resources, fMRI
   activity and performance declines. We acquired fMRI data (n =15 pre-HD;
   n =15 controls) during performance of an fMRI visuospatial working
   memory task with low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high memory
   loads. Consistent with the CRUNCH prediction, pre-HD individuals showed
   decreased fMRI activity in left intraparietal sulcus at high memory
   load, compared to healthy controls who showed increased fMRI activity in
   left intraparietal sulcus at high memory load. Contrary to the other
   CRUNCH prediction, the pre-HD group did not show compensatory increase
   in fMRI activity at lower levels of memory loads in left intraparietal
   sulcus. Our findings provide partial support for the validity of CRUNCH
   in pre-HD.},

Title = {Population receptive fields in nonhuman primates from whole-brain fMRI
   and large-scale neurophysiology in visual cortex},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Population receptive field (pRF) modeling is a popular fMRI method to
   map the retinotopic organization of the human brain. While fMRI-based
   pRF maps are qualitatively similar to invasively recorded single-cell
   receptive fields in animals, it remains unclear what neuronal signal
   they represent. We addressed this question in awake nonhuman primates
   comparing whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiological recordings
   in areas V1 and V4 of the visual cortex. We examined the fits of several
   pRF models based on the fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal,
   multi-unit spiking activity (MUA), and local field potential (LFP) power
   in different frequency bands. We found that pRFs derived from BOLD-fMRI
   were most similar to MUA-pRFs in V1 and V4, while pRFs based on LFP
   gamma power also gave a good approximation. fMRI-based pRFs thus
   reliably reflect neuronal receptive field properties in the primate
   brain. In addition to our results in V1 and V4, the whole-brain fMRI
   measurements revealed retinotopic tuning in many other cortical and
   subcortical areas with a consistent increase in pRF size with increasing
   eccentricity, as well as a retinotopically specific deactivation of
   default mode network nodes similar to previous observations in humans.},

Title = {A line through the brain: implementation of human line-scanning at 7T

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used tool in
   neuroscience to detect neurally evoked responses, e.g. the blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Typically, BOLD fMRI has
   millimeter spatial resolution and temporal resolution of one to few
   seconds. To study the sub-millimeter structures and activity of the
   cortical gray matter, the field needs an fMRI method with high spatial
   and temporal resolution. Line-scanning fMRI achieves very high spatial
   resolution and high sampling rate, at the cost of a sacrifice in volume
   coverage. Here, we present a human line-scanning implementation on a 7T
   MRI system. First, we investigate the quality of the saturation pulses
   that suppress MR signal outside the line. Second, we established the
   best coil combination for reconstruction. Finally, we applied the
   line-scanning method in the occipital lobe during a visual stimulation
   task, showing BOLD responses along cortical depth, every 250 mu m with a
   200 ms repetition time (TR). We found a good correspondence of
   t-statistics values with 2D gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GE-EPI)
   BOLD fMRI data with the same temporal resolution and voxel volume (R =
   0.6 +/- 0.2). In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of
   line-scanning in humans and this opens line-scanning fMRI for
   applications in cognitive and clinical neuroscience.},

Title = {Neurovascular Uncoupling in Resting State fMRI Demonstrated in Patients
   With Primary Brain Gliomas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {620-626},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: To demonstrate that the problem of brain tumor-related
   neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) is a significant issue with respect to
   resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI
   (rsfMRI) similar to task-based BOLD fMRI, in which signal detectability
   can be compromised by breakdown of normal neurovascular coupling.
   Methods: We evaluated seven de novo brain tumor patients who underwent
   resting state fMRI as part of comprehensive clinical fMRI exams at 3
   Tesla. For each of the seven patients who demonstrated evidence of NVU
   on task-based motor fMRI, we performed both an independent component
   analysis (ICA) and an atlas-based parcellation-based seed correlation
   analysis (SCA) of the resting state fMRI data. For each patient,
   ipsilesional (IL) and contralesional (CL) regions of interest (ROIs)
   comprising primary motor and somatosensory cortices were used to
   evaluate BOLD signal changes on Z score maps derived from both ICA and
   SCA analysis for evidence of NVU. A subsequent two-tailed t-test was
   performed to determine whether statistically significant differences
   between the two sides were present that were consistent with NVU.
   Results: In seven patients, overall decreased BOLD signal (based on
   suprathreshold voxels in ICA and SCA-derived Z-score maps) was noted in
   IL compared with CL ROIs (P<0.01), consistent with NVU.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NVU can result in false negative
   BOLD signal changes on rsfMRI comparable to previously published
   findings on standard motor task-based fMRI.},

Title = {Hemispheric asymmetries in resting-state EEG and fMRI are related to
   approach and avoidance behaviour, but not to eating behaviour or BMI},
Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1136-1152},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Much of our behaviour is driven by two motivational dimensions-approach
   and avoidance. These have been related to frontal hemispheric
   asymmetries in clinical and resting-state EEG studies: Approach was
   linked to higher activity of the left relative to the right hemisphere,
   while avoidance was related to the opposite pattern. Increased approach
   behaviour, specifically towards unhealthy foods, is also observed in
   obesity and has been linked to asymmetry in the framework of the
   right-brain hypothesis of obesity. Here, we aimed to replicate previous
   EEG findings of hemispheric asymmetries for self-reported
   approach/avoidance behaviour and to relate them to eating behaviour.
   Further, we assessed whether resting fMRI hemispheric asymmetries can be
   detected and whether they are related to approach/avoidance, eating
   behaviour and BMI. We analysed three samples: Sample 1 (n = 117)
   containing EEG and fMRI data from lean participants, and Samples 2 (n =
   89) and 3 (n = 152) containing fMRI data from lean, overweight and obese
   participants. In Sample 1, approach behaviour in women was related to
   EEG, but not to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. In Sample 2,
   approach/avoidance behaviours were related to fMRI hemispheric
   asymmetries. Finally, hemispheric asymmetries were not related to either
   BMI or eating behaviour in any of the samples. Our study partly
   replicates previous EEG findings regarding hemispheric asymmetries and
   indicates that this relationship could also be captured using fMRI. Our
   findings suggest that eating behaviour and obesity are likely to be
   mediated by mechanisms not directly relating to frontal asymmetries in
   neuronal activation quantified with EEG and fMRI.},

Title = {Relationship between fMRI response during a nonverbal memory task and
   marijuana use in college students},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {188},
Pages = {71-78},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Marijuana (MJ) is widely used among college students, with peak use
   between ages 18-22. Research suggests memory dysfunction in adolescent
   and young adult MJ users, but the neural correlates are unclear. We
   examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response during a
   memory task among college students with varying degrees of MJ
   involvement.
   Participants were 64 college students, ages 18-20, who performed a
   visual encoding and recognition task during fMRI. MJ use was ascertained
   for 3 months prior to scanning; 27 individuals reported past 3-month MJ
   use, and 33 individuals did not. fMRI response was modeled during
   encoding based on whether targets were subsequently recognized (correct
   encoding), and during recognition based on target identification (hits).
   fMRI response in left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
   hippocampal regions of interest was examined between MJ users and
   controls.
   There were no group differences between MJ users and controls on fMRI
   response during encoding, although single sample t-tests revealed that
   MJ users failed to activate the hippocampus. During recognition, MJ
   users showed less fMRI response than controls in right hippocampus
   (Cohen's d = 0.55), left hippocampus (Cohen's d = 0.67) and left IFG
   (Cohen's d = 0.61). Heavier MJ involvement was associated with lower
   fMRI response in left hippocampus and left IFG.
   This study provides evidence of MJ-related prefrontal and hippocampal
   dysfunction during recognition memory in college students. These
   findings may contribute to our previously identified decrements in
   academic performance in college MJ users and could have substantial
   implications for academic and occupational functioning.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Clinically diagnosed partial epilepsy is hard to be
   functionally diagnosed by regular electroencephalograph (EEG) and
   conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By collecting transient
   brain regional signals, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
   function MRI (BOLD-fMRI) can provide brain function change information
   with high accuracy. By using resting state BOLD-fMRI technique, we aim
   to investigate the changes of brain function in partial epilepsy
   patients.
   Methods: BOLD-fMRI scanning was performed in 70 partial epilepsy and 70
   healthy people. BOLD-fMRI data was analyzed by using the Regional
   Homogeneity (ReHo) method and functional connectivity of Default Mode
   Network (DMN) methods. The abnormal brain functional connectivity in
   partial epilepsy patients was detected by Statistical Parametric Mapping
   8 (SPM8) analysis.
   Results: Compared to healthy group, epilepsy patients showed significant
   decreased ReHo in left inferior parietal lobule/pre- and post-central
   gyrus, right thalamus/paracentral lobule/Cerebellum anterior and
   posterior Lobe, bilateral insula. The DMN functional connectivity
   regions decreased significantly in right uncus, left Inferior parietal
   lobule, left supramarginal gyrus, left uncus, left parahippocampa gyrus,
   and left superior temporal gyrus, in epilepsy patients, compared to
   healthy controls.
   Significance: This study clarified that both ReHo and functional
   connectivity of DMN decreased in partial epilepsy patients compared to
   healthy controls. While left inferior parietal lobule was detected in
   both ReHo and DMN, many other identified regions were different by using
   these two BOLD-fMRI techniques. We propose that both ReHo and DMN
   patterns in BOLD-fMRI may suggest networks responsible for partial
   epilepsy genesis or progression.},

Abstract = {Background: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a valuable tool in the clinic as it
   provides excellent temporal and spatial information about normal and
   diseased brain function. In pre-clinical research with small rodents,
   obtaining simultaneous EEG-fMRI in longitudinal studies faces a number
   of challenges, including issues related to magnetic susceptibility
   artifacts.
   New method: Here, we demonstrate a method for permanent MRI RF-coil and
   EEG electrode implantation in rats that is suitable for long-term
   chronic follow-up studies in both stimulus and resting-state fMRI
   paradigms.
   Results: Our findings showed that the screw-free implantation method is
   well suited for long-term followup studies in both freely moving
   video-EEG settings and fMRI without causing MRI susceptibility
   artifacts. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that a multimodal
   approach can be used to track the progression of structural and
   functional changes.
   Comparison with existing methods: The quality of both MRI and EEG data
   were comparable to those obtained with traditional methods with the
   benefit of combining them into artifact-free simultaneous recordings.
   The signal-to-noise ratios of the MRI images obtained with the implanted
   RF-coil were similar to those using a quadrature coil and were therefore
   suitable for resting-state fMRI experiments. Similarly, EEG data
   collected with the RF-coil/electrode set-up were comparable to EEG
   recorded with traditional epidural screw electrodes.
   Conclusion: This new multimodal EEG-fMRI approach provides a novel tool
   for concomitant analysis and follow-up of anatomic and functional MRI,
   as well as electrographic changes in a preclinical research. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Context: The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the
   evaluation of children's brains is becoming increasingly popular.
   However, due to the high number of publications, it's nearly impossible
   to read all the related articles and become aware of the crucial
   elements or the best approach to invest time and effort in this field.
   Objectives: Our goal was to gain a better overall understanding of fMRI
   publications and to use this information in policy and management
   contexts to make more efficient decisions.
   Methods: Data were downloaded from Scopus from the 1990s to the end of
   2021 based on the theme of fMRI in pediatrics. The retrieved research
   articles were analyzed with the Bibliometrix package in R software.
   Results: From 8,544 documents written by 25,697 authors, the USA is by
   far the most productive country with a total of 3,609 publications.
   However, regarding the average article citations, Sweden is at the top
   of the list, with 77.79 average citations. Important themes include
   emotion, autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorders, and childhood maltreatment.
   Conclusions: The results of the present study on fMRI research in the
   field of pediatrics will be helpful for professionals to visually
   understand the pediatric modes and trends in fMRI.},

Title = {A critical assessment of data quality and venous effects in
   sub-millimeter fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {189},
Pages = {847-869},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Advances in hardware, pulse sequences, and reconstruction techniques
   have made it possible to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) at sub-millimeter resolution while maintaining high spatial
   coverage and acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we examine whether
   sub-millimeter fMRI can be used as a routine method for obtaining
   accurate measurements of fine-scale local neural activity. We conducted
   fMRI in human visual cortex during a simple event-related visual
   experiment (7T, gradient-echo EPI, 0.8-mm isotropic voxels, 2.2-s
   sampling rate, 84 slices), and developed analysis and visualization
   tools to assess the quality of the data. Our results fall along three
   lines of inquiry. First, we find that the acquired fMRI images, combined
   with appropriate surface-based processing, provide reliable and accurate
   measurements of fine-scale blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   activity patterns. Second, we show that the highly folded structure of
   cortex causes substantial biases on spatial resolution and data
   visualization. Third, we examine the well-recognized issue of venous
   contributions to fMRI signals. In a systematic assessment of large
   sections of cortex measured at a fine scale, we show that time-averaged
   T-2{*}-weighted EPI intensity is a simple, robust marker of venous
   effects. These venous effects are unevenly distributed across cortex,
   are more pronounced in gyri and outer cortical depths, and are, to a
   certain degree, in consistent locations across subjects relative to
   cortical folding. Furthermore, we show that these venous effects are
   strongly correlated with BOLD responses evoked by the experiment. We
   conclude that sub-millimeter fMRI can provide robust information about
   fine-scale BOLD activity patterns, but special care must be exercised in
   visualizing and interpreting these patterns, especially with regards to
   the confounding influence of the brain's vasculature. To help translate
   these methodological findings to neuroscience research, we provide
   practical suggestions for both high-resolution and standard-resolution
   fMRI studies.},

Title = {Optimizing Within-Subject Experimental Designs for jICA of Multi-Channel
   ERP and fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {Joint independent component analysis (jICA) can be applied within
   subject for fusion of multi-channel event-related potentials (ERP) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to measure brain function
   at high spatiotemporal resolution (Mangalathu-Arumana et al., 2012).
   However, the impact of experimental design choices on jICA performance
   has not been systematically studied. Here, the sensitivity of jICA for
   recovering neural sources in individual data was evaluated as a function
   of imaging SNR, number of independent representations of the ERP/fMRI
   data, relationship between instantiations of the joint ERP/fMRI activity
   (linear, non-linear, uncoupled), and type of sources (varying
   parametrically and non-parametrically across representations of the
   data), using computer simulations. Neural sources were simulated with
   spatiotemporal and noise attributes derived from experimental data. The
   best performance, maximizing both cross-modal data fusion and the
   separation of brain sources, occurred with a moderate number of
   representations of the ERP/fMRI data (10-30), as in a mixed block/event
   related experimental design. Importantly, the type of relationship
   between instantiations of the ERP/fMRI activity, whether linear,
   non-linear or uncoupled, did not in itself impact jICA performance, and
   was accurately recovered in the common profiles (i.e., mixing
   coefficients). Thus, jICA provides an unbiased way to characterize the
   relationship between ERP and fMRI activity across brain regions, in
   individual data, rendering it potentially useful for characterizing
   pathological conditions in which neurovascular coupling is adversely
   affected.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of
   functional MRI (fMRI) in determining lateralization and predicting
   postsurgical language and memory outcomes.
   Methods: An 11-member panel evaluated and rated available evidence
   according to the 2004 American Academy of Neurology process. At least 2
   panelists reviewed the full text of 172 articles and selected 37 for
   data extraction. Case reports, reports with,15 cases, metaanalyses, and
   editorials were excluded.
   Results and recommendations: The use of fMRI may be considered an option
   for lateralizing language functions in place of intracarotid amobarbital
   procedure (IAP) in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE;
   Level C), temporal epilepsy in general (Level C), or extratemporal
   epilepsy (Level C). For patients with temporal neocortical epilepsy or
   temporal tumors, the evidence is insufficient (Level U). fMRI may be
   considered to predict postsurgical language deficits after anterior
   temporal lobe resection (Level C). The use of fMRI may be considered for
   lateralizing memory functions in place of IAP in patients with MTLE
   (Level C) but is of unclear utility in other epilepsy types (Level U).
   fMRI of verbal memory or language encoding should be considered for
   predicting verbal memory outcome (Level B). fMRI using nonverbal memory
   encoding may be considered for predicting visuospatial memory outcomes
   (Level C). Presurgical fMRI could be an adequate alternative to IAP
   memory testing for predicting verbal memory outcome (Level C).
   Clinicians should carefully advise patients of the risks and benefits of
   fMRI vs IAP during discussions concerning choice of specific modality in
   each case.},

Title = {Examining resting-state functional connectivity in first-episode
   schizophrenia with 7T fMRI and MEG},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Abstract = {Schizophrenia is often characterized by dysconnections in the brain,
   which can be estimated via functional connectivity analyses. Commonly
   measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in order to characterize the intrinsic or baseline function of
   the brain, fMRI functional connectivity has significantly contributed to
   the understanding of schizophrenia. However, these measures may not
   capture the full extent of functional connectivity abnormalities in
   schizophrenia as fMRI is temporally limited by the hemodynamic response.
   In order to extend fMRI functional connectivity findings, the
   complementary modally of magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be utilized to
   capture electrophysiological functional connectivity abnormalities in
   schizophrenia that are not obtainable with fMRI. Therefore, we
   implemented a multimodal functional connectivity analysis using
   resting-state 7 Tesla fMRI and MEG data in a sample of first-episode
   patients with schizophrenia (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 24). fMRI
   and MEG data were decomposed into components reflecting resting state
   networks using a group spatial independent component analysis.
   Functional connectivity between resting-state networks was computed and
   group differences were observed. In fMRI, patients demonstrated
   hyperconnectivity between subcortical and auditory networks, as well as
   hypoconnectivity between interhemispheric homotopic sensorimotor network
   components. In MEG, patients demonstrated hypoconnectivity between
   sensorimotor and task positive networks in the delta frequency band.
   Results not only support the dysconnectivity hypothesis of
   schizophrenia, but also suggest the importance of jointly examining
   multimodal neuroimaging data as critical disorder-related information
   may not be detectable in a single modally alone.},

Title = {Is hunger important to model in fMRI visual food-cue reactivity
   paradigms in adults with obesity and how should this be done?},
Journal = {APPETITE},

Volume = {120},
Pages = {388-397},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {We considered 1) influence of self-reported hunger in behavioral and
   fMRI food-cue reactivity (fMRIFCR) 2) optimal methods to model this.
   Adults (N = 32; 19-60 years; F = 21; BMI 30-39.9 kg/m(2)) participated
   in an fMRI-FCR task that required rating 240 images of food and matched
   objects for `appeal'. Hunger, satiety, thirst, fullness and emptiness
   were measured pre- and post-scan (visual analogue scales). Hunger,
   satiety, fullness and emptiness were combined to form a latent factor
   (appetite). Post-vs. pre-scores were compared using paired t-tests. In
   mixed-effects models, appeal/fMRI-FCR responses were regressed on image
   (i.e. food/ objects), with random intercepts and slopes of image for
   functional runs nested within subjects. Each of hunger, satiety, thirst,
   fullness, emptiness and appetite were added as covariates in 4 forms
   (separate models): 1) change; 2) post- and pre-mean; 3) pre-; 4) change
   and pre-.
   Satiety decreased (Delta = 13.39, p = 0.001) and thirst increased (Delta
   = 11.78, p = 0.006) during the scan. Changes in other constructs were
   not significant (p's > 0.05). Including covariates did not influence
   food vs. object contrast of appeal ratings/fMRI-FCR. Significant image X
   covariate interactions were observed in some fMRI models. However,
   including these constructs did not improve the overall model fit.
   While some subjective, self-reported hunger, satiety and related
   constructs may be moderating fMRIFCR, these constructs do not appear to
   be salient influences on appeal/fMRI-FCR in people with obesity
   undergoing fMRI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predictive value of functional MRI and EEG in epilepsy diagnosis after a
   first seizure},
Journal = {EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is often difficult to predict seizure recurrence in subjects who have
   suffered a first-ever epileptic seizure. In this study, the predictive
   value of physiological signals measured using Electroencephalography
   (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) is assessed. In particular those
   patients developing epilepsy (i.e. a second unprovoked seizure) that
   were initially evaluated as having a low risk of seizure recurrence are
   of interest.
   In total, 26 epilepsy patients, of which 8 were initially evaluated as
   having a low risk of seizure recurrence (i.e. converters), and 17
   subjects with only a single seizure were included. All subjects
   underwent routine EEG as well as fMRI measurements. For diagnostic
   classification, features related to the temporal dynamics were
   determined for both the processed EEG and fMRI data. Subsequently, a
   logistic regression classifier was trained on epilepsy and first-seizure
   subjects. The trained model was tested using the clinically relevant
   converters group.
   The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (mean +/- SD) of the regression
   model including metrics from both modalities were 74 +/- 19\%, 82 +/-
   18\%, and 0.75 +/- 0.12, respectively. Positive and negative predictive
   values (mean SD) of the regression model with both EEG and fMRI features
   are 84 +/- 14\% and 78 +/- 12\%. Moreover, this EEG/fMRI model showed
   significant improvements compared to the clinical diagnosis, whereas the
   models using metrics from either EEG or fMRI do not reach significance
   (p > 0.05).
   Temporal metrics computationally derived from EEG and fMRI time signals
   may clinically aid and synergistically improve the predictive value in a
   first-seizure sample. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {The BOLD response in primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area
   during kinesthetic motor imagery based graded fMRI neurofeedback},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {36-44},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in exploring the use of functional MRI
   neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) as a therapeutic technique for a range of
   neurological conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD). One
   main therapeutic potential of fMRI-NF is to enhance volitional control
   of damaged or dysfunctional neural nodes and networks via a closed-loop
   feedback model using mental imagery as the catalyst of self-regulation.
   The choice of target node/network and direction of regulation (increase
   or decrease activity) are central design considerations in fMRI-NF
   studies. Whilst it remains unclear whether the primary motor cortex (M1)
   can be activated during motor imagery, the supplementary motor area
   (SMA) has been robustly activated during motor imagery. Such differences
   in the regulation potential between primary and supplementary motor
   cortex are important because these areas can be differentially affected
   by a stroke or PD, and the choice of fMRI-NF target and grade of
   self-regulation of activity likely have substantial influence on the
   clinical effects and cost effectiveness of NF-based interventions. In
   this study we therefore investigated firstly whether healthy subjects
   would be able to achieve self-regulation of the hand-representation
   areas of M1 and the SMA using fMRI-NF training. There was a significant
   decrease in M1 neural activity during fMRI-NF, whereas SMA neural
   activity was increased, albeit not with the predicated graded effect.
   This study has important implications for fMRI-NF protocols that employ
   motor imagery to modulate activity in specific target regions of the
   brain and to determine how they may be tailored for neurorehabilitation.},

Title = {Multiband fMRI as a plausible, time-saving technique for resting-state
   data acquisition: Study on functional connectivity mapping using graph
   theoretical measures},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1-6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Ensuring patient comfort and compliance by
   emphasizing reduced time frame for image acquisition, without
   compromising image quality is the key aspect with functional MRI
   examination. Multiband resting state fMRI (MB-rsfMRI) is a fairly new
   technique that potentially shortens MR image acquisition time by
   providing increased number of time points. The study aims to compare
   signal characteristics as well as the functional connectivity using
   conventional resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) with that of MB-rsfMRI
   technique.
   Materials and methods: 9 healthy volunteers have prospectively undergone
   conventional resting-state fMRI and Multiband rsfMRI scanning technique
   in a 3T GE scanner (Discovery MR750w (TM)). We compared the temporal SNR
   (tSNR) of conventional rs-fMRI with that of MB-rsfMRI. We looked at the
   language network connectivity and small world network characteristics
   from graph theoretical measures to compare the two techniques.
   Results: We computed the tSNR of conventional resting-state fMRI
   (rsfMRI) and MB-rsfMRI technique. A strong positive correlation was seen
   between graph theoretical measures from MB-rsfMRI and conventional
   rsfMRI (Pearson Correlation, r = 0.99). Both techniques showed similar
   small world network characteristics in healthy controls.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrates negligible differences
   between the conventional-rsfMRI and MB-rsfMRI acquisitions on the
   computed graph theoretic measures. Accordingly current analysis proves
   that MB-rsfMRI may be used as a time reducing acquisition technique that
   enables mapping of functional connectivity with similar outcome as
   conventional rs-fMRI in healthy subjects.},

Title = {RoWDI: rolling window detection of sleep intrusions in the awake brain
   using fMRI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective. Brief episodes of sleep can intrude into the awake human
   brain due to lack of sleep or fatigue-compromising the safety of
   critical daily tasks (i.e. driving). These intrusions can also introduce
   artefactual activity within functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   experiments, prompting the need for an objective and effective method of
   removing them. Approach. We have developed a method to track sleep-like
   events in awake humans via rolling window detection of intrusions
   (RoWDI) of fMRI signal template. These events can then be used in
   voxel-wise event-related analysis of fMRI data. To test this approach,
   we generated a template of fMRI activity associated with transition to
   sleep via simultaneous fMRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) (N = 10).
   RoWDI was then used to identify sleep-like events in 20 individuals
   performing a cognitive task during fMRI after a night of partial sleep
   deprivation. This approach was further validated in an independent fMRI
   dataset (N = 56). Main results. Our method (RoWDI) was able to infer
   frequent sleep-like events during the cognitive task performed after
   sleep deprivation. The sleep-like events were associated with on average
   of 20\% reduction in pupil size and prolonged response time. The
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity during the sleep-like events
   covered thalami-cortical regions, which although spatially distinct,
   co-existed with, task-related activity. These key findings were
   validated in the independent dataset. Significance. RoWDI can reliably
   detect spontaneous sleep-like events in the human brain. Thus, it may
   also be used as a tool to delineate and account for neural activity
   associated with wake-sleep transitions in both resting-state and
   task-related fMRI studies.},

Title = {Seed-Based Connectivity Analysis of Resting-State fMRI in Patients with
   Brain Tumors: A Feasibility Study},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {E165-E176},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study, we present our experience using resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in preoperative
   planning. We performed group analysis to demonstrate the effects of
   brain tumor on resting-state networks (RSNs).
   METHODS: Thirty patients with supratentorial gliomas were included in
   the study. Preoperative rs-fMRI and structural magnetic resonance
   imaging were performed in all cases. The rs-fMRI was preprocessed
   (realignment, slice time correction, coregistration to structural
   images, normalization, and smoothing). The structural images were
   segmented and normalized. Band filtering and denoising were applied to
   the functional images. Connectivity analysis was performed using
   seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) at single subject level and group
   level. Correlation algorism has been used with r > 0.5.
   RESULTS: RSNs could be detected in all patients. They showed similarity
   to the results of the task-based fMRI, when task-based fMRI was
   feasible. Detection of the networks was also possible in patients with
   neurologic deficits, in whom task-based fMRI was not possible. We could
   use SCA in patients under anesthesia. High-level networks (default mode,
   salience, and dorsal attention networks) were detectable but showed a
   wide spectrum of spatial alterations and component disconnections.
   CONCLUSIONS: rs-fMRI is a feasible method for extended brain mapping.
   Diverse RSNs could be detected in patients with brain tumors and could
   be applied in preoperative planning. SCA was a robust and direct
   approach for data analysis and could answer specific clinically relevant
   questions. However, further studies are needed to validate the technique
   and its clinical impact.},

Title = {Mutual connectivity analysis of resting-state functional MRI data with
   local models},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {210-223},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) can represent
   brain networks and reveal insights into interactions amongst different
   brain regions. However, most connectivity analysis approaches adopted in
   practice are linear and non-directional. In this paper, we demonstrate
   the advantage of a data-driven, directed connectivity analysis approach
   called Mutual Connectivity Analysis using Local Models (MCA-LM) that
   approximates connectivity by modeling nonlinear dependencies of signal
   interaction, over more conventionally used approaches, such as Pearson's
   and partial correlation, Patel's conditional dependence measures,
   etcetera. We demonstrate on realistic simulations of fMRI data that, at
   long sampling intervals, i.e. high repetition time (TR) of fMRI signals,
   MCA-LM performs better than or comparable to correlation-based methods
   and Patel's measures. However, at fast image acquisition rates
   corresponding to low TR, MCA-LM significantly outperforms these methods.
   This insight is particularly useful in the light of recent advances in
   fast fMRI acquisition techniques. Methods that can capture the complex
   dynamics of brain activity, such as MCA-LM, should be adopted to extract
   as much information as possible from the improved representation.
   Furthermore, MCA-LM works very well for simulations generated at weak
   neuronal interaction strengths, and simulations modeling inhibitory and
   excitatory connections as it disentangles the two opposing effects
   between pairs of regions/voxels. Additionally, we demonstrate that
   MCA-LM is capable of capturing meaningful directed connectivity on
   experimental fMRI data. Such results suggest that it introduces
   sufficient complexity into modeling fMRI time-series interactions that
   simple, linear approaches cannot, while being data-driven,
   computationally practical and easy to use. In conclusion, MCA-LM can
   provide valuable insights towards better understanding brain activity.},

Title = {Functional connectivity of EEG is subject-specific, associated with
   phenotype, and different from fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {218},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A variety of psychiatric, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes have been
   linked to brain `'functional connectivity{''}- the pattern of
   correlation observed between different brain regions. Most commonly
   assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here, we
   investigate the connectivity-phenotype associations with functional
   connectivity measured with electroencephalography (EEG), using
   phase-coupling. We analyzed data from the publicly available Healthy
   Brain Network Biobank. This database compiles a growing sample of
   children and adolescents, currently encompassing 1657 individuals. Among
   a variety of assessment instruments we focus on ten phenotypic and
   additional demographic measures that capture most of the variance in
   this sample. The largest effect sizes are found for age and sex for both
   fMRI and EEG. We replicate previous findings of an association of
   Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
   (ADHD) with the pattern of fMRI func-tional connectivity. We also find
   an association with socioeconomic status, anxiety and the Child Behavior
   Checklist Score. For EEG we find a significant connectivity-phenotype
   relationship with IQ. The actual spatial patterns of functional
   connectivity are quite different between fMRI and source-space EEG.
   However, within EEG we observe clusters of functional connectivity that
   are consistent across frequency bands. Additionally we analyzed
   reproducibility of functional connectivity. We compare connectivity
   obtained with different tasks, including resting state, a video and a
   visual flicker task. For both EEG and fMRI the variation between tasks
   was smaller than the variability observed between subjects. We also
   found an increase of reliability with increasing frequency of the EEG,
   and increased sampling duration. We conclude that, while the patterns of
   functional connectivity are distinct between fMRI and phase-coupling of
   EEG, they are nonetheless similar in their robust-ness to the task, and
   similar in that idiosyncratic patterns of connectivity predict
   individual phenotypes.},

Title = {Brain-based sex differences in schizophrenia: A systematic review of
   fMRI studies},
Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with characteristic
   symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, lack of motivation, and paucity
   of thought. Recent evidence suggests that the symptoms of schizophrenia,
   negative symptoms in particular, vary widely between the sexes and that
   symptom onset is earlier in males. A better understanding of sex-based
   differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of
   schizophrenia may provide a key to understanding sex-based symptom
   differences. This study aimed to summarize sex-based functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) differences in brain activity of patients with
   schizophrenia. We searched PubMed and Scopus to find fMRI studies that
   assessed sex-based differences in the brain activity of patients with
   schizophrenia. We excluded studies that did not evaluate brain activity
   using fMRI, did not evaluate sex differences, and were nonhuman or in
   vitro studies. We found 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria for
   the current systematic review. Compared to females with schizophrenia,
   males with schizophrenia showed more blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   activation in the cerebellum, the temporal gyrus, and the right
   precuneus cortex. Male patients also had greater occurrence of
   low-frequency fluctuations in cerebral blood flow in frontal and
   parietal lobes and the insular cortex, while female patients had greater
   occurrence of low-frequency fluctuations in the hippocampus,
   parahippocampus, and lentiform nucleus. The current study summarizes
   fMRI studies that evaluated sex-based fMRI brain differences in
   schizophrenia that may help to shed light on the underlying
   pathophysiology and further understanding of sex-based differences in
   the clinical presentation and course of the disorder.},

Title = {Designing individual-specific and trial-specific models to accurately
   predict the intensity of nociceptive pain from single-trial fMRI
   responses},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Using machine learning to predict the intensity of pain from fMRI has
   attracted rapidly increasing interests. However, due to remarkable
   inter- and intra-individual variabilities in pain responses, the
   performance of existing fMRI-based pain prediction models is far from
   satisfactory. The present study proposed a new approach which can design
   a prediction model specific to each individual or each experimental
   trial so that the specific model can achieve more accurate prediction of
   the intensity of nociceptive pain from single-trial fMRI responses. More
   precisely, the new approach uses a supervised k-means method on
   nociceptive-evoked fMRI responses to cluster individuals or trials into
   a set of subgroups, each of which has similar and consistent fMRI
   activation patterns. Then, for a new test individual/trial, the proposed
   approach chooses one subgroup of individuals/trials, which has the
   closest fMRI patterns to the test individual/trial, as training samples
   to train an individual-specific or a trialspecific pain prediction
   model. The new approach was tested on a nociceptive-evoked fMRI dataset
   and achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than conventional
   non-specific models, which used all available training samples to train
   a model. The generalizability of the proposed approach is further
   validated by training specific models on one dataset and testing these
   models on an independent new dataset. This proposed individual-specific
   and trial-specific pain prediction approach has the potential to be used
   for the development of individualized and precise pain assessment tools
   in clinical practice.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Although increasingly used in both neuroscience and clinical
   studies, a major challenge facing resting-state FMRI (rs-FMRI) still
   lies in isolating BOLD signal fluctuations resulting from neuronal
   activity from noise. In this study, we investigated the effect of a
   newly proposed denoising approach, integrated multi-echo rs-FMRI
   analysis, on language mapping.
   Methods: Multiband multi-echo rs-FMRI data were acquired, along with
   language task FMRI that identified language areas in the left hemisphere
   of 12 subjects. The language laterality and specificity of the language
   mapping given by seed-based correlation analysis were compared among the
   rs-FMRI data sets pre-processed using 3 different approaches: multi-echo
   data with integrated multi-echo independent component analysis,
   denoising that uses the TE-dependency of each signal component to judge
   its origin, and multi-echo and single-echo data with conventional
   denoising. The laterality index was automatically computed without
   setting any threshold to minimize the arbitrariness and to ensure the
   generality of the result.
   Results: A repeated measures analysis of variance followed by post hoc
   tests showed that optimal combination of the 3-echo data succeeded in
   increasing the correlation within the targeted language system. With the
   physically principled multi-echo denoising approach, the integrated
   strategy further succeeded in revealing areas of synchronization more
   specific to the language system compared with conventional denoising
   approach, which eventually improved the identification of the laterality
   of the system.
   Conclusion: By successfully reducing non-specific correlations spreading
   over the brain, integrated multi-echo approach improved language mapping
   and identification of the laterality of the system using rs-FMRI.},

Title = {Correlation of Preoperative Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
   with Intraoperative Cortical Stimulation in Surgeries of Eloquent Brain

Abstract = {Background: Direct Cortical Stimulation (DCS) represents the gold
   standard for mapping of eloquent brain cortex. However, DCS is an
   invasive and time-consuming procedure. fMRI has become a useful tool to
   delineate motor and sensory eloquent cortex from the areas of planned
   neurosurgical resection. In our study, we will be studying the
   reliability of preoperative imaging when compared with the
   intraoperative DCS.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of fMRI
   by comparing it with DCS.
   Methods and Materials: Thirty patients with eloquent cortex lesions were
   admitted. Preoperative fMRI sequences were loaded into a
   neuro-navigational system. Intraoperative motor mapping was done by DCS.
   The location of all cortical stimulated points was correlated with the
   cortical functional structures. Based on it, specificity, sensitivity,
   positive predictive value, negative predictive value of fMRI was
   calculated. Preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky score and MRC
   grading was then noted.
   Results: Concordance between fMRI and DCS was noted in 26 cases. Overall
   mean sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of
   fMRI as compared to DCS was 95\%, 92.48\%, 85.56\%, and 96.08\%,
   respectively. Preoperative and Postoperative Karnofsky score stayed same
   in most of the cases {[}25/30].
   Conclusions: DCS remains the gold standard for mapping eloquent cortex
   in-spite of its invasiveness, side effects such as seizures and cost
   concerns. Although fMRI cannot replace DCS, it can guide and increase
   the efficacy in resection, select high-risk patients for intraoperative
   monitoring, help in preoperative stratification of risk counseling and
   preservation of neurological status in eloquent brain lesions.},

Title = {Functional Activities Detected in the Olfactory Bulb and Associated

Abstract = {Olfaction is a fundamental sense that plays a vital role in daily life
   in humans, and can be altered in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative
   diseases. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) using conventional echo-planar-imaging (EPI)
   based sequences can be challenging in brain regions important for
   olfactory processing, such as the olfactory bulb (OB) and orbitofrontal
   cortex, mainly due to the signal dropout and distortion artifacts caused
   by large susceptibility effects from the sinonasal cavity and temporal
   bone. To date, few studies have demonstrated successful fMRI in the OB
   in humans. T2-prepared (T2prep) BOLD fMRI is an alternative approach
   developed especially for performing fMRI in regions affected by large
   susceptibility artifacts. The purpose of this technical study is to
   evaluate T2prep BOLD fMRI for olfactory functional experiments in
   humans. Olfactory fMRI scans were performed on 7T in 14 healthy
   participants. T2prep BOLD showed greater sensitivity than GRE EPI BOLD
   in the OB, orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole. Functional
   activation was detected using T2prep BOLD in the OB and associated
   olfactory regions. Habituation effects and a bi-phasic pattern of fMRI
   signal changes during olfactory stimulation were observed in all
   regions. Both positively and negatively activated regions were observed
   during olfactory stimulation. These signal characteristics are generally
   consistent with literature and showed a good intra-subject
   reproducibility comparable to previous human BOLD fMRI studies. In
   conclusion, the methodology demonstrated in this study holds promise for
   future olfactory fMRI studies in the OB and other brain regions that
   suffer from large susceptibility artifacts.},

Title = {Individual differences in rate of acquiring stable neural
   representations of tasks in fMRI},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a
   widely-used tool for studying the neural processing correlates of human
   behavior in both healthy and clinical populations. There is growing
   interest in mapping individual differences in fMRI task behavior and
   neural responses. By utilizing neuroadaptive task designs accounting for
   such individual differences, task durations can be personalized to
   potentially optimize neuroimaging study outcomes (e.g., classification
   of task-related brain states). To test this hypothesis, we first
   retrospectively tracked the volume-by-volume changes of beta weights
   generated from general linear models (GLM) for 67 adult subjects
   performing a stop-signal task (SST).We then modeled the convergence of
   the volume-by-volume changes of beta weights according to their
   exponential decay (ED) in units of half-life. Our results showed
   significant differences in beta weight convergence estimates of optimal
   stopping times (OSTs) between go following successful stop trials and
   failed stop trials for both cocaine dependent (CD) and control group
   (Con), and between go following successful stop trials and go following
   failed stop trials for Con group. Further, we implemented support vector
   machine (SVM) classification for 67 CD/Con labeled subjects and compared
   the classification accuracies of fMRI-based features derived from (1)
   the full fMRI task versus (2) the fMRI task truncated to multiples of
   the unit of half-life. Among the computed binary classification
   accuracies, two types of task durations based on 2 half-lives
   significantly outperformed the accuracies using fully acquired trials,
   supporting this length as the OST for the SST. In conclusion, we
   demonstrate the potential of a neuroadaptive task design that can be
   widely applied to personalizing other task-based fMRI experiments in
   either dynamic real-time fMRI applications or within fMRI preprocessing
   pipelines.},

Abstract = {Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is commonly used to study the brain's
   intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal
   patterns in the form of resting state networks (RSNs). It has been
   hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are driven by
   underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much
   faster timescales (>5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this
   relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans
   while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to
   entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two
   driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's alpha rhythm (8 -
   12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope.
   We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two
   different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were
   synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower
   oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS).
   Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity
   within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS.
   This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more
   effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric
   coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence
   that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of
   fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's
   intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing
   appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for
   patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.},

Abstract = {Objective: Presurgical language assessment can help minimize damage to
   eloquent cortex during resective epilepsy surgery. Two methods for
   presurgical language mapping are functional MRI (fMRI) and direct
   cortical stimulation (DCS) of implanted subdural electrodes. We compared
   fMRI results to DCS to help optimize noninvasive language localization
   and assess its validity.
   Methods: We studied 19 patients referred for presurgical evaluation of
   drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients completed four language tasks during
   preoperative fMRI. After subdural electrode implantation, we used DCS to
   localize language areas. For each stimulation site, we determined
   whether language positive electrode pairs intersected with significant
   fMRI activity clusters for language tasks.
   Results: Sensitivity and specificity depended on electrode region of
   interest radii and statistical thresholding. For patients with at least
   one language positive stimulation site, an auditory description decision
   task provided the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
   For patients with no language positive stimulation sites, fMRI was a
   dependable method of excluding eloquent language processing.
   Interpretation: Language fMRI is an effective tool for determining
   language lateralization before electrode implantation and is especially
   useful for excluding unexpected critical language areas. It can help
   guide subdural electrode implantation and narrow the search for eloquent
   cortical areas by DCS.},

   Amplitudes of Resting-State fMRI Signals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, >0.1 Hz) of resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) signals have received much attention in recent years.
   Denoising is critical for HFO studies. Previous work indicated that head
   motion (HM) has remarkable influences on a variety of rs-fMRI metrics,
   but its influences on rs-fMRI HFOs are still unknown. In this study, we
   investigated the impacts of HM regression (HMR) on HFO results using a
   fast sampling rs-fMRI dataset. We demonstrated that apparent
   high-frequency (similar to 0.2-0.4 Hz) components existed in the HM
   trajectories in almost all subjects. In addition, we found that
   individual-level HMR could robustly reveal more between-condition
   (eye-open vs. eye-closed) amplitude differences in high-frequency bands.
   Although regression of mean framewise displacement (FD) at the group
   level had little impact on the results, mean FD could significantly
   account for inter-subject variance of HFOs even after individual-level
   HMR. Our findings suggest that HM artifacts should not be ignored in HFO
   studies, and HMR is necessary for detecting HFO between-condition
   differences.},

Abstract = {Laminar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds the potential
   to study connectivity at the laminar level in humans. Here we analyze
   simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and high-resolution
   fMRI data to investigate how EEG power modulations, induced by a task
   with an attentional component, relate to changes in fMRI laminar
   connectivity between and within brain regions in visual cortex. Our
   results indicate that our task-induced decrease in beta power relates to
   an increase in deep-to-deep layer coupling between regions and to an
   increase in deep/middle-to-superficial layer connectivity within brain
   regions. The attention-related alpha power decrease predominantly
   relates to reduced connectivity between deep and superficial layers
   within brain regions, since, unlike beta power, alpha power was found to
   be positively correlated to connectivity. We observed no strong relation
   between laminar connectivity and gamma band oscillations. These results
   indicate that especially beta band, and to a lesser extent, alpha band
   oscillations relate to laminar-specific fMRI connectivity. The
   differential effects for alpha and beta bands indicate that they relate
   to different feedback-related neural processes that are differentially
   expressed in intra-region laminar fMRI-based connectivity.},

Abstract = {Background Functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used to study abnormal
   patterns of functional connectivity at rest in patients with movement
   disorders such as idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical
   parkinsonisms. Methods This manuscript provides an educational review of
   the current use of resting-state fMRI in the field of parkinsonian
   syndromes. Results Resting-state fMRI studies have improved the current
   knowledge about the mechanisms underlying motor and non-motor symptom
   development and progression in movement disorders. Even if its inclusion
   in clinical practice is still far away, resting-state fMRI has the
   potential to be a promising biomarker for early disease detection and
   prediction. It may also aid in differential diagnosis and monitoring
   brain responses to therapeutic agents and neurorehabilitation strategies
   in different movement disorders. Conclusions There is urgent need to
   identify and validate prodromal biomarkers in PD patients, to perform
   further studies assessing both overlapping and disease-specific fMRI
   abnormalities among parkinsonian syndromes, and to continue technical
   advances to fully realize the potential of fMRI as a tool to monitor the

Abstract = {Task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely
   employed for brain activation detection and brain network analysis.
   Modeling rich information from spatially-organized collection of fMRI
   time series is challenging because of the intrinsic complexity.
   Hypothesis-driven methods, such as the general linear model (GLM), which
   regress exterior stimulus from voxel-wise functional brain activity, are
   limited due to overlooking the complexity of brain activities and the
   diversity of concurrent brain networks. Recently, sparse representation
   and dictionary learning methods have attracted increasing interests in
   task fMRI data analysis. The major advantage of this methodology is its
   promise in reconstructing concurrent brain networks systematically.
   However, this data-driven strategy is, to some extent, arbitrary and
   does not sufficiently utilize the prior information of task design and
   neuroscience knowledge. To bridge this gap, we here propose a novel
   supervised sparse representation and dictionary learning framework based
   on stochastic coordinate coding (SCC) algorithm for task fMRI data
   analysis, in which certain brain networks are learned with known
   information such as pre-defined temporal patterns and spatial network
   patterns, and at the same time other networks are learned automatically
   from data. Our proposed method has been applied to two independent task
   fMRI datasets, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations have shown
   that our method provides a new and effective framework for task fMRI
   data analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {fMRI hemodynamic response function estimation in autoregressive noise by
   avoiding the drift},
Journal = {DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {29-41},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series is
   typically corrupted by instrumental drift and physiological noise due to
   respiration and heartbeat giving rise to temporal correlation in the
   signals. Most methods proposed so far for nonparametric hemodynamic
   response function (HRF) estimation in fMRI data do not account for these
   confounding effects, and thus produce biased and inefficient estimates.
   The aim of this paper is to address this issue by modeling the noise in
   fMRI time series using an autoregressive model of order p (AR(p)).
   Making use of a semiparametric model to characterize the fMRI time
   series and the AR(p) to model the temporally correlated noise, a
   generalized least squares (GLS) estimator for voxelwise consistent
   nonparametric HRF estimation is derived. The proposed estimation method
   is a three-stage procedure that relies on first-order differencing to
   remove drift and a novel structured covariance estimator for the AR
   noise based on Cholesky decomposition to derive the best linear unbiased
   estimator (BLUE) of the HRF. We also establish the asymptotic
   consistency of the proposed estimator. Simulation results show that the
   proposed method generates more accurate HRF estimates compared to
   existing methods. When applied to real fMRI data, it demonstrates the
   effectiveness in uncovering the brain response temporal dynamics for
   both event-related and block-design paradigms. Our approach removes the
   two types of noise in fMRI data simultaneously, thus providing efficient
   estimation of brain hemodynamic responses, while allowing for flexible
   characterization of the shape and timing of the voxelwise HRF. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Oscillatory neural dynamics play an important role in the coordination
   of large-scale brain networks. High-level cognitive processes depend on
   dynamics evolving over hundreds of milliseconds, so measuring neural
   activity in this frequency range is important for cognitive
   neuroscience. However, current noninvasive neuroimaging methods are not
   able to precisely localize oscillatory neural activity above 0.2 Hz.
   Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography have limited spatial
   resolution, whereas fMRI has limited temporal resolution because it
   measures vascular responses rather than directly recording neural
   activity. We hypothesized that the recent development of fast fMRI
   techniques, combined with the extra sensitivity afforded by
   ultra-high-field systems, could enable precise localization of neural
   oscillations. We tested whether fMRI can detect neural oscillations
   using human visual cortex as a model system. We detected small
   oscillatory fMRI signals in response to stimuli oscillating at up to
   0.75 Hz within single scan sessions, and these responses were an order
   of magnitude larger than predicted by canonical linear models.
   Simultaneous EEG-fMRI and simulations based on a biophysical model of
   the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity suggested that the blood
   oxygen level-dependent response becomes faster for rapidly varying
   stimuli, enabling the detection of higher frequencies than expected.
   Accounting for phase delays across voxels further improved detection,
   demonstrating that identifying vascular delays will be of increasing
   importance with higher-frequency activity. These results challenge the
   assumption that the hemodynamic response is slow, and demonstrate that
   fMRI has the potential to map neural oscillations directly throughout
   the brain.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Motion correction of echo-planar imaging (EPI) data used in functional
   MRI (fMRI) is an essential preprocessing step performed prior to
   statistical analysis. At ultra-high resolution fMRI, current
   requirements regarding translational and rotational motion may no longer
   be acceptable. This prompts the need for a systematic investigation of
   the effects of motion correction procedures with in vivo fMRI data. Here
   we systematically evaluated the effect of retrospective motion
   correction with freely available fMRI analysis software packages (FSL,
   AFNI, and SPM) on activation maps using fMRI data acquired with
   prospective motion detection, to identify and quantify confounding
   effects of retrospective motion correction, and to evaluate its
   dependence on spatial resolution and motion correction algorithms. Brain
   activation maps were obtained for two different resolutions, an
   ultrahigh, that is, 0.65(3) mm(3), and a more widely used 2.0(3) mm(3)
   isotropic resolutions at 7 T. The EPI data were acquired using
   simultaneous non-image- based optical moire phase tracking (MPT) of
   physical motion. The results showed that image-based motion detection,
   performed by SPM8 software package, may be erroneous in high-field fMRI
   data with partial brain coverage and can introduce spurious motion
   leading to false-positive and false-negative activation. Further
   analyses demonstrated that limited acquisition field of view has the
   dominant influence on the effect. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   interfaces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) implemented with real-time
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) use fMRI time-courses
   from predefined regions of interest (ROIs). To reach best performances,
   localizer experiments and on-site expert supervision are required for
   ROI definition. To automate this step, we developed two unsupervised
   computational techniques based on the general linear model (GLM) and
   independent component analysis (ICA) of rt-fMRI data, and compared their
   performances on a communication BCI. Approach. 3 T fMRI data of six
   volunteers were re-analyzed in simulated real-time. During a localizer
   run, participants performed three mental tasks following visual cues.
   During two communication runs, a letter-spelling display guided the
   subjects to freely encode letters by performing one of the mental tasks
   with a specific timing. GLM- and ICA-based procedures were used to
   decode each letter, respectively using compact ROIs and whole-brain
   distributed spatio-temporal patterns of fMRI activity, automatically
   defined from subject-specific or group-level maps. Main results.
   Letter-decoding performances were comparable to supervised methods. In
   combination with a similarity-based criterion, GLM- and ICA-based
   approaches successfully decoded more than 80\% (average) of the letters.
   Subject-specific maps yielded optimal performances. Significance.
   Automated solutions for ROI selection may help accelerating the
   translation of rt-fMRI BCIs from research to clinical applications.},

Title = {Studying the Alzheimer's disease continuum using EEG and fMRI in
   single-modality and multi-modality settings},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 1},
Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a biological, clinical continuum that covers
   the preclinical, prodromal, and clinical phases of the disease. Early
   diagnosis and identification of the stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   are crucial in clinical practice. Ideally, biomarkers should reflect the
   underlying process (pathological or otherwise), be reproducible and
   non-invasive, and allow repeated measurements over time. However, the
   currently known biomarkers for AD are not suitable for differentiating
   the stages and predicting the trajectory of disease progression. Some
   objective parameters extracted using electroencephalography (EEG) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are widely applied to
   diagnose the stages of the AD continuum. While electroencephalography
   (EEG) has a high temporal resolution, fMRI has a high spatial
   resolution. Combined EEG and fMRI (EEG-fMRI) can overcome
   single-modality drawbacks and obtain multi-dimensional information
   simultaneously, and it can help explore the hemodynamic changes
   associated with the neural oscillations that occur during information
   processing. This technique has been used in the cognitive field in
   recent years. This review focuses on the different techniques available
   for studying the AD continuum, including EEG and fMRI in single-modality
   and multi-modality settings, and the possible future directions of AD
   diagnosis using EEG-fMRI.},

Abstract = {To date, fMRI research has been concerned primarily with evincing
   generic principles of brain function through averaging data from
   multiple subjects. Given rapid developments in both hardware and
   analysis tools, the field is now poised to study fMRI-derived measures
   in individual subjects, and to relate these to psychological traits or
   genetic variations. We discuss issues of validity, reliability and
   statistical assessment that arise when the focus shifts to individual
   subjects and that are applicable also to other imaging modalities. We
   emphasize that individual assessment of neural function with fMRI
   presents specific challenges and necessitates careful consideration of
   anatomical and vascular between-subject variability as well as sources
   of within-subject variability.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Providing a reliable assessment of language lateralization is
   an important task to be performed prior to neurosurgery in patients with
   epilepsy. Over the last decade, functional MRI (fMRI) has emerged as a
   useful noninvasive tool for language lateralization, supplementing or
   replacing traditional invasive methods. In standard practice, fMRI-based
   language lateralization is assessed qualitatively by visual inspection
   of fMRI maps at a specific chosen activation threshold. The purpose of
   this study was to develop and evaluate a new computational technique for
   providing the probability of each patient to be left, right, or
   bilateral dominant in language processing.
   METHODS In 76 patients with epilepsy, a language lateralization index
   was calculated using the verb-generation fMRI task over a wide range of
   activation thresholds (from a permissive threshold, analyzing all brain
   regions, to a harsh threshold, analyzing only the strongest
   activations). The data were classified using a probabilistic logistic
   regression method.
   RESULTS Concordant results between fMRI and Wada lateralization were
   observed in 89\% of patients. Bilateral and right-dominant groups showed
   similar fMRI lateralization patterns differentiating them from the
   left-dominant group but still allowing classification in 82\% of
   patients.
   CONCLUSIONS These findings present the utility of a semi-supervised
   probabilistic learning approach for presurgical language-dominance
   mapping, which may be extended to other cognitive domains such as memory
   and attention.},

Title = {Neurovascular coupling in eye-open-eye-close task and resting state:
   Spectral correspondence between concurrent EEG and fMRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {289},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Neurovascular coupling serves as an essential neurophysiological
   mechanism in functional neuroimaging, which is generally presumed to be
   robust and invariant across different physiological states, encompassing
   both task engagement and resting state. Nevertheless, emerging evidence
   suggests that neurovascular coupling may exhibit state dependency, even
   in normal human participants. To investigate this premise, we analyzed
   the crossfrequency spectral correspondence between concurrently recorded
   electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) data, utilizing them as proxies for neurovascular coupling during
   the two conditions: an eye-open-eye-close (EOEC) task and a resting
   state. We hypothesized that given the state dependency of neurovascular
   coupling, EEG-fMRI spectral correspondences would change between the two
   conditions in the visual system. During the EOEC task, we observed a
   negative phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC) between EEG alpha-band and fMRI
   visual activity. Conversely, in the resting state, a pronounced
   amplitudeamplitude-coupling (AAC) emerged between EEG and fMRI signals,
   as evidenced by the spectral correspondence between the EEG gamma-band
   of the midline occipital channel (Oz) and the high-frequency fMRI
   signals (0.15-0.25 Hz) in the visual network. This study reveals
   distinct scenarios of EEG-fMRI spectral correspondence in healthy
   participants, corroborating the state-dependent nature of neurovascular
   coupling.},

Abstract = {Background: Brain functional abnormalities have been commonly reported
   in anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, social
   anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobias. The
   role of functional abnormalities in the discrimination of these
   disorders can be tested with machine learning (ML) techniques. Here, we
   aim to provide a comprehensive overview of ML studies exploring the
   potential discriminating role of functional brain alterations identified
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in anxiety disorders.
   Methods: We conducted a search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus of
   ML investigations using fMRI as features in patients with anxiety
   disorders. A total of 12 studies (resting-state fMRI n = 5, task-based
   fMRI n = 6, resting-state and task-based fMRI n=1) met our inclusion
   criteria. Results: Overall, the studies showed that, regardless of the
   classifiers, alterations in functional connectivity and aberrant neural
   activation involving the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex,
   hippocampus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, cerebellum,
   default mode network, dorsal attention network, sensory network, and
   affective network were able to discriminate patients with anxiety from
   controls, with accuracies spanning from 36 \% to 94 \%. Limitations: The
   small sample size, different ML approaches and heterogeneity in the
   selection of regions included in the multivariate pattern analyses limit
   the conclusions of the present review. Conclusions: ML methods using
   fMRI as features can distinguish patients with anxiety disorders from
   healthy controls, indicating that these techniques could be used as a
   helpful tool for the diagnosis and the development of more targeted
   treatments for these disorders.},

Title = {Localizing Spectral Interactions in the Resting State Network Using the
   Hilbert-Huang Transform},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Brain synchronizations are orchestrated from neuronal oscillations
   through frequency interactions, such as the alpha rhythm during
   relaxation. Nevertheless, how the intrinsic interaction forges
   functional integrity across brain segregations remains elusive, thereby
   motivating recent studies to localize frequency interactions of
   resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). To this point, we aim to unveil the
   fMRI-based spectral interactions using the time-frequency (TF) analysis;
   however, Fourier-based TF analyses impose restrictions on revealing
   frequency interactions given the limited time points in fMRI signals.
   Instead of using the Fourier-based wavelet analysis to identify the fMRI
   frequency of interests, we employed the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT)
   for probing the specific frequency contribution to the functional
   integration, called ensemble spectral interaction (ESI). By simulating
   data with time-variant frequency changes, we demonstrated the Hilbert TF
   maps with high spectro-temporal resolution and full accessibility in
   comparison with the wavelet TF maps. By detecting amplitude-to-amplitude
   frequency couplings (AAC) across brain regions, we elucidated the ESI
   disparity between the eye-closed (EC) and eye-open (EO) conditions in
   rs-fMRI. In the visual network, the strength of the spectral interaction
   within 0.03-0.04 Hz was amplified in EC compared with that in EO
   condition, whereas a canonical connectivity analysis did not present
   differences between conditions. Collectively, leveraging from the
   instantaneous frequency of HHT, we firstly addressed the ESI technique
   to map the fMRI-based functional connectivity in a brand-new AAC
   perspective. The ESI possesses potential in elucidating the functional
   connectivity at specific frequency bins, thereby providing additional
   diagnostic merits for future clinical neuroscience.},

Title = {Robust Presurgical Functional MRI at 7 T Using Response Consistency},

Abstract = {Functional MRI is valuable in presurgical planning due to its
   non-invasive nature, repeatability, and broad availability. Using
   ultra-high field MRI increases the specificity and sensitivity,
   increasing the localization reliability and reducing scan time. Ideally,
   fMRI analysis for this application should identify unreliable runs and
   work even if the patient deviates from the prescribed task timing or if
   there are changes to the hemodynamic response due to pathology. In this
   study, a model-free analysis method-UNBIASED-based on the consistency of
   fMRI responses over runs was applied, to ultra-high field fMRI
   localizations of the hand area. Ten patients with brain tumors and
   epilepsy underwent 7 Tesla fMRI with multiple runs of a hand motor task
   in a block design. FMRI data were analyzed with the proposed approach
   (UNBIASED) and the conventional General Linear Model (GLM) approach.
   UNBIASED correctly identified and excluded fMRI runs that contained
   little or no activation. Generally, less motion artifact contamination
   was present in UNBIASED than in GLM results. Some cortical regions were
   identified as activated in UNBIASED but not GLM results. These were
   confirmed to show reproducible delayed or transient activation, which
   was time-locked to the task. UNBIASED is a robust approach to generating
   activation maps without the need for assumptions about response timing
   or shape. In presurgical planning, UNBIASED can complement model-based
   methods to aid surgeons in making prudent choices about optimal surgical
   access and resection margins for each patient, even if the hemodynamic
   response is modified by pathology. (C) 2017 The Authors Human Brain

Title = {Multi-site diagnostic classification of Autism spectrum disorder using
   adversarial deep learning on resting-state fMRI},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {85},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Existing imaging studies in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) mainly
   focused on single-site resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) data, which may contain limited samples and suffer
   from geographic bias. The lack of effective detection in information
   mining of rs-fMRI is a main reason for affecting the recognition rate of
   multi-site diagnostic. This study aims to propose a two-stage
   adversarial learning model with sliding window that integrates
   information from multi-site rs-fMRI data at the cost of minimal
   information loss. First, single rs-fMRI data is sampled with a sliding
   window to preserve both the spatial and temporal information of original
   data. And then, site-shared features of these samples are extracted
   through an adversarial learning model. Finally, the model is fine-tuned
   to learn discriminative disease-related features. Experimental results
   show that through adversarial learning, the heterogeneity problem among
   multi-site data is solved. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal information
   on rs-fMRI is effectively extracted and yields better classification
   performance (0.80 accuracy, 0.81 sensitivity, 0.80 specificity) than the
   state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the
   proposed method in the ASD classification task and the importance of
   fully exploiting the site-shared and spatial-temporal information in
   rs-fMRI data for multi-site ASD study.},

Abstract = {Objective Postoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) in children with intractable epilepsy has not been
   quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its value as a
   biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood. Methods In
   a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective
   resting-state seizure onset zone (SOZ)-targeted epilepsy surgery,
   postoperative resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was performed 6 to
   12 months later. Graded normalization of the postoperative resting-state
   SOZ was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical
   MRI characteristics. Results A total of 64 cases were evaluated.
   Network-targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs-fMRI
   normalization was significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with seizure
   reduction, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39
   cases with postoperative rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, 38 (97\%) became
   completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete
   rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5\%) became seizure free. The
   accuracy of rs-fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94\%,
   with 96\% sensitivity and 93\% specificity. Interpretation Among seizure
   localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, network-targeted surgery,
   followed by postoperative rs-fMRI normalization, has high correlation
   with seizure freedom. This study shows that rs-fMRI SOZ can be used as a
   biomarker of the epileptogenic zone, and postoperative rs-fMRI
   normalization is a biomarker for SOZ quiescence. ANN NEUROL 2019},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},

Volume = {176},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {To investigate a potential contribution of systemic physiology to
   recently reported BOLD fMRI signals in white matter, we compared
   photo-plethysmography (PPG) and whole-brain fMRI signals recorded
   simultaneously during long resting-state scans from an overnight sleep
   study. We found that intermittent drops in the amplitude of the PPG
   signal exhibited strong and widespread correlations with the fMRI
   signal, both in white matter (WM) and in gray matter (GM). The WM signal
   pattern resembled that seen in previous resting-state fMRI studies and
   closely tracked the location of medullary veins. Its temporal
   cross-correlation with the PPG amplitude was bipolar, with an early
   negative value. In GM, the correlation was consistently positive.
   Consistent with previous studies comparing physiological signals with
   fMRI, these findings point to a systemic vascular contribution to WM
   fMRI signals. The PPG drops are interpreted as systemic vasoconstrictive
   events, possibly related to intermittent increases in sympathetic tone
   related to fluctuations in arousal state. The counter-intuitive polarity
   of the WM signal is explained by long blood transit times in the
   medullary vasculature of WM, which cause blood oxygenation loss and a
   substantial timing mismatch between blood volume and blood oxygenation
   effects. A similar mechanism may explain previous findings of negative
   WM signals around large draining veins during both task-and
   resting-state fMRI.},

   Methods: EEG-fMRI from 18 patients was processed with conventional
   methods for BCG removal, while 9 patients used a MPT marker. IEDs were
   marked first without ECG information. In a second review, suspicious
   IEDs synchronous with the BCG were discarded. After each review, an
   event-related fMRI analysis was performed on the marked IEDs.
   Results: No difference was found in the proportion of suspicious IEDs in
   the 2 patient groups. However, the distribution of IED timings was
   significantly related to the cardiac cycle in 11 of 18 patients recorded
   without MPT marker, but only 2 of 9 patients with marker. In patients
   recorded without marker, failing to discard suspicious IEDs led to more
   inaccurate fMRI maps and more distant activations.
   Conclusions: BCG artifact correction based on MPT recordings allowed a
   more straightforward identification of IEDs that did not require ECG
   information in the large majority of patients.
   Significance: Marker-based ballistocardiographic artifact correction
   greatly facilitates the study of the generators of interictal discharges
   with EEG-fMRI. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (EEG-fMRI) is a unique and noninvasive method for investigating
   epileptic activity. Interictal epileptiform discharge-related EEG-fMRI
   provides cortical and subcortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   signal changes specific to epileptic discharges. As a result, EEG-fMRI
   has revealed insights into generators and networks involved in epileptic
   activity in different types of epilepsy, demonstrating-for instance-the
   implication of the thalamus in human generalized spike and wave
   discharges and the role of the default mode network in absences and
   focal epilepsy, and has suggested a mechanism for the
   cortico-subcortical interactions in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome discharges.
   EEG-fMRI can find deep sources of epileptic activity not available to
   scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography, and provides critical new
   information to delineate the epileptic focus when considering surgical
   treatment or electrode implantation. In recent years, methodological
   advances, such as artifact removal and automatic detection of events,
   have rendered this method easier to implement, and its clinical
   potential has since been established by evidence of the impact of BOLD
   response on clinical decision-making and of the relationship between
   concordance of BOLD responses with extent of resection and surgical
   outcome. This review presents the recent developments in EEG-fMRI
   methodology and EEG-fMRI studies in different types of epileptic
   disorders as follows: EEG-fMRI acquisition, gradient and pulse artifact
   removal, statistical analysis, clinical applications, presurgical
   evaluation, altered physiological state in generalized genetic epilepsy,
   and pediatric EEG-fMRI studies.},

Title = {Subspace-constrained approaches to low-rank fMRI acceleration},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {238},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Acceleration methods in fMRI aim to reconstruct high fidelity images
   from under-sampled k-space, allowing fMRI datasets to achieve higher
   temporal resolution, reduced physiological noise aliasing, and increased
   statistical degrees of freedom. While low levels of acceleration are
   typically part of standard fMRI protocols through parallel imaging,
   there exists the potential for approaches that allow much greater
   acceleration. One such existing approach is k-t FASTER, which exploits
   the inherent low-rank nature of fMRI. In this paper, we present a
   reformulated version of k-t FASTER which includes additional L2
   constraints within a low-rank framework. We evaluated the effect of
   three different constraints against existing low-rank approaches to fMRI
   reconstruction: Tikhonov constraints, low-resolution priors, and
   temporal subspace smoothness. The different approaches are separately
   tested for robustness to under-sampling and thermal noise levels, in
   both retrospectively and prospectively-undersampled finger-tapping task
   fMRI data. Reconstruction quality is evaluated by accurate
   reconstruction of low-rank subspaces and activation maps. The use of L2
   constraints was found to achieve consistently improved results,
   producing high fidelity reconstructions of statistical parameter maps at
   higher acceleration factors and lower SNR values than existing methods,
   but at a cost of longer computation time. In particular, the Tikhonov
   constraint proved very robust across all tested datasets, and the
   temporal subspace smoothness constraint provided the best reconstruction
   scores in the prospectively-undersampled dataset. These results
   demonstrate that regularized low-rank reconstruction of fMRI data can
   recover functional information at high acceleration factors without the
   use of any model-based spatial constraints.},

Year = {2017},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Neurologic disorders are characterized by abnormal cellular-,
   molecular-, and circuit-level functions in the brain. New methods to
   induce and control neuroplastic processes and correct abnormal function,
   or even shift functions from damaged tissue to physiologically healthy
   brain regions, hold the potential to dramatically improve overall
   health. Of the current neuroplastic interventions in development,
   neurofeedback training (NFT) from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (fMRI) has the advantages of being completely non-invasive,
   non-pharmacologic, and spatially localized to target brain regions, as
   well as having no known side effects. Furthermore, NFT techniques,
   initially developed using fMRI, can often be translated to exercises
   that can be performed outside of the scanner without the aid of medical
   professionals or sophisticated medical equipment. In fMRI NFT, the fMRI
   signal is measured from specific regions of the brain, processed, and
   presented to the participant in real-time. Through training,
   self-directed mental processing techniques, that regulate this signal
   and its underlying neurophysiologic correlates, are developed. FMRI NFT
   has been used to train volitional control over a wide range of brain
   regions with implications for several different cognitive, behavioral,
   and motor systems. Additionally, fMRI NFT has shown promise in a broad
   range of applications such as the treatment of neurologic disorders and
   the augmentation of baseline human performance. In this article, we
   present an fMRI NFT protocol developed at our institution for modulation
   of both healthy and abnormal brain function, as well as examples of
   using the method to target both cognitive and auditory regions of the
   brain.},

Abstract = {For decades, task functional magnetic resonance imaging has been a
   powerful noninvasive tool to explore the organizational architecture of
   human brain function. Researchers have developed a variety of brain
   network analysis methods for task fMRI data, including the general
   linear model, independent component analysis, and sparse representation
   methods. However, these shallow models are limited in faithful
   reconstruction and modeling of the hierarchical and temporal structures
   of brain networks, as demonstrated in more and more studies. Recently,
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit great ability of modeling
   hierarchical and temporal dependence features in the machine learning
   field, which might be suitable for task fMRI data modeling. To explore
   such possible advantages of RNNs for task fMRI data, we propose a novel
   framework of a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to model the
   functional brain networks from task fMRI data. Experimental results on
   the motor task fMRI data of Human Connectome Project 900 subjects
   release demonstrated that the proposed DRNN can not only faithfully
   reconstruct functional brain networks, but also identify more meaningful
   brain networks with multiple time scales which are overlooked by
   traditional shallow models. In general, this work provides an effective
   and powerful approach to identifying functional brain networks at
   multiple time scales from task fMRI data.},

Abstract = {In neuroimaging research, univariate analysis has always been used to
   localize ``representations{''} at the microscale, whereas network
   approaches have been applied to characterize transregional
   ``operations{''}. How are representations and operations linked through
   dynamic interactions? We developed the variational relevance evaluation
   (VRE) method to analyze individual task fMRI data, which selects
   informative voxels during model training to localize the
   ``representation{''}, and quantifies the dynamic contributions of single
   voxels across the whole-brain to different cognitive functions to
   characterize the ``operation{''}. Using 15 individual fMRI data files
   for higher visual area localizers, we evaluated the characterization of
   selected voxel positions of VRE and revealed different object-selective
   regions functioning in similar dynamics. Using another 15 individual
   fMRI data files for memory retrieval after offline learning, we found
   similar task-related regions working in different neural dynamics for
   tasks with diverse familiarities. VRE demonstrates a promising horizon
   in individual fMRI research.
   The variational relevance evaluation (VRE) method is developed to
   analyze individual task fMRI data and characterise task-specific neural
   interactions.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Neuroscientific investigations into communication phenomena using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are becoming increasingly
   popular in communication science. This presents opportunities for new
   discoveries, but also for the rapid spread of questionable practices.
   Here, we look to the future of fMRI in communication science: first,
   highlighting and advocating for several relatively new methods that
   should enable communication scholars to address novel research
   questions; and second, pointing out various controversies or pitfalls
   that exist in the use of several of the more widely used fMRI analysis
   methods within the field. Given the rapidly changing nature of the fMRI
   analysis landscape, such reflection is an essential part of being a good
   scholar in this domain. Our aim is to ensure that the future of fMRI in
   communication science is healthy, robust, and rich in variety, by
   encouraging all researchers in the field to think critically about the
   methods they use, whether that means adopting new analysis methods that
   can answer previously unanswerable questions, or adjusting their use of
   methods they already use to align with the latest recommended practices.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Graph-theoretical analysis is a novel tool to understand the
   organisation of the brain.We assessed whether altered graph theoretical
   parameters, as observed in multiple sclerosis (MS), reflect
   pathology-induced restructuring of the brain's functioning or result
   from a reduced signal quality in functional MRI (fMRI). In a cohort of
   49 people with MS and a matched group of 25 healthy subjects (HS), we
   performed a cognitive evaluation and acquired fMRI. From the fMRI
   measurement, Pearson correlation-based networks were calculated and
   graph theoretical parameters reflecting global and local brain
   organisation were obtained. Additionally, we assessed metrics of
   scanning quality (signal to noise ratio (SNR)) and fMRI signal quality
   (temporal SNR and contrast to noise ratio (CNR)). In accordance with the
   literature, we found that the network parameters were altered in MS
   compared to HS. However, no significant link was found with cognition.
   Scanning quality (SNR) did not differ between both cohorts. In contrast,
   measures of fMRI signal quality were significantly different and
   explained the observed differences in GTA parameters. Our results
   suggest that differences in network parameters between MS and HS in fMRI
   do not reflect a functional reorganisation of the brain, but rather
   occur due to reduced fMRI signal quality.},

Title = {A novel anesthesia regime enables neurofunctional studies and imaging

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized
   neuroscience by opening a unique window that allows neurocircuitry
   function and pathological alterations to be probed non-invasively across
   brain disorders. Here we report a novel sustainable anesthesia procedure
   for small animal neuroimaging that overcomes shortcomings of anesthetics
   commonly used in rodent fMRI. The significantly improved preservation of
   cerebrovascular dynamics enhances sensitivity to neural activity changes
   for which it serves as a proxy in fMRI readouts. Excellent
   cross-species/strain applicability provides coherence among preclinical
   findings and is expected to improve translation to clinical fMRI
   investigations. The novel anesthesia procedure based on the GABAergic
   anesthetic etomidate was extensively validated in fMRI studies conducted
   in a range of genetically engineered rodent models of autism and strains
   commonly used for transgenic manipulations. Etomidate proved effective,
   yielded long-term stable physiology with basal cerebral blood flow of
   similar to 0.5 ml/g/min and full recovery. Cerebrovascular
   responsiveness of up to 180\% was maintained as demonstrated with
   perfusion-and BOLD-based fMRI upon hypercapnic, pharmacological and
   sensory stimulation. Hence, etomidate lends itself as an
   anesthetic-of-choice for translational neuroimaging studies across
   rodent models of brain disorders.},

Abstract = {The development of highly accelerated fMRI acquisition techniques has
   led to novel possibilities to monitor cerebral activity non-invasively
   and with unprecedented temporal resolutions. With the emergence of
   dynamic connectivity and its ability to provide a much richer
   characterization of brain function compared to static measures, fast
   fMRI may yet play a crucial role in tracking dynamically varying
   networks. In spite of the dominance of slow hemodynamic contributions to
   the BOLD signal, high temporal sampling rates nevertheless improve the
   measurement of physiological noise, yielding an exceptional sensitivity
   for the detection of periods of transient connectivity at time scales of
   a few tens of seconds. There is also evidence that relevant BOLD
   fluctuations are detectable at high frequencies, implying that the
   benefits of fast fMRI extend beyond the ability to sample nuisance
   confounds. Here we review the latest technological advancements that
   have established fast fMRI as an effective acquisition technique, as
   well as its current and future implications on the analysis of dynamic
   networks.},

Title = {Subcortical evidence for a contribution of arousal to fMRI studies of
   brain activity},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {Cortical activity during periods of rest is punctuated by widespread,
   synchronous events in both electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals,
   but their behavioral relevance remains unclear. Here we report that
   these events correspond to momentary drops in cortical arousal and are
   associated with activity changes in the basal forebrain and thalamus.
   Combining fMRI and electrophysiology in macaques, we first establish
   that fMRI transients co-occur with spectral shifts in local field
   potentials (LFPs) toward low frequencies. Applying this knowledge to
   fMRI data from the human connectome project, we find that the fMRI
   transients are strongest in sensory cortices. Surprisingly, the positive
   cortical transients occur together with negative transients in focal
   subcortical areas known to be involved with arousal regulation, most
   notably the basal forebrain. This subcortical involvement, combined with
   the prototypical pattern of LFP spectral shifts, suggests that commonly
   observed widespread variations in fMRI cortical activity are associated
   with momentary drops in arousal.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most popular
   methods for studying the human brain. Task-related fMRI data processing
   aims to determine which brain areas are activated when a specific task
   is performed and is usually based on the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent
   (BOLD) signal. The background BOLD signal also reflects systematic
   fluctuations in regional brain activity which are attributed to the
   existence of resting-state brain networks. We propose a new fMRI data
   generating model which takes into consideration the existence of common
   task-related and resting-state components. We first estimate the common
   task-related temporal component, via two successive stages of
   generalized canonical correlation analysis and, then, we estimate the
   common task-related spatial component, leading to a task-related
   activation map. The experimental tests of our method with synthetic data
   reveal that we are able to obtain very accurate temporal and spatial
   estimates even at very low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which is usually
   the case in fMRI data processing. The tests with real-world fMRI data
   show significant advantages over standard procedures based on General
   Linear Models (GLMs).},

Title = {Probing responses to deep brain stimulation with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging},

Abstract = {Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for
   certain movement disorders and has additionally shown promise for
   various psychiatric, cognitive, and seizure disorders. However, the
   mechanisms through which stimulation exerts therapeutic effects are
   incompletely understood. A technique that may help to address this
   knowledge gap is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This is a
   non-invasive imaging tool which permits the observation of DBS effects
   in vivo.Objective: The objective of this review was to provide a
   comprehensive overview of studies in which fMRI during active DBS was
   performed, including studied disorders, stimulated brain regions,
   experimental designs, and the insights gleaned from stimulation-evoked
   fMRI responses.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published
   human studies in which fMRI was performed during active stimulation in
   DBS patients. The search was conducted using PubMED and MEDLINE.
   Results: The rate of fMRI DBS studies is increasing over time, with 37
   studies identified overall. The median number of DBS patients per study
   was 10 (range = 1-67, interquartile range = 11). Studies examined fMRI
   responses in various disease cohorts, including Parkinson's disease (24
   studies), essential tremor (3 studies), epilepsy (3 studies),
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (2 studies), pain (2 studies), Tourette
   syndrome (1 study), major depressive disorder, anorexia, and bipolar
   disorder (1 study), and dementia with Lewy bodies (1 study). The most
   commonly stimulated brain region was the subthalamic nucleus (24
   studies). Studies showed that DBS modulates large-scale brain networks,
   and that stimulation-evoked fMRI responses are related to the site of
   stimulation, stimulation parameters, patient characteristics, and
   therapeutic outcomes. Finally, a number of studies proposed fMRI-based
   biomarkers for DBS treatment, highlighting ways in which fMRI could be
   used to confirm circuit engagement and refine DBS therapy.Conclusion: A
   review of the literature reflects an exciting and expanding field,
   showing that the com-bination of DBS and fMRI represents a uniquely
   powerful tool for simultaneously manipulating and observing neural
   circuitry. Future work should focus on relatively understudied disease
   cohorts and stimulated regions, while focusing on the prospective
   validation of putative fMRI-based biomarkers.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Abstract = {Sequential dictionary learning algorithms have been successfully applied
   to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. fMRI data
   sets are, however, structured data matrices with the notions of temporal
   smoothness in the column direction. This prior information, which can be
   converted into a constraint of smoothness on the learned dictionary
   atoms, has seldomly been included in classical dictionary learning
   algorithms when applied to fMRI data analysis. In this paper, we tackle
   this problem by proposing two new sequential dictionary learning
   algorithms dedicated to fMRI data analysis by accounting for this prior
   information. These algorithms differ fromthe existing ones in their
   dictionary update stage. The steps of this stage are derived as a
   variant of the power method for computing the SVD. The proposed
   algorithms generate regularized dictionary atoms via the solution of a
   left regularized rank-one matrix approximation problem where temporal
   smoothness is enforced via regularization through basis expansion and
   sparse basis expansion in the dictionary update stage. Applications on
   synthetic data experiments and real fMRI data sets illustrating the
   performance of the proposed algorithms are provided.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate motor area mapping using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compared with electrical
   cortical stimulation (ECS). Motor mapping with fMRI and ECS were
   retrospectively compared in seven patients with refractory epilepsy in
   which the primary motor (M1) areas were identified by fMRI and ECS
   mapping between 2012 and 2019. A right finger tapping task was used for
   fMRI motor mapping. Blood oxygen level-dependent activation was detected
   in the left precentral gyrus (PreCG)/postcentral gyrus (PostCG) along
   the ``hand knob{''} of the central sulcus in all seven patients.
   Bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMAs) were also activated (n = 6),
   and the cerebellar hemisphere showed activation on the right side (n =
   3) and bilateral side (n = 4). Furthermore, the premotor area (PM) and
   posterior parietal cortex (PPC) were also activated on the left side (n
   = 1) and bilateral sides (n = 2). The M1 and sensory area (S1) detected
   by ECS included fMRI-activated PreCG/PostCG areas with broader extent.
   This study showed that fMRI motor mapping was locationally well
   correlated to the activation of M1/S1 by ECS, but the spatial extent was
   not concordant. In addition, the involvement of SMA, PM/PPC, and the
   cerebellum in simple voluntary movement was also suggested. Combination
   analysis of fMRI and ECS motor mapping contributes to precise
   localization of M1/S1.},

Title = {High-sensitivity detection of optogenetically-induced neural activity
   with functional ultrasound imaging},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {242},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Whole-brain imaging approaches and optogenetic manipulations are
   powerful tools to map brain-wide neural circuits in vivo. To date,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides the most
   comprehensive evaluation of such large-scale circuitry. However,
   functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) has recently emerged as a
   complementary imaging modality that can extend such measurements towards
   the context of diverse behavioral states and tasks. Nevertheless, in
   order to properly interpret the fUSI signal during these complicated
   scenarios, it must first be carefully validated against well-established
   technologies, such as fMRI, in highly controlled experimental settings.
   Here, to address this need, we compared subsequent fMRI and fUSI
   recordings in response to direct neuronal activation via optogenetics in
   the same animals under an identical anesthetic protocol. Specifically,
   we applied various intensities of light stimulation to the primary motor
   cortex (M1) of mice and compared the spatiotemporal dynamics of the
   elicited fMRI and fUSI signals. Overall, our general linear model
   analysis (t-scores) and time series analysis (z-scores) revealed that
   fUSI was more sensitive than fMRI for detecting optogenetically-induced
   neuronal activation. Local field potential recordings in the bilateral
   M1 and striatum also better co-localized with fUSI activation patterns
   than those of fMRI. Finally, the fUSI response contained distinct
   arterial and venous components that provide vascular readouts of
   neuronal activity with vessel-type specificity.},

Abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the
   cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological ``atoms{''}. Resting state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility
   of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous
   parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach
   detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These
   transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by
   histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity
   approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of
   spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar)
   rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random
   Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity
   approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition
   protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4
   previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations
   agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using
   histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal
   (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct
   computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest
   that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of
   brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications
   requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data.
   Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are
   publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/

Abstract = {Purpose of reviewThis review explores the potential of using novel
   imaging approaches to deepen our understanding of descending modulatory
   mechanisms in pain, focussing on functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) of the spinal cord and novel approaches to combining molecular
   and fMRI data. This review sheds light on the neural processes involved
   in pain modulation, paving the way for the development of targeted
   treatments.Recent findingsThe reviewed literature demonstrates
   significant advancements in pain research. Recent studies show the
   potential of using fMRI to investigate the spinal cord's role in pain
   modulation. Furthermore, novel analytical approaches integrating
   molecular and fMRI data show promise in elucidating the complex
   neurobiological processes underlying pain regulation. The main themes
   explored here include the identification of neurochemical markers
   associated with pain modulation and the characterisation of neural
   circuits involved in descending pain control.SummaryA comprehensive
   understanding of descending modulatory mechanisms in pain can inform the
   development of novel treatments, targeting dysfunction of these key
   pathways. By leveraging spinal fMRI and integrating molecular data into
   brain fMRI, researchers can identify potential therapeutic targets
   throughout the neuraxis. These advances may contribute to the
   development of personalised medicine approaches, allowing for tailored
   interventions based on individual pain profiles.},

Abstract = {Since the BRAIN Initiative and Human Brain Project began, a few efforts
   have been made to address the computational challenges of neuroscience
   Big Data. The promises of these two projects were to model the complex
   interaction of brain and behavior and to understand and diagnose brain
   diseases by collecting and analyzing large quanitites of data.
   Archiving, analyzing, and sharing the growing neuroimaging datasets
   posed major challenges. New computational methods and technologies have
   emerged in the domain of Big Data but have not been fully adapted for
   use in neuroimaging. In this work, we introduce the current challenges
   of neuroimaging in a big data context. We review our efforts toward
   creating a data management system to organize the large-scale fMRI
   datasets, and present our novel algorithms/methods for the distributed
   fMRI data processing that employs Hadoop and Spark. Finally, we
   demonstrate the significant performance gains of our algorithms/methods

Title = {Temporally constrained ICA with threshold and its application to fMRI
   data},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL IMAGING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JAN 17},
Abstract = {BackgroundAlthough independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely
   applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to reveal
   spatially independent brain networks, the order indetermination of ICA
   leads to the problem of target component selection. The temporally
   constrained independent component analysis (TCICA) is capable of
   automatically extracting the desired spatially independent components by
   adding the temporal prior information of the task to the mixing matrix
   for fMRI data analysis. However, the TCICA method can only extract a
   single component that tends to be a mix of multiple task-related
   components when there exist several independent components related to
   one task.MethodsIn this study, we proposed a TCICA with threshold
   (TCICA-Thres) method that performed TCICA outside the threshold and
   performed FastICA inside the threshold to automatically extract all the
   target components related to one task. The proposed approach was tested
   using simulated fMRI data and was applied to a real fMRI experiment
   using 13 subjects. Additionally, the performance of TCICA-Thres was
   compared with that of FastICA and TCICA.ResultsThe results from the
   simulation and the fMRI data demonstrated that TCICA-Thres better
   extracted the task-related components than TCICA. Moreover, TCICA-Thres
   outperformed FastICA in robustness to noise, spatial detection power and
   computational time.ConclusionsThe proposed TCICA-Thres solves the
   limitations of TCICA and extends the application of TCICA in fMRI data
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) bridge brain connectivity across timescales.
   During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain
   functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across
   modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained
   correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely
   unexplored. Here we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent
   FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed
   hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connlCA) framework
   to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state datasets (total 40 subjects).
   Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first
   component has a uniformly distributed EEG frequency fingerprint linked
   mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities.
   Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG
   frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI
   but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG. The first hybrid component
   suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span
   timescales, from millisecond range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG
   to second range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally
   exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two
   timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially
   independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state
   connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI
   over individuals.},

Abstract = {Reconstructing EEG sources involves a complex pipeline, with the inverse
   problem being the most challenging. Multiple inversion algorithms are
   being continuously developed, aiming to tackle the non-uniqueness of
   this problem, which has been shown to be partially circumvented by
   including prior information in the inverse models. Despite a few
   efforts, there are still current and persistent controversies regarding
   the inversion algorithm of choice and the optimal set of spatial priors
   to be included in the inversion models. The use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   data is one approach to tackle this problem. The spatial resolution of
   fMRI makes fMRI derived spatial priors very convenient for EEG
   reconstruction, however, only task activation maps and resting-state
   networks (RSNs) have been explored so far, overlooking the recent, but
   already accepted, notion that brain networks exhibit dynamic functional
   connectivity fluctuations. The lack of a systematic comparison between
   different source reconstruction algorithms, considering potentially more
   brain-informative priors such as fMRI, motivates the search for better
   reconstruction models. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data, here we
   compared four different inversion algorithms (minimum norm, MN; low
   resolution electromagnetic tomography, LORETA; empirical Bayes
   beamformer, EBB; and multiple sparse priors, MSP) under a Bayesian
   framework (as implemented in SPM), each with three different sets of
   priors consisting of: (1) those specific to the algorithm; (2) those
   specific to the algorithm plus fMRI task activation maps and RSNs; and
   (3) those specific to the algorithm plus fMRI task activation maps and
   RSNs and network modules of task-related dFC states estimated from the
   dFC fluctuations. The quality of the reconstructed EEG sources was
   quantified in terms of model-based metrics, namely the expectation of
   the posterior probability P(model|data) and variance explained of the
   inversion models, and the overlap/proportion of brain regions known to
   be involved in the visual perception tasks that the participants were
   submitted to, and RSN templates, with/within EEG source components.
   Model-based metrics suggested that model parsimony is preferred, with
   the combination MSP and priors specific to this algorithm exhibiting the
   best performance. However, optimal overlap/proportion values were found
   using EBB and priors specific to this algorithm and fMRI task activation
   maps and RSNs or MSP and considering all the priors (algorithm priors,
   fMRI task activation maps and RSNs and dFC state modules), respectively,
   indicating that fMRI spatial priors, including dFC state modules, might
   contain useful information to recover EEG source components reflecting
   neuronal activity of interest. Our main results show that providing fMRI
   spatial derived priors that reflect the dynamics of the brain might be
   useful to map neuronal activity more accurately from EEG-fMRI.
   Furthermore, this work paves the way towards a more informative
   selection of the optimal EEG source reconstruction approach, which may
   be critical in future studies.},

Abstract = {We wanted to verify the effect of combining multi-echo (ME) functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with slice acceleration in
   simultaneous multi-slice acquisition. The aim was to shed light on the
   benefits of multiple echoes for various acquisition settings, especially
   for levels of slice acceleration and flip angle. Whole-brain ME fMRI
   data were obtained from 26 healthy volunteers (using three echoes; seven
   runs with slice acceleration 1, 4, 6, and 8; and two different flip
   angles for each of the first three acceleration factors) and processed
   as single-echo (SE) data and ME data based on optimal combinations
   weighted by the contrast-to-noise ratio. Global metrics (temporal
   signal-to-noise ratio, signal-to-noise separation, number of active
   voxels, etc.) and local characteristics in regions of interest were used
   to evaluate SE and ME data. ME results outperformed SE results in all
   runs; the differences became more apparent for higher acceleration,
   where a significant decrease in data quality is observed. ME fMRI can
   improve the observed data quality metrics over SE fMRI for a wide range
   of accelerated fMRI acquisitions.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare localization of
   the language cortex using electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to establish the relevance
   of fMRI language mapping.
   Methods: Language mapping with fMRI and functional ECS mapping were
   retrospectively compared in ten patients with refractory epilepsy who
   underwent fMRI language mapping and functional ECS mapping between June
   2012 and April 2019. A shiritori task, a popular Japanese word chain
   game, was used for fMRI language mapping.
   Results: BOLD signal activation was observed in the left inferior
   frontal gyrus (including the pars opecularis and the pars triangularis),
   and superior temporal gyrus, which is a language-related area, as well
   as in the left superior and middle frontal gyri, the intraparietal
   sulcus, and fusiform gyrus. These results were compared with ECS to
   elucidate the functional role of the activated areas during fMRI
   language tasks. These activated areas included language areas, negative
   motor areas, supplementary motor areas (SMAs), and non-functional areas.
   Conclusion: The activated areas of fMRI language mapping include
   language-related areas, the negative motor area, and SMAs. These
   findings suggest the involvement of language and higher order motor
   networks in verbal expression. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   characteristic of fMRI data. Additionally, fMRI datasets have limited
   sample sizes, which significantly constrains the development of these
   methods. In this paper, we propose a novel brain effective connectivity
   estimation method based on causal autoencoder with meta -knowledge
   transfer, called MetaCAE. The proposed approach employs a causal
   autoencoder (CAE) to extract causal dependencies from non -stationary
   fMRI time series, and leverages meta -knowledge transfer to improve the
   estimation accuracy on small -sample data. More specifically, MetaCAE
   first employs a temporal convolutional encoder to extract non
   -stationary temporal information from fMRI time series. Then it uses a
   structural equation model -based decoder to decode causal relationships
   between brain regions. Finally, it utilizes a model -agnostic meta
   -learning method to learn the meta -knowledge of the shared brain
   effective connectivity among different subjects, and transfers the meta
   -knowledge to the CAE to enhance its estimation ability on small -sample
   fMRI data. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real -world
   data demonstrate the efficacy of MetaCAE in estimating brain effective
   connectivity.},

Title = {Temporal stability of fMRI in medetomidine-anesthetized rats},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Medetomidine has become a popular choice for anesthetizing rats during
   long-lasting sessions of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Despite this, it has not yet been
   thoroughly established how commonly reported fMRI readouts evolve over
   several hours of medetomidine anesthesia and how they are affected by
   the precise timing, dose, and route of administration. We used four
   different protocols of medetomidine administration to anesthetize rats
   for up to six hours and repeatedly evaluated somatosensory
   stimulus-evoked BOLD responses and resting state functional
   connectivity. We found that the temporal evolution of fMRI readouts
   strongly depended on the method of administration. Intravenous
   administration of a medetomidine bolus (0.05 mg/kg), combined with a
   subsequent continuous infusion (0.1 mg/kg/h), led to temporally stable
   measures of stimulus-evoked activity and functional connectivity
   throughout the anesthesia. Deviating from the above protocol-by omitting
   the bolus, lowering the medetomidine dose, or using the subcutaneous
   route-compromised the stability of these measures in the initial
   two-hour period. We conclude that both an appropriate protocol of
   medetomidine administration and a suitable timing of fMRI experiments
   are crucial for obtaining consistent results. These factors should be
   considered for the design and interpretation of future rat fMRI studies.},

Abstract = {Background
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a mainstream
   neuroimaging modality in the assessment of patients being evaluated for
   brain tumour and epilepsy surgeries. Thus, it is important for doctors
   in primary care settings to be well acquainted with the present and
   potential future applications, as well as limitations, of this modality.
   Objective
   The objective of this article is to introduce the theoretical principles
   and state-of-the-art clinical applications of fMRI in brain tumour and
   epilepsy surgery, with a focus on the implications for clinical primary
   care.
   Discussion
   fMRI enables non-invasive functional mapping of specific cortical tasks
   (eg motor, language, memory-based, visual), revealing information about
   functional localisation, anatomical variation in cortical function, and
   disease effects and adaptations, including the fascinating phenomenon of
   brain plasticity. fMRI is currently ordered by specialist neurologists
   and neurosurgeons for the purposes of pre-surgical assessment, and
   within the context of an experienced multidisciplinary team to prepare,
   conduct and interpret the scan. With an increasing number of patients
   undergoing fMRI, general practitioners can expect questions about the
   current and emerging role of fMRI in clinical care from these patients
   and their families.},

   functional magnetic resonance imaging},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Detecting neuroplasticity in global brain circuits in vivo is key for
   understanding myriad processes such as memory, learning, and recovery
   from injury. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is
   instrumental for such in vivo mappings, yet it typically relies on
   mapping changes in spatial extent of activation or via signal amplitude
   modulations, whose interpretation can be highly ambiguous. Importantly,
   a central aspect of neuroplasticity involves modulation of neural
   activity timing properties. We thus hypothesized that this temporal
   dimension could serve as a new marker for neuroplasticity. To detect
   fMRI signals more associated with the underlying neural dynamics, we
   developed an ultrafast fMRI (ufMRI) approach facilitating high
   spatiotemporal sensitivity and resolution in distributed neural
   pathways. When neuroplasticity was induced in the mouse visual pathway
   via dark rearing, ufMRI indeed mapped temporal modulations in the entire
   visual pathway. Our findings therefore suggest a new dimension for
   exploring neuroplasticity in vivo.},

Abstract = {Layer-dependent fMRI allows measurements of information flow in cortical
   circuits, as afferent and efferent connections terminate in different
   cortical layers. However, it is unknown to what level human fMRI is
   specific and sensitive enough to reveal directional functional activity
   across layers. To answer this question, we developed acquisition and
   analysis methods for blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and
   cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-based laminar fMRI and used these to
   discriminate four different tasks in the human motor cortex (M1). In
   agreement with anatomical data from animal studies, we found evidence
   for somatosensory and premotor input in superficial layers of M1 and for
   cortico-spinal motor output in deep layers. Laminar resting-state fMRI
   showed directional functional connectivity of M1 with somatosensory and
   premotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that CBV-fMRI can be used to
   investigate cortical activity in humans with unprecedented detail,
   allowing investigations of information flow between brain regions and
   outperforming conventional BOLD results that are often buried under
   vascular biases.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, many studies
   have been conducted on inter-subject variability as well as
   intra-subject reproducibility. These studies indicate that fMRI could
   have unique characteristics for individuals. In this study, we
   hypothesized that the dynamic information during 1 min of fMRI was
   unique and repetitive enough for each subject, so we applied long
   short-term memory (LSTM) using initial time points of dynamic
   resting-state fMRI for individual identification. Siamese network is
   used to obtain robust individual identification performance without
   additional learning on a new dataset. In particular, by adding a new
   structure called region of interest-wise average pooling (RAP),
   individual identification performance could be improved, and key
   intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) for individual identification
   were also identified. The average performance of individual
   identification was 97.88\% using the test dataset in eightfold
   cross-validation analysis. Through the visualization of features learned
   by Siamese LSTM with RAP, ICNs spanning the parietal region were
   observed as the key ICNs in identifying individuals. These results
   suggest the key ICNs in fMRI could represent individual uniqueness.},

Abstract = {The study of human olfaction is a highly complex and valuable field with
   applications ranging from biomedical research to clinical evaluation.
   Currently, evaluation of the functions of the human central olfactory
   system with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is still a
   challenge because of several technical difficulties. There are some
   significant variables to take into account when considering an effective
   method for mapping the function of the central olfactory system using
   fMRI, including proper odorant selection, the interaction between odor
   presentation and respiration, and potential anticipation of or
   habituation to odorants. An event-related, respiration-triggered
   olfactory fMRI technique can accurately administer odorants to stimulate
   the olfactory system while minimizing potential interference. It can
   effectively capture the precise onsets of fMRI signals in the primary
   olfactory cortex using our data post-processing method. The technique
   presented here provides an efficient and practical means for generating
   reliable olfactory fMRI results. Such a technique can ultimately be
   applied in the clinical realm as a diagnostic tool for diseases
   associated with olfactory degeneration, including Alzheimer's and
   Parkinson's disease, as we begin to further understand the complexities
   of the human olfactory system.},

Title = {Can fMRI discriminate between deception and false memory? A
   meta-analytic comparison between deception and false memory studies},
Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {43-55},

Abstract = {Previous research has highlighted the potential of fMRI in
   discriminating between truth and falsehood. However, falsehoods may not
   necessarily represent a deliberate intention to deceive; they can be a
   result of false memory too. It is important to show that fMRI can
   discriminate between deception and false memory, before it can be
   applied in legal contexts for deception detection. To this end, we
   performed a meta-analytic comparison of brain activation between
   deception and false memory. Activation likelihood estimation
   meta-analyses were conducted separately on 49 deception (61 contrasts;
   N-total = 991) and 28 false memory (32 contrasts; N-total = 484)
   studies. The contrasts obtained from these meta-analyses were entered
   into subsequent conjunction and contrast analyses. Deception and false
   memory tasks activated several frontoparietal regions. Both tasks
   activated the left superior frontal gyrus. Deception, relative to false
   memory, was associated with increased activation in the right superior
   temporal gyrus, right insula, left inferior parietal lobule and right
   superior frontal gyros. These results provide some evidence to suggest
   that fMRI can discriminate between deception and false memory.},

Title = {Spatial signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression differ
   between primates and rodents},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {During deep anesthesia, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the
   brain alternates between bursts of activity and periods of relative
   silence (suppressions). The origin of burst-suppression and its
   distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas
   involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian
   species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At
   first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human
   EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found
   distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The
   burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in
   rats, the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in
   primates most sensory areas were excluded-predominantly the primary
   visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI
   signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies
   investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression
   in unconscious states.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Brain imaging technology is an important means to study brain diseases.
   The commonly used brain imaging technologies are fMRI and EEG. Clinical
   practice has shown that although fMRI is superior to EEG in observing
   the anatomical details of some diseases that are difficult to diagnose,
   its costs are prohibitive. In particular, more and more patients who use
   metal implants cannot use this technology. In contrast, EEG technology
   is easier to implement. Therefore, to break through the limitations of
   fMRI technology, we propose a brain imaging modality transfer framework,
   namely BMT-GAN, based on a generative adversarial network. The framework
   introduces a new non-adversarial loss to reduce the perception and style
   difference between input and output images. It also realizes the
   conversion from EEG modality data to fMRI modality data and provides
   comprehensive reference information of EEG and fMRI for radiologists.
   Finally, a qualitative and quantitative comparison with the existing
   GAN-based brain imaging modality transfer approaches demonstrates the
   superiority of our framework.},

Title = {Canonical EEG microstates transitions reflect switching among BOLD
   resting state networks and predict fMRI signal},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates (MSs), which reflect
   a large topographical representation of coherent electrophysiological
   brain activity, are widely adopted to study cognitive processes
   mechanisms and aberrant alterations in brain disorders. MS topographies
   are quasi-stable lasting between 60-120 ms. Some evidence suggests that
   MS are the electrophysiological signature of resting-state networks
   (RSNs). However, the spatial and functional interpretation of MS and
   their association with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   remains unclear. Approach. In a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 52), we
   conducted several statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches
   analyses on the association among MS spatio-temporal dynamics and the
   blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) simultaneous EEG-fMRI data
   using statistical and ML approaches. Main results. Our results using a
   generalized linear model showed that MS transitions were largely and
   negatively associated with BOLD signals in the somatomotor, visual,
   dorsal attention, and ventral attention fMRI networks with limited
   association within the default mode network. Additionally, a novel
   recurrent neural network (RNN) confirmed the association between MS
   transitioning and fMRI signal while revealing that MS dynamics can model
   BOLD signals and vice versa. Significance. Results suggest that MS
   transitions may represent the deactivation of fMRI RSNs and provide
   evidence that both modalities measure common aspects of undergoing brain
   neuronal activities. These results may help to better understand the
   electrophysiological interpretation of MS.},

Title = {Active pain coping is associated with the response in real-time fMRI
   neurofeedback during pain},
Journal = {BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {712-721},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback
   is used as a tool to gain voluntary control of activity in various brain
   regions. Little emphasis has been put on the influence of cognitive and
   personality traits on neurofeedback efficacy and baseline activity.
   Here, we assessed the effect of individual pain coping on rt-fMRI
   neurofeedback during heat-induced pain. Twenty-eight healthy subjects
   completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) prior to scanning.
   The first part of the fMRI experiment identified target regions using
   painful heat stimulation. Then, subjects were asked to down-regulate the
   pain target brain region during four neurofeedback runs with painful
   heat stimulation. Functional MRI analysis included correlation analysis
   between fMRI activation and pain ratings as well as CSQ ratings. At the
   behavioral level, the active pain coping (first principal component of
   CSQ) was correlated with pain ratings during neurofeedback. Concerning
   neuroimaging, pain sensitive regions were negatively correlated with
   pain coping. During neurofeedback, the pain coping was positively
   correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal
   cortex, hippocampus and visual cortex. Thermode temperature was
   negatively correlated with anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex activation. In conclusion, self-reported pain coping mechanisms
   and pain sensitivity are a source of variance during rt-fMRI
   neurofeedback possibly explaining variations in regulation success. In
   particular, active coping seems to be associated with successful pain
   regulation.},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Sensory perception is neither static nor simple. The senses influence
   each other during multisensory stimulation and can be both suppressive
   and super-additive. As most knowledge of human olfactory perception is
   derived from functional neuroimaging studies, in particular fMRI, our
   current understanding of olfactory perception has systematically been
   investigated in an environment with concurrent loud sounds. To date, the
   confounding effects of acoustic fMRI-noise during scanning on olfactory
   perception have not yet been investigated. In this study we investigate
   how acoustic noise derived from the rapid switching of MR gradient
   coils, affects olfactory perception. For this, 50 subjects were tested
   in both a silent setting and an fMRI-noise setting, in a randomised
   order. We found that fMRI-related acoustic noise had a significant
   negative effect on the olfactory detection threshold score. No
   significant effects were identified on olfactory discrimination,
   identification, identification certainty, hedonic rating, or intensity
   rating. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The potential of real-time fMRI neurofeedback for stroke rehabilitation:
   A systematic review},
Journal = {CORTEX},

Volume = {107},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback
   aids the modulation of neural functions by training self-regulation of
   brain activity through operant conditioning. This technique has been
   applied to treat several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
   disorders, but its effectiveness for stroke rehabilitation has not been
   examined yet. Here, we systematically review the effectiveness of
   rt-fMRI neurofeedback training in modulating motor and cognitive
   processes that are often impaired after stroke. Based on predefined
   search criteria, we selected and examined 33 rt-fMRI neurofeedback
   studies, including 651 healthy individuals and 15 stroke patients in
   total. The results of our systematic review suggest that rt-fMRI
   neurofeedback training can lead to a learned modulation of brain
   signals, with associated changes at both the neural and the behavioural
   level. However, more research is needed to establish how its use can be
   optimized in the context of stroke rehabilitation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {An fMRI dataset for whole-body somatotopic mapping in humans},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {The somatotopic representation of the body is a well-established
   organizational principle in the human brain. Classic invasive direct
   electrical stimulation for somatotopic mapping cannot be used to map the
   whole-body topographical representation of healthy individuals.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an indispensable
   tool for the noninvasive investigation of somatotopic organization of
   the human brain using voluntary movement tasks. Unfortunately, body
   movements during fMRI scanning often cause large head motion artifacts.
   Consequently, there remains a lack of publicly accessible fMRI datasets
   for whole-body somatotopic mapping. Here, we present public
   high-resolution fMRI data to map the somatotopic organization based on
   motor movements in a large cohort of healthy adults (N = 62). In
   contrast to previous studies that were mostly designed to distinguish
   few body representations, most body parts are considered, including toe,
   ankle, leg, finger, wrist, forearm, upper arm, jaw, lip, tongue, and
   eyes. Moreover, the fMRI data are denoised by combining spatial
   independent component analysis with manual identification to clean
   artifacts from head motion associated with body movements.},

Abstract = {Serotonin-producing neurons profusely innervate brain regions via
   long-range projections. However, it remains unclear whether and how
   endogenous serotonergic transmission specifically influences regional or
   global functional activity. We combined designed receptors exclusively
   activated by designed drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetics and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), an approach we term ``chemo-fMRI,''
   to causally probe the brain-wide substrates modulated by endogenous
   serotonergic activity. We describe the generation of a conditional
   knockin mouse line that, crossed with serotonin-specific Cre-recombinase
   mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic neurons during fMRI
   scans. We show that endogenous stimulation of serotonin-producing
   neurons does not affect global brain activity but results in
   region-specific activation of a set of primary target regions
   encompassing corticohippocampal and ventrostriatal areas. By contrast,
   pharmacological boosting of serotonin levels produced widespread fMRI
   deactivation, plausibly reflecting the mixed contribution of central and
   perivascular constrictive effects. Our results identify the primary
   functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation and establish
   causation between activation of serotonergic neurons and regional fMRI
   signals.},

Abstract = {Although declarative concepts (e.g., apple) have been shown to be
   identifiable from their functional MRI (fMRI) signatures, the
   correspondence has yet to be established for executing a complex
   procedure such as tying a knot. In this study, 7 participants were
   trained to tie seven knots. Their neural representations of these seven
   procedures were assessed with fMRI as they imagined tying each knot. A
   subset of the trained participants physically tied each knot in a later
   fMRI session. Findings demonstrated that procedural knowledge of tying a
   particular knot can be reliably identified from its fMRI signature, and
   such procedural signatures were found here in frontal, parietal, motor,
   and cerebellar regions. In addition, a classifier trained on mental
   tying signatures was able to reliably identify when participants were
   planning to tie knots before they physically tied them, which suggests
   that the mental-tying and physical-tying procedural signatures are
   similar. These findings indicate that fMRI activation patterns can
   illuminate the representation and organization of procedural knowledge.},

Abstract = {Increased glucose metabolism and decreased low-frequency fluctuation
   have been consistently reported in the motor area of Parkinson's disease
   (PD). The reason for such seeming paradox is unclear. Here, we enrolled
   34 PD patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) for hybrid PET/fMRI scan
   (PET/fMRI((discovery)) dataset). In addition, 2 replication datasets,
   namely fMRI((validation-1)) and fMRI((validation-2)) dataset, were also
   included. We computed ratio of standard uptake value (SUVr) to measure
   FDG-uptake. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for the
   following 4 frequency bands was calculated: slow-5, slow-4, slow-3, and
   slow-2. We obtained a significant group-by-frequency interaction effect
   of ALFF in the paracentral lobule/supplementary motor area (P-FWE =
   0.003) and the right sensorimotor area (P-FWE < 0.001) in the
   PET/fMRI((discovery)) dataset, which could be replicated using
   fMRI((validation-1)) and fMRI((validation-2)) datasets (P-FWE < 0.05).
   In detail, HCs exhibited power law-like fluctuation pattern, but PD
   patients did not. Correlation analyses further revealed significant
   associations between ALFF and FDG-uptake in HCs (P-values < 0.031), but
   not in PD (P-values > 0.28). Taken together, this study identified a
   fluctuation shift over frequency effect in PD patients, which further
   disassociated with glucose metabolism in the motor cortex.},

Title = {Risk assessment of aggressive behavior in Chinese patients with
   schizophrenia by fMRI and <i>COMT</i> gene},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {387-395},
Abstract = {Background: Blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (BOLD-fMRI) maps cerebral activity by the hemodynamic response.
   Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is involved in the metabolism
   of dopamine. It is reported that both of these can be used to assess the
   aggression risk in patients with schizophrenia. However, these methods
   to assess the aggression risk patients with schizophrenia have not been
   established in China. Therefore, we deliver here a systematic review and
   meta-analysis based on the studies dealing with Chinese patients.
   Method: Nine fMRI studies and 12 gene studies were included. The data of
   each study were extracted and summarized. Odds ratios with 95\%
   confidence intervals were estimated on allele, dominant, and recessive
   models. Publication bias was evaluated by Begg's funnel plot.
   Results: Positive BOLD-fMRI values in the lower central neural system
   (CNS) and negative values in the high-level CNS were observed in the
   patients with aggression risk. A strong association was derived from the
   recessive gene model of COMT polymorphism rs4680 and risk in aggression
   behavior (odds ratio = 2.10). No significant publication bias was
   identified.
   Conclusion: Aggression behavior in patients with schizophrenia can be
   indicated by positive BOLD-fMRI values in the lower CNS and negative
   values in the high-level CNS and by a recessive gene model in COMT
   polymorphism rs4680. A combined test of fMRI and COMT gene could
   increase the predictive value.},

Abstract = {Given the strong evidence for neurological alterations at the basis of
   drug dependence, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) represents
   an important tool in the clinical neuroscience of addiction. fMRI
   cue-reactivity paradigms represent an ideal platform to probe the
   involvement of neurobiological pathways subserving the reward/motivation
   system in addiction and potentially offer a translational mechanism by
   which interventions and behavioral predictions can be tested. Thus, this
   review summarizes the research that has applied fMRI cue-reactivity
   paradigms to the study of adult substance use disorder treatment
   responses. Studies utilizing fMRI cue-reactivity paradigms for the
   prediction of relapse and as a means to investigate psychosocial and
   pharmacological treatment effects on cue-elicited brain activation are
   presented within four primary categories of substances: alcohol,
   nicotine, cocaine and opioids. Lastly, suggestions for how to leverage
   fMRI technology to advance addiction science and treatment development

Title = {Methodological considerations in assessment of language lateralisation
   with fMRI: a systematic review},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {The involvement of the right and left hemispheres in mediating language
   functions has been measured in a variety of ways over the centuries
   since the relative dominance of the left hemisphere was first known.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) presents a useful
   non-invasive method of assessing lateralisation that is being
   increasingly used in clinical practice and research. However, the
   methods used in the fMRI laterality literature currently are highly
   variable, making systematic comparisons across studies difficult. Here
   we consider the different methods of quantifying and classifying
   laterality that have been used in fMRI studies since 2000, with the aim
   of determining which give the most robust and reliable measurement.
   Recommendations are made with a view to informing future research to
   increase standardisation in fMRI laterality protocols. In particular,
   the findings reinforce the importance of threshold-independent methods
   for calculating laterality indices, and the benefits of assessing
   heterogeneity of language laterality across multiple regions of interest
   and tasks.},

   motor recovery in subacute stroke: A longitudinal task-related fMRI
   study},
Journal = {CORTEX},

Pages = {80-98},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Motor hand deficits impact autonomy in everyday life, and
   neuroplasticity processes of motor recovery can be explored using
   functional MRI (fMRI). However, few studies have used fMRI to explore
   the mechanisms underlying hand recovery following stroke. Based on the
   dual visuomotor model positing that two segregated dorsomedial and
   dorsolateral cerebral networks control reach and grasp movements, we
   explored the relationship between motor task-related activity in the
   sensorimotor network and hand recovery following stroke.
   Behavioral recovery was explored with a handgrip force task assessing
   simple grasp, and a visuomotor reaching and precise grasping task, the
   Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). We used a passive wrist flexion-extension
   task to measure fMRI activity in 36 sensorimotor brain areas. Behavioral
   and fMRI measurements were performed in 27 patients (53.2 +/- 9.5 years)
   1-month following stroke, and then 6-month and 24-month later. The
   effects of sensorimotor activity on hand recovery were analyzed using
   correlations and linear mixed models (LMMs).
   PPT and handgrip force correlated with fMRI activity measures in the
   sensorimotor and parietal areas. PPT recovery was modeled by fMRI
   measures in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (MI-4p), superior
   parietal lobule (SPL-7M) and parietal operculum OP1, and lesion side.
   Handgrip force was modeled by ipsilesional MI-4a, OP1, and
   contralesional inferior parietal lobule (IPL-PFt). Moreover, the
   relationship between fMRI activity and hand recovery was time-dependent,
   occurring in the early recovery period in SPL-BA-7M, and later in MI.
   These results suggest that areas of both dorsolateral and dorsomedial
   networks participate to visuomotor reach and grasp tasks (PPT), while
   dorsolateral network areas may control recovery of simple grasp
   (handgrip force), suggesting that the type of movement modulates network
   recruitment. We also found functional dissociations between MI-4p
   related to PPT that required independent finger movements and MI-4a
   related to simple grasp without independent finger movements. These
   findings need to be replicated in further studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study aimed to (1) evaluate the effects of an empathy education
   program, and (2) explore functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as
   a potential empathy assessment tool. An empathy enhancement program for
   premedical students was developed. The Korean version of the Jefferson
   Scale of Empathy-Student version (JSE-S) and Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index (K-IRI) were used to measure self-assessed changes in empathy.
   Clinical vignettes demonstrating empathy tasks were presented to
   participants undergoing fMRI, to assess regional changes in the brain.
   Self-reported empathy scores and brain activity signals using fMRI from
   before and after the program were compared. The JSE-S total and
   perspective taking scores significantly increased after the program.
   Data from the fMRI revealed noticeable differences in cognitive regions
   associated with empathy, namely the right superior medial frontal gyrus
   and left precentral gyrus. This study results support the prior evidence
   of positive impact of empathy education. In addition, the authors
   suggest that brain fMRI might be used in measuring the effectiveness of
   empathy education.},

Abstract = {We introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) approach to account
   for temporal dynamics and dependencies in brain networks observed via
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our approach directly
   parameterizes temporal dynamics through recurrent connections, which can
   be used to formulate blind source separation with a conditional (rather
   than marginal) independence assumption, which we call RNN-ICA. This
   formulation enables us to visualize the temporal dynamics of both first
   order (activity) and second order (directed connectivity) information in
   brain networks that are widely studied in a static sense, but not
   well-characterized dynamically. RNN-ICA predicts dynamics directly from
   the recurrent states of the RNN in both task and resting state fMRI. Our
   results show both task-related and group-differentiating directed
   connectivity.},

Abstract = {Blood-level oxygenation-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) is the most common modality to study functional
   connectivity in the human brain. Most research to date has focused on
   connectivity between pairs of brain regions. However, attention has
   recently turned towards connectivity involving more than two regions,
   that is, higher-order connectivity. It is not yet clear how higher-order
   connectivity can best be quantified. The measures that are currently in
   use cannot distinguish between pairwise (i.e., second-order) and
   higher-order connectivity. We show that genuine higher-order
   connectivity can be quantified by using multivariate cumulants. We
   explore the use of multivariate cumulants for quantifying higher-order
   connectivity and the performance of block bootstrapping for statistical
   inference. In particular, we formulate a generative model for fMRI
   signals exhibiting higher-order connectivity and use it to assess bias,
   standard errors, and detection probabilities. Application to
   resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project demonstrates
   that spontaneous fMRI signals are organized into higher-order networks
   that are distinct from second-order resting-state networks. Application
   to a clinical cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis further
   demonstrates that cumulants can be used to classify disease groups and
   explain behavioral variability. Hence, we present a novel framework to
   reliably estimate genuine higher-order connectivity in fMRI data which
   can be used for constructing hyperedges, and finally, which can readily
   be applied to fMRI data from populations with neuropsychiatric disease
   or cognitive neuroscientific experiments.
   We introduce and assess the performance of higher-order functional
   connectivity metrics using multivariate cumulants for resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These metrics
   quantify connectivity that cannot be explained by pairwise Pearson
   correlations. Using a generative model we assess the bias, standard
   errors and detection probabilities in individual and group level data.
   Application to resting-state fMRI data demonstrates that spontaneous
   fMRI signals are organized into higher-order networks that are distinct
   from the conventional resting-state networks. Furthermore, higher-order
   connectivity captured relevant non-redundant information in a clinical
   cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis. image},

   provides a robust methodology for imaging the brain across cortical
   depths and columns that provides insights into the brain's organization

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the blood oxygen
   level dependent (BOLD) contrast has gained a prominent position in
   neuroscience for imaging neuronal activity and studying effective brain
   connectivity under working state and functional connectivity at resting
   state. However, the fundamental questions in regards to fMRI technology:
   how the BOLD signal inferences the underlying microscopic neuronal
   activity and physiological changes and what is the ultimate specificity
   of fMRI for functional mapping of microcircuits, remain unanswered. The
   capability of simultaneous fMRI measurement and functional microscopic
   imaging in a live brain thus holds the key to link the microscopic and
   mesoscopic neural dynamics to the macroscopic brain activity at the
   central nervous system level. Here we report the first demonstration to
   integrate high-resolution two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPM) with
   a 16.4 tesla MRI system, which proves the concept and feasibility for
   performing simultaneous high-resolution fMRI and TPM imaging at
   ultrahigh magnetic field.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study the
   neural bases of cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease for several
   years. Traditionally, task-based fMRI has been applied to study specific
   cognitive functions, providing information on disease-related
   alterations and regarding the physiological bases of normal cognition,
   the dopaminergic system, and the frontostriatal circuits. More recently,
   functional connectivity techniques using resting-state fMRI data have
   been developed. Unconstrained by specific cognitive tasks, these
   techniques allow assessing whole-brain patterns of connectivity believed
   to be useful proxies for the underlying functional architecture of the
   brain. These methods have shown that different types of Parkinson's
   disease-related cognitive deficits are associated with patterns of
   altered connectivity within and between resting-state intrinsic
   connectivity networks. Although methodological standardization and the
   vulnerability of fMRI techniques to artifacts mandate further technical
   refinement, early studies provide encouraging results regarding the
   potential of fMRI-derived parameters for the ultimate goal of
   individual-subject classification.},

Title = {Detecting Alzheimer's disease Based on 4D fMRI: An exploration under

Abstract = {Applying machine learning methods to various modality medical images and
   clinical data for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its
   prodromal stage has many significant results. So far, the image data
   input to classifier mainly focus on 2D or 3D images. Although some
   functional imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), generate 4D data which contain both spatial and
   time-varying information of the brain, for the lack of suitable 4D image
   processing algorithm, these 4D data were always used by transforming
   them into functional connectivity or slicing them into 2D/3D pictures
   which causing apparent information loss. In this paper, we present a 4D
   deep learning model (C3d-LSTM) for AD discrimination, which is able to
   utilize the spatial and time-varying information simultaneously by
   dealing with 4D fMRI data directly. The proposed C3d-LSTM combines a
   series of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial
   features from each volume of 3D static image in fMRI image sequence.
   Then the feature maps obtained were put into the long short-term memory
   (LSTM) network to capture the time-varying information contained in the
   data. Because of the design of structure, C3d-LSTM became an end-to-end
   data-driven model, which was more convenient for processing 4D fMRI
   data. The model proposed conducted on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative
   dataset for algorithm evaluation compared with controlled experiments.
   Results showed that using 4D fMRI data directly with the proposed method
   did make a far better result for AD detection than the methods using
   functional connectivity, 2D, or 3D fMRI data. It demonstrated our
   assumption that making the most of the natural spatial and temporal
   information preserved in 4D fMRI data is significant for AD detection
   and can increase the performance of the classifier. Meanwhile the result
   implied that the C3d-LSTM model proposed is a suitable model for
   processing 4D fMRI data and extracting the spatio-temporal property of
   fMRI data fully for diagnosis of AD. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Increased left inferior fronto-striatal activation during error
   monitoring after fMRI neurofeedback of right inferior frontal cortex in
   adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a self-regulation
   disorder, with impairments in error monitoring associated with
   underactivation of the related brain network(s). Psychostimulant
   medication improves ADHD symptoms and can upregulate brain function, but
   has side effects, with limbed evidence for longer-term effects.
   Real-time functional magnetic resonance neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has
   potential longer-term neuroplastic effects. We previously reported the
   effects of 11 runs of 8.5 min of fMRI-NF of the right inferior frontal
   cortex (rIFC) in adolescents with ADHD. This resulted in improvement of
   clinical symptom and enhanced rIFC activation post-pre treatment during
   response inhibition, when compared to a control group receiving fMRI-NF
   of the left parahippocampal gyrus (lPHG).
   In the current study we applied a novel analysis to the existing data by
   investigating the effects of fMRI-NF of rIFC in 16 adolescents with ADHD
   compared to fMRI-NF of lPHG in 11 adolescents with ADHD on the
   neurofunctional correlates of error monitoring during the same fMRI
   tracking stop task and potential associations with cognitive and
   clinical measures. We found stronger performance adjustment to errors in
   the rIFC-NF compared to the control lPHG-NF group. At the brain function
   level, fMRI-NF of rIFC compared to that of lPHG was associated with
   increased activation in error monitoring regions of the left IFC,
   premotor cortex, insula and putamen. The increased activation in left
   IFC-insular-striatal error monitoring regions in the rIFC-NF relative to
   the lPHG-NF group was furthermore trend-wise correlated with NF-induced
   ADHD symptom improvements.
   The findings of this study show, that during error monitoring, fMRI-NF
   training of rIFC upregulation elicited improvement in post-error
   behavioural adjustments and concomitant increased activation in left
   hemispheric fronto-insular-striatal and premotor regions mediating
   self-control and self-monitoring functions. This suggests that the
   administration of fMRI-NF of the rIFC may have had an impact on wider
   networks of self-regulation and self-monitoring in adolescents with
   ADHD.},

Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {152-166},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {When performing statistical analysis of single-subject fMRI data, serial
   correlations need to be taken into account to allow for valid inference.
   Otherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be
   under-estimated resulting in increased false-positive rates. Serial
   correlations in fMRI data are commonly characterized in terms of a
   first-order autoregressive (AR) process and then removed via
   pre-whitening. The required noise model for the pre-whitening depends on
   a number of parameters, particularly the repetition time (TR). Here we
   investigate how the sub-second temporal resolution provided by
   simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging changes the noise structure in
   fMRI time series. We fit a higher-order AR model and then estimate the
   optimal AR model order for a sequence with a TR of less than 600 ms
   providing whole brain coverage. We show that physiological noise
   modelling successfully reduces the required AR model order, but
   remaining serial correlations necessitate an advanced noise model. We
   conclude that commonly used noise models, such as the AR(1) model, are
   inadequate for modelling serial correlations in fMRI using sub-second
   TRs. Rather, physiological noise modelling in combination with advanced
   pre-whitening schemes enable valid inference in single-subject analysis
   using fast fMRI sequences.},

Title = {Methodology for tDCS integration with fMRI},

Abstract = {Understanding and reducing variability of response to transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) requires measuring what factors
   predetermine sensitivity to tDCS and tracking individual response to
   tDCS. Human trials, animal models, and computational models suggest
   structural traits and functional states of neural systems are the major
   sources of this variance. There are 118 published tDCS studies (up to
   October 1, 2018) that used fMRI as a proxy measure of neural activation
   to answer mechanistic, predictive, and localization questions about how
   brain activity is modulated by tDCS. FMRI can potentially contribute as:
   a measure of cognitive state-level variance in baseline brain activation
   before tDCS; inform the design of stimulation montages that aim to
   target functional networks during specific tasks; and act as an outcome
   measure of functional response to tDCS. In this systematic review, we
   explore methodological parameter space of tDCS integration with fMRI
   spanning: (a) fMRI timing relative to tDCS (pre, post, concurrent); (b)
   study design (parallel, crossover); (c) control condition (sham, active
   control); (d) number of tDCS sessions; (e) number of follow up scans;
   (f) stimulation dose and combination with task; (g) functional imaging
   sequence (BOLD, ASL, resting); and (h) additional behavioral (cognitive,
   clinical) or quantitative (neurophysiological, biomarker) measurements.
   Existing tDCS-fMRI literature shows little replication across these
   permutations; few studies used comparable study designs. Here, we use a
   representative sample study with both task and resting state fMRI before
   and after tDCS in a crossover design to discuss methodological
   confounds. We further outline how computational models of current flow
   should be combined with imaging data to understand sources of
   variability. Through the representative sample study, we demonstrate how
   modeling and imaging methodology can be integrated for individualized
   analysis. Finally, we discuss the importance of conducting tDCS-fMRI
   with stimulation equipment certified as safe to use inside the MR
   scanner, and of correcting for image artifacts caused by tDCS. tDCS-fMRI
   can address important questions on the functional mechanisms of tDCS
   action (e.g., target engagement) and has the potential to support
   enhancement of behavioral interventions, provided studies are designed
   rationally.},

Abstract = {Cognitive impairment indicates disturbed brain physiology which can be
   due to various mechanisms including Alzheimer's pathology. Combined
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography
   (EEG) recordings (EEG-fMRI) can assess the interplay between
   complementary measures of brain activity and EEG changes to be localized
   to specific brain regions. We used a two-step approach, where we first
   examined changes related to a syndrome of mild cognitive impairment
   irrespective of pathology and then studied the specific impact of
   amyloid pathology. After detailed clinical and neuropsychological
   characterization as well as a positron emission tomography (PET) scans
   with the tracer 11-{[}C]-Pittsburgh Compound B to estimate cerebral
   amyloid deposition, 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   (mean age 75.6 SD: 8.9) according to standard criteria and 21
   cognitively healthy controls (HCS) (mean age 71.8 SD: 4.2) were assessed
   with EEG-fMRI. Thalamo-cortical alpha-fMRI signal coupling was only
   observed in HCS. Additional EEG-fMRI signal coupling differences between
   HCS and MCI were observed in parts of the default mode network, salience
   network, fronto-parietal network, and thalamus. Individuals with
   significant cerebral amyloid deposition (amyloid-positive MCI and HCS
   combined compared to amyloid-negative HCS) displayed abnormal EEG-fMRI
   signal coupling in visual, fronto-parietal regions but also in the
   parahippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum. This finding was paralleled
   by stronger absolute fMRI signal in the parahippocampus and weaker
   absolute fMRI signal in the inferior frontal gyrus in amyloid-positive
   subjects. We conclude that the thalamocortical coupling in the alpha
   band in HCS more closely reflects previous findings observed in younger
   adults, while in MCI there is a clearly aberrant coupling in several
   networks dominated by an anticorrelation in the posterior cingulate
   cortex. While these findings may broadly indicate physiological changes
   in MCI, amyloid pathology was specifically associated with abnormal fMRI
   signal responses and disrupted coupling between brain oscillations and
   fMRI signal responses, which especially involve core regions of memory:
   the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal cortex.},

Abstract = {High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is becoming
   increasingly popular because of the growing availability of ultra-high
   magnetic fields which are capable of improving sensitivity and spatial
   resolution. However, it is debatable whether increased spatial
   resolutions for haemodynamic-based techniques, like fMRI, can accurately
   detect the true location of neuronal activity. We have addressed this
   issue in functional columns and layers of animals with haemoglobin-based
   optical imaging and different fMRI contrasts, such as blood oxygenation
   level-dependent, cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume fMRI. In
   this review, we describe empirical evidence primarily from our own
   studies on how well these fMRI signals are spatially specific to the
   neuronally active site and discuss insights into neurovascular coupling
   at the mesoscale. This article is part of the theme issue `Key
   relationships between non-invasive functional neuroimaging and the
   underlying neuronal activity'.},

Abstract = {Epilepsy is a brain syndrome caused by synchronous abnormal discharge of
   brain neurons. As an effective treatment for epilepsy, successful
   surgical resection requires accurate localization of epileptic foci to
   avoid iatrogenic disability. Previous studies have demonstrated the
   potential of restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI) technique to localize epileptic foci though clinical
   applications of rs-fMRI are still at an early stage of development. fMRI
   data analysis approaches seek pre-defined regressors modeling
   contributions to the voxel time series, including the BOLD response
   following neuronal activation. In present study, localization strategies
   of epileptic foci in rs-fMRI technology were classified and summarized.
   To begin with, data-driven approaches attempting to determine the
   intrinsic structure of the data were discussed in detail. Then, as novel
   fMRI data analysis methods, deconvolution algorithms such as total
   activation (TA) and blind deconvolution were discussed, which were
   applied to explore the underlying activity-inducing signal of the BOLD
   signal. Lastly, effective connectivity approaches such as
   autocorrelation function method and Pearson correlation coefficient have
   also been proposed to identify the brain regions driving the generation
   of seizures within the epileptic network. In the future, fMRI technology
   can be used as a supplement of intraoperative subdural electrode method
   or combined with traditional epileptic focus localization technologies,
   which is one of the most attractive aspect in clinic. It may also play
   an important role in providing diagnostic information for epilepsy
   patients.},

Abstract = {Recent developments of optogenetic tools and fluorescence-based calcium
   recording techniques enable the manipulation and monitoring of neural
   circuits on a cellular level. Non-invasive imaging of brain networks,
   however, requires the application of methods such as blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   which is commonly used for functional neuroimaging. While BOLD fMRI
   provides brain-wide non-invasive reading of the hemodynamic response, it
   is only an indirect measure of neural activity. Direct observation of
   neural responses requires electrophysiological or optical methods. The
   latter can be combined with optogenetic control of neuronal circuits and
   are MRI compatible. Yet, simultaneous optical recordings are still
   limited to fiber-optic-based approaches. Here, we review the integration
   of optical recordings and optogenetic manipulation into fMRI
   experiments. As a practical example, we describe how BOLD fMRI in a
   9.4-T small animal MR scanner can be combined with in vivo fiber-optic
   calcium recordings and optogenetic control in a multimodal setup. We
   present simultaneous BOLD fMRI and calcium recordings under optogenetic
   control in rat. We outline details about MR coil configuration, choice,
   and usage of opsins and chemically and genetically encoded calcium
   sensors, fiber implantation, appropriate light power for stimulation,
   and calcium signal detection, to provide a glimpse into challenges and
   opportunities of this multimodal molecular neuroimaging approach.},

Abstract = {Abnormal brain development manifests itself at different spatial scales.
   However, whether abnormalities at the cellular level can be diagnosed
   from network activity measured with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) is largely unknown, yet of high clinical relevance. Here
   a putative mechanism reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, that is,
   excitation-to-inhibition ratio (E:I), was chemogenetically increased
   within cortical microcircuits of the mouse brain and measured via fMRI.
   Increased E:I caused a significant ``reduction{''} of long-range
   connectivity, irrespective of whether excitatory neurons were
   facilitated or inhibitory Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were suppressed.
   Training a classifier on fMRI signals, we were able to accurately
   classify cortical areas exhibiting increased E:I. This classifier was
   validated in an independent cohort of Fmr1 (y/-) knockout mice, a model
   for autism with well-documented loss of parvalbumin neurons and chronic
   alterations of E:I. Our findings demonstrate a promising novel approach
   towards inferring microcircuit abnormalities from macroscopic fMRI
   measurements.},

Abstract = {A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment produces
   complex-valued images consisting of pairwise magnitude and phase images.
   As different perspective on the same magnetic source, fMRI magnitude and
   phase data are complementary for brain function analysis. We collected
   600-subject fMRI data during rest, decomposed via group-level
   independent component analysis (ICA) (mICA and pICA for magnitude and
   phase respectively), and calculated brain functional network
   connectivity matrices (mFC and pFC). The pFC matrix shows a fewer of
   significant connections balancedacross positive and negative
   relationships. In comparison, the mFC matrix contains a
   positively-biased pattern with more significant connections. Our
   experiment data analyses also show that human brain maintains a
   whole-brain connection balance in resting state across an age span from
   10 to 76years, however, phase and magnitude data analyses reveal
   different connection-specific age effects on significant positive and
   negative subnetwork couplings.},

Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},

Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Ultra-high field 7-Tesla (7 T) MRI has the potential to advance our
   understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive
   disorder (MDD). To date, few studies have quantified the advantage of
   resting state functional MRI (fMRI) at 7 T compared to 3-Tesla (3 T). We
   conducted a series of experiments that demonstrate the improvement in
   temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of a multi-echo multi-band fMRI
   protocol with ultra-high field 7 T MRI, compared to a similar protocol
   using 3 T MRI in healthy controls (HC). We also directly tested the
   enhancement in ultra-high field 7 T fMRI signal power by examining the
   ventral tegmental area (VTA), a small midbrain structure that is
   critical to the expected neuropathology of MDD but difficult to discern
   with standard 3 T MRI. We demonstrate up to 300\% improvement in TSNR
   and resting state functional connectivity coefficients provided by
   ultra-high field 7 T fMRI compared to 3 T, indicating enhanced power for
   detection of functional neural architecture. A multi-echo based
   acquisition protocol and signal denoising pipeline afforded greater gain
   in signal power compared to classic acquisition and denoising pipelines.
   Furthermore, ultra-high field fMRI revealed mood-related neurocircuit
   disturbances in patients with MDD compared to HC, which were not
   detectable with 3 T fMRI. Ultra-high field 7 T fMRI may provide an
   effective tool for studying functional neural architecture relevant to
   MDD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

   all studies provide equivalent pieces of information. However, in
   task-based fMRI studies we see a large variety in reporting styles.
   Several specific meta-analysis methods have been developed to deal with
   the reporting practices occurring in task-based fMRI studies, therefore
   each requiring a specific type of input. In this manuscript we provide
   an overview of the meta-analysis methods and the specific input they
   require. Subsequently we discuss how decisions made during the study
   influence the eligibility of a study for a meta-analysis and finally we
   formulate some recommendations about how to report an fMRI study so that
   it complies with as many meta-analysis methods as possible.},

Abstract = {There have been successful applications of deep learning to functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where fMRI data were mostly
   considered to be structured grids, and spatial features from Euclidean
   neighbors were usually extracted by the convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) in the computer vision field. Recently, CNN has been extended to
   graph data and demonstrated superior performance. Here, we define graphs
   based on functional connectivity and present a connectivity-based graph
   convolutional network (cGCN) architecture for fMRI analysis. Such an
   approach allows us to extract spatial features from connectomic
   neighborhoods rather than from Euclidean ones, consistent with the
   functional organization of the brain. To evaluate the performance of
   cGCN, we applied it to two scenarios with resting-state fMRI data. One
   is individual identification of healthy participants and the other is
   classification of autistic patients from normal controls. Our results
   indicate that cGCN can effectively capture functional connectivity
   features in fMRI analysis for relevant applications.},

Volume = {2020},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In the research work of the brain-computer interface and the function of
   human brain work, the state classification of multitask state fMRI data
   is a problem. The fMRI signal of the human brain is a nonstationary
   signal with many noise effects and interference. Based on the commonly
   used nonstationary signal analysis method, Hilbert-Huang transform
   (HHT), we propose an improved circle-EMD algorithm to suppress the end
   effect. The algorithm can extract different intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs), decompose the fMRI data to filter out low frequency and other
   redundant noise signals, and more accurately reflect the true
   characteristics of the original signal. For the filtered fMRI signal, we
   use three existing different machine learning methods: logistic
   regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network
   (DNN) to achieve effective classification of different task states. The
   experiment compares the results of these machine learning methods and
   confirms that the deep neural network has the highest accuracy for
   task-state fMRI data classification and the effectiveness of the
   improved circle-EMD algorithm.},

Title = {Quiet and Distortion-Free, Whole Brain BOLD fMRI Using
   T<sub>2</sub>-Prepared RUFIS},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE},

Volume = {75},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate a novel MR method that addresses some
   of the most eminent technical challenges of current BOLD-based fMRI in
   terms of 1) acoustic noise and 2) geometric distortions and signal
   dropouts.
   Methods: A BOLD-sensitive fMRI pulse sequence was designed that first
   generates T-2-weighted magnetization (using a T-2 preparation module)
   and subsequently undergoes three-dimensional (3D) radial encoding using
   a rotating ultrafast imaging sequence (RUFIS). The method was tested on
   healthy volunteers at 3T with motor, visual, and auditory tasks, and
   compared relative to standard gradient and spin echo planar imaging
   (EPI) methods.
   Results: In combination with parallel imaging the method achieves
   efficient and robust 3D whole brain coverage (3 mm isotropic resolution
   in 2.65 s scan time). Compared with standard EPI-based fMRI, the method
   demonstrated 1) T-2-weighted imaging clean of geometrical distortions
   and signal dropout, 2) an acoustic noise reduction of similar to 40
   dB(A), and 3) a consistent BOLD response that is less sensitive (similar
   to 1.3\% BOLD change) but spatially more specific.
   Conclusion: T-2-prepared RUFIS provides quiet and distortion-free whole
   brain BOLD fMRI with minimal demands on the gradient performance. In
   particular, auditory fMRI and/or studies involving brain regions near
   air-tissue interfaces are expected to greatly benefit from the proposed
   method, especially if performed at ultrahigh field strengths. (C) 2015

Title = {Deep attentive spatio-temporal feature learning for automatic
   resting-state fMRI denoising},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {254},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a
   non-invasive functional neuroimaging modality that has been widely used
   to investigate functional connectomes in the brain. Since noise and
   artifacts generated by non-neuronal physiological activities are
   predominant in raw rs-fMRI data, effective noise removal is one of the
   most important preprocessing steps prior to any subsequent analysis. For
   rs-fMRI denoising, a common trend is to decompose rs-fMRI data into
   multiple components and then regress out noise-related components.
   Therefore, various machine learning techniques have been used in such
   analyses with predefined procedures and manually engineered features.
   However, the lack of a universal definition of a noise-related source or
   artifact complicates manual feature engineering. Manual feature
   selection can result in the failure to capture unknown types of noise.
   Furthermore, the possibility that the hand-crafted features will only
   work for the broader population (e.g., healthy adults) but not for
   ``outliers{''}(e.g., infants or subjects that belong to a disease
   cohort) is quite high. In practice, we have limited knowledge of which
   features should be extracted; thus, multi-classifier assembly must be
   implemented to improve performance, although this process is quite
   time-consuming. However, in real rs-fMRI applications, fast and accurate
   automatic identification of noise-related components on different
   datasets is critical. To solve this problem, we propose a novel,
   automatic, and end-to-end deep learning framework dedicated to
   noise-related component identification via a faster and more effective
   multi-layer feature extraction strategy that learns deeply embedded
   spatio-temporal features of the components. In this study, we achieved
   remarkable performance on various rs-fMRI datasets, including multiple
   adult rs-fMRI datasets from different rs-fMRI studies and an infant
   rs-fMRI dataset, which is quite heterogeneous and differs from that of
   adults. Our proposed framework also dramatically increases the noise
   detection speed owing to its inherent ability for deep learning ( < 1s
   for single-component classification). It can be easily integrated into
   any preprocessing pipeline, even those that do not use standard
   procedures but depend on alternative toolboxes.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {IntroductionElectroencephalographic (EEG) data quality is severely
   compromised when recorded inside the magnetic resonance (MR)
   environment. Here we characterized the impact of the
   ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact on resting-state EEG spectral
   properties and compared the effectiveness of seven common BCG correction
   methods to preserve EEG spectral features. We also assessed if these
   methods retained posterior alpha power reactivity to an eyes
   closure-opening (EC-EO) task and compared the results from EEG-informed
   fMRI analysis using different BCG correction approaches.
   MethodElectroencephalographic data from 20 healthy young adults were
   recorded outside the MR environment and during simultaneous fMRI
   acquisition. The gradient artifact was effectively removed from EEG-fMRI
   acquisitions using Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS). The BCG artifact
   was corrected with seven methods: AAS, Optimal Basis Set (OBS),
   Independent Component Analysis (ICA), OBS followed by ICA, AAS followed
   by ICA, PROJIC-AAS and PROJIC-OBS. EEG signal preservation was assessed
   by comparing the spectral power of traditional frequency bands from the
   corrected rs-EEG-fMRI data with the data recorded outside the scanner.
   We then assessed the preservation of posterior alpha functional
   reactivity by computing the ratio between the EC and EO conditions
   during the EC-EO task. EEG-informed fMRI analysis of the EC-EO task was
   performed using alpha power-derived BOLD signal predictors obtained from
   the EEG signals corrected with different methods. ResultsThe BCG
   artifact caused significant distortions (increased absolute power,
   altered relative power) across all frequency bands. Artifact
   residuals/signal losses were present after applying all correction
   methods. The EEG reactivity to the EC-EO task was better preserved with
   ICA-based correction approaches, particularly when using ICA feature
   extraction to isolate alpha power fluctuations, which allowed to
   accurately predict hemodynamic signal fluctuations during the
   EEG-informed fMRI analysis. DiscussionCurrent software solutions for the
   BCG artifact problem offer limited efficiency to preserve the EEG
   spectral power properties using this particular EEG setup. The
   state-of-the-art approaches tested here can be further refined and
   should be combined with hardware implementations to better preserve EEG
   signal properties during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Existing and novel BCG
   artifact correction methods should be validated by evaluating signal
   preservation of both ERPs and spontaneous EEG spectral power.},

   to the lack of high -quality data and labels, deep learning models tend
   to suffer from overfitting in the training process. Methods: In this
   work, we applied a recurrent Wasserstein generative adversarial net
   (RWGAN) to learn brain representation from volumetric fMRI data.
   Generative adversarial net (GAN) is widely used in nat-ural image
   generation and is able to capture the distribution of the input data,
   which enables the ex-traction of generalized features from fMRI and thus
   relieves the overfitting issue. The recurrent layers in RWGAN are
   designed to better model the local temporal features of the fMRI time
   series. The dis-criminator of RWGAN works as a deep feature extractor.
   With LASSO regression, the RWGAN model can decompose the fMRI data into
   temporal features and spatial features (FBNs). Furthermore, the
   generator of RWGAN can generate high-quality new data for fMRI
   augmentation. Results: The experimental results on seven tasks from the
   HCP dataset showed that the RWGAN can learn meaningful and interpretable
   temporal features and FBNs, compared to HCP task designs and general
   linear model (GLM) derived networks. Besides, the results on different
   training datasets showed that the RWGAN performed better on small
   datasets than other deep learning models. Moreover, we used the
   generator of RWGAN to yield fake subjects. The result showed that the
   fake data can also be used to learn meaningful representation compared
   to those learned from real data. Conclusions: To our best knowledge,
   this work is among the earliest attempts of applying generative deep
   learning for modeling fMRI data. The proposed RWGAN offers a novel
   methodology for learning brain representation from fMRI, and it can
   generate high-quality fake data for the potential use of fMRI data
   augmentation. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Skull stripping is an initial and critical step in the pipeline of mouse
   fMRI analysis. Manual labeling of the brain usually suffers from intra-
   and inter-rater variability and is highly time-consuming. Hence, an
   automatic and efficient skull-stripping method is in high demand for
   mouse fMRI studies. In this study, we investigated a 3D U-Net based
   method for automatic brain extraction in mouse fMRI studies. Two U-Net
   models were separately trained on T2-weighted anatomical images and
   T2{*}-weighted functional images. The trained models were tested on both
   interior and exterior datasets. The 3D U-Net models yielded a higher
   accuracy in brain extraction from both T2-weighted images (Dice > 0.984,
   Jaccard index > 0.968 and Hausdorff distance < 7.7) and T2{*}-weighted
   images (Dice > 0.964, Jaccard index > 0.931 and Hausdorff distance <
   3.3), compared with the two widely used mouse skull-stripping methods
   (RATS and SHERM). The resting-state fMRI results using automatic
   segmentation with the 3D U-Net models are highly consistent with those
   obtained by manual segmentation for both the seed-based and group
   independent component analysis. These results demonstrate that the 3D
   U-Net based method can replace manual brain extraction in mouse fMRI
   analysis.},

Title = {A Functional MRI Paradigm Suitable for Language and Memory Mapping in
   Pediatric Temporal Lobe Epilepsy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a technique frequently
   used to determine the territories of eloquent tissue that serve critical
   functions, such as language. This can be particularly useful as part of
   the pre-surgical assessment for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in order to
   predict cognitive outcome and guide surgical decision-making. Whereas
   language fMRI is widely used, memory fMRI is less frequently employed in
   adult TLE, and lacking in childhood TLE. We have developed a combined
   language/memory fMRI paradigm that is suitable for children, to provide
   clinically useful information for surgical planning in pediatric TLE. We
   evaluated this paradigm in 28 healthy children, aged 8 to 18 years. The
   advantages of this paradigm are: (a) it examines the functional mapping
   of language and memory networks within one scanning session, (b)
   provides assessment of both memory encoding- and retrieval-related
   neural networks, (c) examines recall-based retrieval to engage
   hippocampal involvement compared to recognition-based retrieval, and (d)
   provides overt verbal responses to monitor in-scanner memory
   performance. This novel fMRI paradigm was designed for language and
   memory mapping in pediatric TLE and could provide clinically useful
   information for surgical planning. Finally, parallel versions of the
   paradigm allow the comparison of brain activations pre- and
   post-surgical intervention.},

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanners are unavoidably
   loud and uncomfortable experimental tools that are necessary for
   schizophrenia (SZ) neuroscience research. The validity of fMRI paradigms
   might be undermined by well-known sensory processing abnormalities in SZ
   that could exert distinct effects on neural activity in the presence of
   scanner background sound. Given the ubiquity of resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) paradigms in SZ research, elucidating the relationship between
   neural, hemodynamic, and sensory processing deficits during scanning is
   necessary to refine the construct validity of the MR neuroimaging
   environment. We recorded simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI
   at rest in people with SZ (n = 57) and healthy control participants
   without a psychiatric diagnosis (n = 46) and identified gamma EEG
   activity in the same frequency range as the background sounds emitted
   from our scanner during a resting-state sequence. In participants with
   SZ, gamma coupling to the hemodynamic signal was reduced in bilateral
   auditory regions of the superior temporal gyri. Impaired
   gamma-hemodynamic coupling was associated with sensory gating deficits
   and worse symptom severity. Fundamental sensory-neural processing
   deficits in SZ are present at rest when considering scanner background
   sound as a ``stimulus.{''} This finding may impact the interpretation of
   rs-fMRI activity in studies of people with SZ. Future neuroimaging
   research in SZ might consider background sound as a confounding
   variable, potentially related to fluctuations in neural excitability and
   arousal.},

Abstract = {The brain exhibits highly organized patterns of spontaneous activity as
   measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   fluctuations that are being widely used to assess the brain's functional
   connectivity. Some evidence suggests that spatiotemporally coherent
   waves are a core feature of spontaneous activity that shapes functional
   connectivity, although this has been difficult to establish using fMRI
   given the temporal constraints of the hemodynamic signal. Here, we
   investigated the structure of spontaneous waves in human fMRI and monkey
   electrocorticography. In both species, we found clear, repeatable, and
   directionally constrained activity waves coursed along a spatial axis
   approximately representing cortical hierarchical organization. These
   cortical propagations were closely associated with activity changes in
   distinct subcortical structures, particularly those related to arousal
   regulation, and modulated across different states of vigilance. The
   findings demonstrate a neural origin of spatiotemporal fMRI wave
   propagation at rest and link it to the principal gradient of
   resting-state fMRI connectivity.},

Title = {Lowering the thermal noise barrier in functional brain mapping with
   magnetic resonance imaging},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an indispensable
   tool for investigating the human brain. However, the inherently poor
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the fMRI measurement represents a major
   barrier to expanding its spatiotemporal scale as well as its utility and
   ultimate impact. Here we introduce a denoising technique that
   selectively suppresses the thermal noise contribution to the fMRI
   experiment. Using 7-Tesla, high-resolution human brain data, we
   demonstrate improvements in key metrics of functional mapping
   (temporal-SNR, the detection and reproducibility of stimulus-induced
   signal changes, and accuracy of functional maps) while leaving the
   amplitude of the stimulus-induced signal changes, spatial precision, and
   functional point-spread-function unaltered. We demonstrate that the
   method enables the acquisition of ultrahigh resolution (0.5mm isotropic)
   functional maps but is also equally beneficial for a large variety of
   fMRI applications, including supra-millimeter resolution 3- and 7-Tesla
   data obtained over different cortical regions with different
   stimulation/task paradigms and acquisition strategies.},

Title = {Estimates of locus coeruleus function with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging are influenced by localization approaches and the use of
   multi-echo data},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {236},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The locus coeruleus (LC) plays a central role in regulating human
   cognition, arousal, and autonomic states. Efforts to characterize the
   LC's function in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging have
   been hampered by its small size and location near a large source of
   noise, the fourth ventricle. We tested whether the ability to
   characterize LC function is improved by employing neuromelanin-T1
   weighted images (nmT1) for LC localization and multi-echo functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (ME-fMRI) for estimating intrinsic functional
   connectivity (iFC). Analyses indicated that, relative to a probabilistic
   atlas, utilizing nmT1 images to individually localize the LC increases
   the specificity of seed time series and clusters in the iFC maps. When
   combined with independent components analysis (ME-ICA), ME-fMRI data
   provided significant improvements in the temporal signal to noise ratio
   and DVARS relative to denoised single echo data (1E-fMRI). The effects
   of acquiring nmT1 images and ME-fMRI data did not appear to only reflect
   increases in power: iFC maps for each approach overlapped only
   moderately. This is consistent with findings that ME-fMRI offers
   substantial advantages over 1E-fMRI acquisition and denoising. It also
   suggests that individually identifying LC with nmT1 scans is likely to
   reduce the influence of other nearby brainstem regions on estimates of
   LC function.},

Title = {Let's Not Waste Time: Using Temporal Information in Clustered Activity
   Estimation with Spatial Adjacency Restrictions (CAESAR) for Parcellating
   FMRI Data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {We have proposed a Bayesian approach for functional parcellation of
   whole-brain FMRI measurements which we call Clustered Activity
   Estimation with Spatial Adjacency Restrictions (CAESAR). We use
   distance-dependent Chinese restaurant processes (dd-CRPs) to define a
   flexible prior which partitions the voxel measurements into clusters
   whose number and shapes are unknown a priori. With dd-CRPs we can
   conveniently implement spatial constraints to ensure that our
   parcellations remain spatially contiguous and thereby physiologically
   meaningful. In the present work, we extend CAESAR by using Gaussian
   process (GP) priors to model the temporally smooth haemodynamic signals
   that give rise to the measured FMRI data. A challenge for GP inference
   in our setting is the cubic scaling with respect to the number of time
   points, which can become computationally prohibitive with FMRI
   measurements, potentially consisting of long time series. As a solution
   we describe an efficient implementation that is practically as fast as
   the corresponding time-independent non-GP model with typically-sized
   FMRI data sets. We also employ a population Monte-Carlo algorithm that
   can significantly speed up convergence compared to traditional
   single-chain methods. First we illustrate the benefits of CAESAR and the
   GP priors with simulated experiments. Next, we demonstrate our approach
   by parcellating resting state FMRI data measured from twenty
   participants as taken from the Human Connectome Project data repository.
   Results show that CAESAR affords highly robust and scalable whole-brain
   clustering of FMRI timecourses.},

Title = {Semantic fMRI neurofeedback: a multi-subject study at 3 tesla},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Objective. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback
   (rt-fMRI-NF) is a non-invasive procedure allowing the self-regulation of
   brain functions via enhanced self-control of fMRI based neural
   activation. In semantic rt-fMRI-NF, an estimated relation between
   multivariate fMRI activation patterns and abstract mental states is
   exploited for a multi-dimensional feedback stimulus via real-time
   representational similarity analysis (rt-RSA). Here, we assessed the
   performances of this framework in a multi-subject multi-session study on
   a 3 T MRI clinical scanner. Approach. Eighteen healthy volunteers
   underwent two semantic rt-fMRI-NF sessions on two different days. In
   each session, participants were first requested to engage in specific
   mental states while local fMRI patterns of brain activity were recorded
   during stimulated mental imagery of concrete objects (pattern
   generation). The obtained neural representations were to be replicated
   and modulated by the participants in subsequent runs of the same session
   under the guidance of a rt-RSA generated visual feedback (pattern
   modulation). Performance indicators were derived from the rt-RSA output
   to assess individual abilities in replicating (and maintaining over
   time) a target pattern. Simulations were carried out to assess the
   impact of the geometric distortions implied by the low-dimensional
   representation of patterns' dissimilarities in the visual feedback. Main
   results. Sixteen subjects successfully completed both semantic
   rt-fMRI-NF sessions. Considering some performance indicators, a
   significant improvement between the first and the second runs, and
   within run increasing modulation performances were observed, whereas no
   improvements were found between sessions. Simulations confirmed that in
   a small percentage of cases visual feedback could be affected by metric
   distortions due to dimensionality reduction implicit to the rt-RSA
   approach. Significance. Our results proved the feasibility of the
   semantic rt-fMRI-NF at 3 T, showing that subjects can successfully
   modulate and maintain a target mental state when guided by rt-RSA
   derived feedback. Further development is needed to encourage future
   clinical applications.},

Title = {Unexpected global impact of VTA dopamine neuron activation as measured

Journal = {MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are strongly
   implicated in cognitive and affective processing as well as in
   psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression,
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse disorders.
   In human studies, dopamine-related functions are routinely assessed
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of blood
   oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during the performance of
   dopamine-dependent tasks. There is, however, a critical void in our
   knowledge about whether and how activation of VTA dopamine neurons
   specifically influences regional or global fMRI signals. Here, we used
   optogenetics in Th:: Cre rats to selectively stimulate VTA dopamine
   neurons while simultaneously measuring global hemodynamic changes using
   BOLD and cerebral blood volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI. Phasic activation
   of VTA dopamine neurons increased BOLD and CBVw fMRI signals in
   VTA-innervated limbic regions, including the ventral striatum (nucleus
   accumbens). Surprisingly, basal ganglia regions that receive sparse or
   no VTA dopaminergic innervation, including the dorsal striatum and the
   globus pallidus, were also activated. In fact, the most prominent fMRI
   signal increase in the forebrain was observed in the dorsal striatum
   that is not traditionally associated with VTA dopamine
   neurotransmission. These data establish causation between phasic
   activation of VTA dopamine neurons and global fMRI signals. They further
   suggest that mesolimbic and non-limbic basal ganglia dopamine circuits
   are functionally connected and thus provide a potential novel framework
   for understanding dopamine-dependent functions and interpreting data
   obtained from human fMRI studies.},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This work reviews recent advances in technologies for functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain and highlights the
   push for higher functional specificity based on increased spatial
   resolution and specific MR contrasts to reveal previously undetectable
   functional properties of small-scale cortical structures. We discuss how
   the combination of MR hardware, advanced acquisition techniques and
   various MR contrast mechanisms have enabled recent progress in
   functional neuroimaging. However, these advanced fMRI practices have
   only been applied to a handful of neuroscience questions to date, with
   the majority of the neuroscience community still using conventional
   imaging techniques. We thus discuss upcoming challenges and

Title = {Hemodynamic Scaling of Task-Induced Signal Changes in Tumor Subjects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Background:FMRI signal amplitude can change during stimulus presentation
   due to underlying neural function and hemodynamic responses limiting the
   accuracy of fMRI in pre-surgical planning. To account for these changes
   in fMRI activation signal, we used breath-hold tasks to mimic
   hemodynamic changes in brain tumor subjects and scaled the activation
   response. Methods:Motor and/or language fMRI was performed in 21
   subjects with brain tumor. A breath-hold task was also performed in
   these subjects to obtain the hemodynamic response changes independent of
   neural changes. The task activation signals were calibrated on a voxel
   wise basis for all the subjects. Direct cortical stimulation was used to
   verify the scaled results of task-based fMRI. Results:After scaling for
   the hemodynamic response function (HRF) on a voxel wise basis, the
   spatial extent of the scaled activation was more clustered together and
   appeared to minimize false positives. Similarly, accounting for the
   underlying canonical HRF, the percentage increase of active voxels after
   scaling had lower standard non-deviation suggesting that the activation
   response across voxels were more similar. Conclusion:Although
   preliminary in nature, this study suggests that the variation in
   hemodynamic changes can be calibrated using breath-hold in brain tumor
   subjects and can also be used for other clinical cases where the
   underlying HRF has been altered.},

Title = {No evidence from a negative mood induction fMRI task for frontal
   functional asymmetry as a suitable neurofeedback target},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {Frontal functional asymmetry (FA) has been proposed as a potential
   target for neurofeedback (NFB) training for mental disorders but most FA
   NFB studies used electroencephalography while the investigations of FA
   NFB in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are rather limited.
   In this study, we aimed at identifying functional asymmetry effects in
   fMRI and exploring its potential as a target for fMRI NFB studies by
   re-analyzing an existing data set containing a resting state measurement
   and a sad mood induction task of n = 30 participants with remitted major
   depressive disorder and n = 30 matched healthy controls. We applied
   low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF, and regional
   homogeneity and estimated functional asymmetry in both a voxel-wise and
   regional manner. We assessed functional asymmetry during rest and
   negative mood induction as well as functional asymmetry changes between
   the phases, and associated the induced mood change with the change in
   functional asymmetry. Analyses were conducted within as well as between
   groups. Despite extensive analyses, we identified only very limited
   effects. While some tests showed nominal significance, our results did
   not contain any clear identifiable patterns of effects that would be
   expected if a true underlying effect would be present. In conclusion, we
   do not find evidence for FA effects related to negative mood in fMRI,
   which questions the usefulness of FA measures for real-time fMRI
   neurofeedback as a treatment approach for affective disorders.},

Abstract = {Disability and effectiveness of physical therapy are highly variable
   following ischemic stroke due to different brain regions being affected.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of patients in the
   months and years following stroke have given some insight into how the
   brain recovers lost functions. Initially, new pathways are recruited to
   compensate for the lost region, showing as a brighter blood
   oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal over a larger area during a task
   than in healthy controls. Subsequently, activity is reduced to baseline
   levels as pathways become more efficient, mimicking the process of
   learning typically seen during development. Preclinical models of
   ischemic stroke aim to enhance understanding of the biology underlying
   recovery following stroke. However, the pattern of recruitment and
   focusing seen in humans has not been observed in preclinical fMRI
   studies that are highly variable methodologically. Resting-state fMRI
   studies show more consistency; however, there are still confounding
   factors to address. Anesthesia and method of stroke induction are the
   two main sources of variability in preclinical studies; improvements
   here can reduce variability and increase the intensity and
   reproducibility of the BOLD response detected by fMRI. Differences in
   task or stimulus and differences in analysis method also present a
   source of variability. This review compares clinical and preclinical
   fMRI studies of recovery following stroke and focuses on how refinement
   of preclinical models and MRI methods may obtain more representative
   fMRI data in relation to human studies.},

Abstract = {The mirror neuron system (MNS) is a brain network that has been
   associated with the understanding of the actions performed by others.
   The main areas of the brain that are considered as belonging to the MNS
   are the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and the
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Many studies have tried to focus on the
   relationship between the regions belonging to the MNS, but a little
   consideration has been given to the study of the MNS in resting
   conditions. In the present experiment, the MNS has been studied by two
   fMRI modalities (task-based fMRI and resting-fMRI) and three analytical
   procedures {[}task-block comparison, functional connectivity (FC), and
   independent component analysis (ICA)]. The task-fMRI with block design
   showed a mirror activity located in the rostral IPL. The coordinates of
   this local maximum voxel were defined as a region of interest (ROI) for
   an FC analysis of the resting-fMRI. This analysis revealed the existence
   of a functional connectivity within regions forming the core of MNS
   network and also with other regions with mirror properties. Finally,
   resting-state fMRI ICA showed the same functional network, although it
   was more restricted to the core MNS regions. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first study that approaches the MNS using the
   resting-state fMRI analysis using independent component analysis and
   functional connectivity at the same time.},

Title = {Improving the Test-Retest Reliability of Resting State fMRI by Removing
   the Impact of Sleep},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a
   powerful tool to examine large-scale neural networks in the human brain
   and their disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders. Thanks to its low
   demand and high tolerance, resting state paradigms can be easily
   acquired from clinical population. However, due to the unconstrained
   nature, resting state paradigm is associated with excessive head
   movement and proneness to sleep. Consequently, the test-retest
   reliability of rs-fMRI measures is moderate at best, falling short of
   widespread use in the clinic. Here, we characterized the effect of sleep
   on the test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI. Using measures of heart rate
   variability (HRV) derived from simultaneous electrocardiogram(ECG)
   recording, we identified portions of fMRI data when subjects were more
   alert or sleepy, and examined their effects on the test-retest
   reliability of functional connectivity measures. When volumes of sleep
   were excluded, the reliability of rs-fMRI is significantly improved, and
   the improvement appears to be general across brain networks. The amount
   of improvement is robust with the removal of as much as 60\% volumes of

Title = {Toward Precise Localization of Abnormal Brain Activity: 1D CNN on Single
   Voxel fMRI Time-Series},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the best
   techniques for precise localization of abnormal brain activity
   non-invasively. Machine-learning approaches have been widely used in
   neuroimaging studies; however, few studies have investigated the
   single-voxel modeling of fMRI data under cognitive tasks. We proposed a
   hybrid one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) based
   on the temporal dynamics of single-voxel fMRI time-series and
   successfully differentiated two continuous task states, namely,
   self-initiated (SI) and visually guided (VG) motor tasks. First, 25
   activation peaks were identified from the contrast maps of SI and VG
   tasks in a blocked design. Then, the fMRI time-series of each peak voxel
   was transformed into a temporal-frequency domain by using continuous
   wavelet transform across a broader frequency range (0.003-0.313 Hz, with
   a step of 0.01 Hz). The transformed time-series was inputted into a
   1D-CNN model for the binary classification of SI and VG continuous
   tasks. Compared with the univariate analysis, e.g., amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) at each frequency band, including,
   wavelet-ALFF, the 1D-CNN model highly outperformed wavelet-ALFF, with
   more efficient decoding models {[}46\% of 800 models showing area under
   the curve (AUC) > 0.61] and higher decoding accuracies (94\% of the
   efficient models), especially on the high-frequency bands (>0.1 Hz).
   Moreover, our results also demonstrated the advantages of wavelet
   decompositions over the original fMRI series by showing higher decoding
   performance on all peak voxels. Overall, this study suggests a great
   potential of single-voxel analysis using 1D-CNN and wavelet
   transformation of fMRI series with continuous, naturalistic,
   steady-state task design or resting-state design. It opens new avenues
   to precise localization of abnormal brain activity and fMRI-guided
   precision brain stimulation therapy.},

Title = {The dynamic programming high-order Dynamic Bayesian Networks learning
   for identifying effective connectivity in human brain from fMRI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {285},
Pages = {33-44},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Determination of effective connectivity (EC) among brain
   regions using fMRI is helpful in understanding the underlying neural
   mechanisms. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are an appropriate class of
   probabilistic graphical temporal-models that have been used in past to
   model EC from fMRI, specifically order-one.
   New-method: High-order DBNs (HO-DBNs) have still not been explored for
   fMRI data. A fundamental problem faced in the structure-learning of
   HO-DBN is high computational-burden and low accuracy by the existing
   heuristic search techniques used for EC detection from fMRI. In this
   paper, we propose using dynamic programming (DP) principle along with
   integration of properties of scoring-function in a way to reduce search
   space for structure-learning of HO-DBNs and finally, for identifying EC
   from fMRI which has not been done yet to the best of our knowledge. The
   proposed exact search-\&-score learning approach HO-DBN-DP is an
   extension of the technique which was originally devised for learning a
   BN's structure from static data (Singh and Moore, 2005).
   Results: The effectiveness in structure-learning is shown on synthetic
   fMRI dataset. The algorithm reaches globally-optimal solution in
   appreciably reduced time-complexity than the static counterpart due to
   integration of properties. The proof of optimality is provided.
   Comparison: The results demonstrate that HO-DBN-DP is comparably more
   accurate and faster than currently used structure-learning algorithms
   used for identifying EC from fMRI. The real data EC from HO-DBN-DP shows
   consistency with previous literature than the classical Granger
   Causality method.
   Conclusion: Hence, the DP algorithm can be employed for reliable EC
   estimates from experimental fMRI data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The behaviors that define autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been
   hypothesized to result from disordered communication within brain
   networks. Several groups have investigated this question using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). However,
   the published findings to date have been inconsistent across
   laboratories. Prior RS-fMRI studies of ASD have employed conventional
   analysis techniques based on the assumption that intrinsic brain
   activity is exactly synchronous over widely separated parts of the
   brain. By relaxing the assumption of synchronicity and focusing,
   instead, on lags between time series, we have recently demonstrated
   highly reproducible patterns of temporally lagged activity in normal
   human adults. We refer to this analysis technique as resting-state lag
   analysis (RS-LA). Here, we report RS-LA as well as conventional analyses
   of RS-fMRI in adults with ASD and demographically matched controls.
   RS-LA analyses demonstrated significant group differences in rs-fMRI lag
   structure in frontopolar cortex, occipital cortex, and putamen.
   Moreover, the degree of abnormality in individuals was highly correlated
   with behavioral measures relevant to the diagnosis of ASD. In this
   sample, no significant group differences were observed using
   conventional RS-fMRI analysis techniques. Our results suggest that
   altered propagation of intrinsic activity may contribute to abnormal
   brain function in ASD.},

Title = {Multimodal fusion of multiple rest fMRI networks and MRI gray matter via
   parallel multilink joint ICA reveals highly significant

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on estimating the joint relationship between
   structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) gray matter (GM), and
   multiple functional MRI (fMRI) intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs).
   To achieve this, we propose a multilink joint independent component
   analysis (ml-jICA) method using the same core algorithm as jICA. To
   relax the jICA assumption, we propose another extension called parallel
   multilink jICA (pml-jICA) that allows for a more balanced weight
   distribution over ml-jICA/jICA. We assume a shared mixing matrix for
   both the sMRI and fMRI modalities, while allowing for different mixing
   matrices linking the sMRI data to the different ICNs. We introduce the
   model and then apply this approach to study the differences in resting
   fMRI and sMRI data from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus
   controls. The results of the pml-jICA yield significant differences with
   large effect sizes that include regions in overlapping portions of
   default mode network, and also hippocampus and thalamus. Importantly, we
   identify two joint components with partially overlapping regions which
   show opposite effects for AD versus controls, but were able to be
   separated due to being linked to distinct functional and structural
   patterns. This highlights the unique strength of our approach and
   multimodal fusion approaches generally in revealing potentially
   biomarkers of brain disorders that would likely be missed by a unimodal
   approach. These results represent the first work linking multiple fMRI
   ICNs to GM components within a multimodal data fusion model and
   challenges the typical view that brain structure is more sensitive to AD
   than fMRI.},

Abstract = {Event related potentials (ERPs) provide precise temporal information
   about cognitive processing, but with poor spatial resolution, while
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reliably identifies brain
   areas involved, but with poor temporal resolution. Here we use fMRI to
   guide source localization of the ERPs at different times for studying
   the temporal dynamics of the neural system for recognizing familiar
   faces. fMRI activation areas were defined in a previous experiment
   applying the same paradigm used for ERPs. The Bayesian model averaging
   (BMA) method was used to estimate the generators of the ERPs to
   unfamiliar, visually familiar, and personally-familiar faces
   constraining the model by fMRI activation results. For this, higher
   prior probabilities in the solution space were assigned to the
   fMRI-defined regions, which included face-selective areas and other
   areas related to person knowledge retrieval. Source analysis was carried
   out in three-time windows: early (150-210ms), middle (300-380ms) and
   late (460-580ms). The early and middle responses were generated in
   fMRI-defined areas for all face categories, while these areas do not
   contribute to the late response. Different areas contributed to the
   generation of the early and middle ERPs elicited by unfamiliar faces:
   fusiform (Fus), inferior occipital, superior temporal sulcus and the
   posterior cingulate (PC) cortices. For familiar faces, the contributing
   areas were Fus, PC and anterior temporal areas for visually familiar
   faces, with the addition of the medial orbitofrontal areas and other
   frontal structures for personally-significant faces. For both unfamiliar
   and familiar faces, more extended and reliable involvement of
   contributing areas were obtained for the middle compare with early time
   window. Our fMRI guide ERP source analysis suggested the recruitment of
   person-knowledge processing areas as early as 150-210ms after stimulus
   onset during recognition of personally-familiar faces. We concluded that
   fMRI-constrained BMA source analysis provide information regarding the
   temporal-dynamics in the neural system for cognitive processsing.},

Title = {Improving the sensitivity of spin-echo fMRI at 3T by highly accelerated
   acquisitions},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},

Abstract = {Purpose: Spin-echo (SE) functional MRI (fMRI) can be highly advantageous
   compared to gradient-echo (GE) fMRI with respect to magnetic
   field-inhomogeneity artifacts. However, at 3T, the majority of blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI experiments are performed using
   T{*}(2) -weighted GE sequences because of their superior sensitivity
   compared to SE-fMRI. The presented SE implementation of a highly
   accelerated GE pulse sequence therefore aims to improve the sensitivity
   of SE-fMRI while profiting from a reduction of susceptibility-induced
   signal dropout.
   Methods: Spin-echo MR encephalography (SE-MREG) is compared with the
   more conventionally used spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) and
   spin-echo simultaneous multislice (SE-SMS) at 3T in terms of capability
   to detect neuronal activations and resting-state functional
   connectivity. For activation analysis, healthy subjects underwent
   consecutive SE-MREG (pulse repetition time {[}TR] = 0.25 seconds),
   SE-SMS (TR = 1.3 seconds), and SE-EPI (TR = 4.4 seconds) scans in
   pseudorandomized order applied to a visual block design paradigm for
   generation of t-statistics maps. For the investigation of functional
   connectivity, additional resting-state data were acquired for 5 minutes
   and a seed-based correlation analysis using Stanford's FIND (Functional
   Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders) atlas was performed.
   Results: The increased sampling rate of SE-MREG relative to SE-SMS and
   SE-EPI improves the sensitivity to detect BOLD activation by 33\% and
   54\%, respectively, and increases the capability to extract
   resting-state networks. Compared with a brain region that is not
   affected by magnetic field inhomogeneities, SE-MREG shows 2.5 times
   higher relative signal strength than GE-MREG in mesial temporal
   structures.
   Conclusion: SE-MREG offers a viable possibility for whole-brain fMRI
   with consideration of brain regions that are affected by strong
   susceptibility-induced magnetic field gradients.},

Title = {Moderated<i> t-</i> tests for group-level fMRI analysis},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant criticism of functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with small sample sizes. The
   argument is that such studies have low statistical power, as well as
   reduced likelihood for statistically significant results to be true
   effects. The prevalence of these studies has led to a situation where a
   large number of published results are not replicable and likely false.
   Despite this growing body of evidence, small sample fMRI studies
   continue to be regularly performed; likely due to the high cost of
   scanning. In this report we investigate the use of a moderated
   t-statistic for performing group-level fMRI analysis to help alleviate
   problems related to small sample sizes. The proposed approach,
   implemented in the popular R-package LIMMA (linear models for microarray
   data), has found wide usage in the genomics literature for dealing with
   similar issues. Utilizing task-based fMRI data from the Human Connectome
   Project (HCP), we compare the performance of the moderated t-statistic
   with the standard t-statistic, as well as the pseudo t-statistic
   commonly used in non parametric fMRI analysis. We find that the
   moderated t-test significantly outperforms both alternative approaches
   for studies with sample sizes less than 40 subjects. Further, we find
   that the results were consistent both when using voxel-based and
   cluster-based thresholding. We also introduce an R-package, LIMMI
   (linear models for medical images), that provides a quick and convenient
   way to apply the method to fMRI data.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, many people worldwide suffer from brain disorders, and their
   health is in danger. So far, numerous methods have been proposed for the
   diagnosis of Schizophrenia (SZ) and attention deficit hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD), among which functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) modalities are known as a popular method among physicians. This
   paper presents an SZ and ADHD intelligent detection method of
   resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) modality using a new deep learning method.
   The University of California Los Angeles dataset, which contains the
   rs-fMRI modalities of SZ and ADHD patients, has been used for
   experiments. The FMRIB software library toolbox first performed
   preprocessing on rs-fMRI data. Then, a convolutional Autoencoder model
   with the proposed number of layers is used to extract features from
   rs-fMRI data. In the classification step, a new fuzzy method called
   interval type-2 fuzzy regression (IT2FR) is introduced and then
   optimized by genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and gray
   wolf optimization (GWO) techniques. Also, the results of IT2FR methods
   are compared with multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, support
   vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, and adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system methods. The experiment results show that
   the IT2FR method with the GWO optimization algorithm has achieved
   satisfactory results compared to other classifier methods. Finally, the
   proposed classification technique was able to provide 72.71\% accuracy.},

Abstract = {Real-time quality assessment (rtQA) of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal
   changes is critical for neuroimaging research and clinical applications.
   The losses of BOLD sensitivity because of different types of technical
   and physiological noise remain major sources of fMRI artifacts. Due to
   difficulty of subjective visual perception of image distortions during
   data acquisitions, a comprehensive automatic rtQA is needed. To
   facilitate rapid rtQA of fMRI data, we applied real-time and recursive
   quality assessment methods to whole-brain fMRI volumes, as well as
   time-series of target brain areas and resting-state networks. We
   estimated recursive temporal signal-to-noise ratio (rtSNR) and
   contrast-to-noise ratio (rtCNR), and real-time head motion parameters by
   a framewise rigid-body transformation (translations and rotations) using
   the conventional current to template volume registration. In addition,
   we derived real-time framewise (FD) and micro (MD) displacements based
   on head motion parameters and evaluated the temporal derivative of root
   mean squared variance over voxels (DVARS). For monitoring time-series of
   target regions and networks, we estimated the number of spikes and
   amount of filtered noise by means of a modified Kalman filter. Finally,
   we applied the incremental general linear modeling (GLM) to evaluate
   real-time contributions of nuisance regressors (linear trend and head
   motion). Proposed rtQA was demonstrated in real-time fMRI neurofeedback
   runs without and with excessive head motion and real-time simulations of
   neurofeedback and resting-state fMRI data. The rtQA was implemented as
   an extension of the open-source OpenNFT software written in Python,
   MATLAB and C++ for neurofeedback, task-based, and resting-state
   paradigms. We also developed a general Python library to unify real-time
   fMRI data processing and neurofeedback applications. Flexible estimation
   and visualization of rtQA facilitates efficient rtQA of fMRI data and
   helps the robustness of fMRI acquisitions by means of substantiating
   decisions about the necessity of the interruption and re-start of the
   experiment and increasing the confidence in neural estimates.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To validate a novel setup for concurrent TMS/fMRI in the human
   motor cortex based on a dedicated, ultra-thin, multichannel receive MR
   coil positioned between scalp and TMS system providing greatly enhanced
   sensitivity compared to the standard birdcage coil setting.
   Methods: A combined TMS/fMRI design was applied over the primary motor
   cortex based on 1 Hz stimulation with stimulation levels of 80\%, 90\%,
   100\%, and 110\% of the individual active motor threshold, respectively.
   Due to the use of a multichannel receive coil we were able to use
   multiband-accelerated (MB=2) EPI sequences for the acquisition of
   functional images. Data were analysed with SPM12 and BOLD-weighted
   signal intensity time courses were extracted in each subject from two
   local maxima (individual functional finger tapping localiser, fixed MM
   coordinate of the hand knob) next to the hand area of the primary motor
   cortex (M1) and from the global maximum.
   Results: We report excellent image quality without noticeable signal
   dropouts or image distortions. Parameter estimates in the three peak
   voxels showed monotonically ascending activation levels over increasing
   stimulation intensities. Across all subjects, mean BOLD signal changes
   for 80\%, 90\%, 100\%, 110\% of the individual active motor threshold
   were 0.43\%, 0.63\%, 1.01\%, 2.01\% next to the individual functional
   finger tapping maximum, 0.73\%, 0.91\%, 1.34\%, 2.21\% next to the
   MM-defined hand knob and 0.88\%, 1.09\%, 1.65\%, 2.77\% for the global
   maximum, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our results show that the new setup for concurrent TMS/fMRI
   experiments using a dedicated MR coil array allows for high-sensitivity
   fMRI particularly at the site of stimulation. Contrary to the standard
   birdcage approach, the results also demonstrate that the new coil can be
   successfully used for multibandaccelerated EPI acquisition. The gain in
   flexibility due to the new coil can be easily combined with
   neuronavigation within the MR scanner to allow for accurate targeting in
   TMS/fMRI experiments.},

Title = {Critical factors in achieving fine-scale functional MRI: Removing
   sources of inadvertent spatial smoothing},
Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},

Pages = {3311-3331},

Abstract = {Ultra-high Field (>= 7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (UHF-fMRI) provides opportunities to resolve fine-scale features of
   functional architecture such as cerebral cortical columns and layers, in
   vivo. While the nominal resolution of modern fMRI acquisitions may
   appear to be sufficient to resolve these features, several common data
   preprocessing steps can introduce unwanted spatial blurring, especially
   those that require interpolation of the data. These resolution losses
   can impede the detection of the fine-scale features of interest. To
   examine quantitatively and systematically the sources of spatial
   resolution losses occurring during preprocessing, we used synthetic fMRI
   data and real fMRI data from the human visual cortex-the spatially
   interdigitated human V2 ``thin{''} and ``thick{''} stripes. The pattern
   of these cortical columns lies along the cortical surface and thus can
   be best appreciated using surface-based fMRI analysis. We used this as a
   testbed for evaluating strategies that can reduce spatial blurring of
   fMRI data. Our results show that resolution losses can be mitigated at
   multiple points in preprocessing pathway. We show that unwanted blur is
   introduced at each step of volume transformation and surface projection,
   and can be ameliorated by replacing multi-step transformations with
   equivalent single-step transformations. Surprisingly, the simple
   approaches of volume upsampling and of cortical mesh refinement also
   helped to reduce resolution losses caused by interpolation. Volume
   upsampling also serves to improve motion estimation accuracy, which
   helps to reduce blur. Moreover, we demonstrate that the level of spatial
   blurring is nonuniform over the brain-knowledge which is critical for
   interpreting data in high-resolution fMRI studies. Importantly, our
   study provides recommendations for reducing unwanted blurring during
   preprocessing as well as methods that enable quantitative comparisons
   between preprocessing strategies. These findings highlight several
   underappreciated sources of a spatial blur. Individually, the factors
   that contribute to spatial blur may appear to be minor, but in
   combination, the cumulative effects can hinder the interpretation of
   fine-scale fMRI and the detectability of these fine-scale features of
   functional architecture.},

Title = {A New Type of Fuzzy-Rule-Based System With Chaotic Swarm Intelligence
   for Multiclassification of Pain Perception From fMRI},

Abstract = {Machine learning has been increasingly used in decoding brain states
   from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One important
   application is to classify the levels of pain perception from patients'
   fMRI for clinical pain assessment. However, the huge number of fMRI
   features and the complex relationships between fMRI and pain levels
   affect the performance of pain classification models heavily. In this
   article, we introduce a new fuzzy-rule-based hybrid optimization
   approach for dimension reduction and multiclassification problems using
   chaotic map, crow search optimization (CSO), and self-organizing fuzzy
   logic prototype (SOFLP). The approach is named as CCSO-SOFLP. In the
   proposed approach, chaotic map-based CSO is employed to find the optimal
   features from ultra-high-dimensional fMRI, and the fuzzy-rule-based
   SOFLP is employed for multiclassification of pain levels. In this sense,
   CSO is provided to avoid being stuck in local minima and to increase the
   computational performance. On the other hand, multilayer SOFLP
   classifier can continuously learn from new data and identify prototypes
   from the observed data and use them to build fuzzy rules, to define a
   suitable local area for each prototype, and to avoid overlapping. The
   proposed approach is applied on a pain-evoked fMRI data set to classify
   the levels of pain. Results indicate that the proposed approach can
   decode levels of pain and identify predictive fMRI patterns with higher
   accuracy and convergence speed and shorter execution time. Therefore,
   the new type of fuzzy-rule-based system with chaotic swarm intelligence
   holds great potential to predict pain perception in clinical uses.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Although distinct categories are reliably decoded from fMRI brain
   responses, it has proved more difficult to distinguish visually similar
   inputs, such as different faces. Here, we apply a recently developed
   deep learning system to reconstruct face images from human fMRI. We
   trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE) neural network using a GAN
   (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised procedure over a large
   data set of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder latent space provides a
   meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional description of each
   image. We then presented several thousand faces to human subjects, and
   learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel fMRI activation
   patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied this
   mapping to novel test images, translating fMRI patterns into VAE latent
   codes, and codes into face reconstructions. The system not only
   performed robust pairwise decoding(> 95\% correct), but also accurate
   gender classification, and even decoded which face was imagined, rather
   than seen.},

   by repeated exposure. Secondly, we review the types of group-level
   analyses that can be conducted on longitudinal fMRI data, analyses which
   must account for repeated measures. Finally, we review and critique
   recent longitudinal studies that have emerged in the past few years.},

Title = {Functional MRI and electrical stimulation mapping for language
   localization: A comparative meta-analysis},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the
   diagnostic validity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   compared to electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) for pre-surgical
   language mapping. Methods: A structured literature search was performed
   and studies with electrode-level data comparing fMRI and ESM for
   language localization were analyzed. Outcome measures included pooled
   estimates of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, and specificity.
   Sources of heterogeneity were explored with a meta-regression framework.
   Results: Nine studies were included in the analysis having 5-40 patients
   with mean age 11.3-43.4 years. Verb generation and picture naming were
   the most common fMRI tasks, while picture naming was the most common ESM
   task. Sensitivity (0.37-0.95), specificity (0.36-0.97), and DOR
   (1.9-44.6) for fMRI compared to ESM varied widely across studies with
   statistically significant heterogeneities. Pooled estimates were:
   sensitivity 0.71 (95\% confidence interval 0.54, 0.83), specificity 0.74
   (0.58, 0.85), and DOR 7.0 (3.5, 13.8), from a valid meta-analysis (area
   under the summary receiver-operating-curve 0.78). fMRI was noted to have
   higher sensitivity in studies using higher maximal ESM currents. fMRI
   variables could not be included in the meta-regression because of
   substantial methodological differences among studies. Conclusions: fMRI
   is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for language
   localization compared to ESM in well-designed studies. However, because
   the confidence limits for sensitivity and DOR are close to the line of
   no effect, and there is high unmeasured heterogeneity, fMRI cannot
   perhaps be used as the only modality for language localization to inform
   neurosurgical decisions at present.},

Title = {Concurrent TMS-fMRI for causal network perturbation and proof of target
   engagement},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The experimental manipulation of neural activity by neurostimulation
   techniques overcomes the inherent limitations of correlative recordings,
   enabling the researcher to investigate causal brain-behavior
   relationships. But only when stimulation and recordings are combined,
   the direct impact of the stimulation on neural activity can be
   evaluated. In humans, this can be achieved non-invasively through the
   concurrent combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Concurrent TMS-fMRI allows
   the assessment of the neurovascular responses evoked by TMS with
   excellent spatial resolution and full-brain coverage. This enables the
   functional mapping of both local and remote network effects of TMS in
   cortical as well as deep subcortical structures, offering unique
   opportunities for basic research and clinical applications. The purpose
   of this review is to introduce the reader to this powerful tool. We will
   introduce the technical challenges and state-of-the art solutions and
   provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and the
   available experimental approaches. We will highlight the unique insights
   that can be gained from concurrent TMS-fMRI, including the
   state-dependent assessment of neural responsiveness and inter-regional
   effective connectivity, the demonstration of functional target
   engagement, and the systematic evaluation of stimulation parameters. We
   will also discuss how concurrent TMS-fMRI during a behavioral task can
   help to link behavioral TMS effects to changes in neural network
   activity and to identify peripheral co-stimulation confounds. Finally,
   we will review the use of concurrent TMS-fMRI for developing TMS
   treatments of psychiatric and neurological disorders and suggest future
   improvements for further advancing the application of concurrent
   TMS-fMRI.},

Title = {Brain Atrophy Can Introduce Age-Related Differences in BOLD Response},
Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in studies of aging
   is often hampered by uncertainty about age-related differences in the
   amplitude and timing of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   response (i.e., hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF)). Such
   uncertainty introduces a significant challenge in the interpretation of
   the fMRI results. Even though this issue has been extensively
   investigated in the field of neuroimaging, there is currently no
   consensus about the existence and potential sources of age-related
   hemodynamic alterations. Using an event-related fMRI experiment with two
   robust and well-studied stimuli (visual and auditory), we detected a
   significant age-related difference in the amplitude of response to
   auditory stimulus. Accounting for brain atrophy by circumventing spatial
   normalization and processing the data in subjects' native space
   eliminated these observed differences. In addition, we simulated fMRI
   data using age differences in brain morphology while controlling HRF
   shape. Analyzing these simulated fMRI data using standard image
   processing resulted in differences in HRF amplitude, which were
   eliminated when the data were analyzed in subjects' native space. Our
   results indicate that age-related atrophy introduces inaccuracy in
   co-registration to standard space, which subsequently appears as
   attenuation in BOLD response amplitude. Our finding could explain some
   of the existing contradictory reports regarding age-related differences
   in the fMRI BOLD responses. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   New method: We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the
   following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the
   underlying hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled
   nonparametrically with a Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by
   physiological information and (iii) the predicted BOLD is not
   necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We place
   a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD response, rather than on the
   hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This allows us
   to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a
   flexible way, and simultaneously gives us the nonparametric flexibility
   of the GP.
   Results: Results on simulated data show that the proposed model is able
   to discriminate between active and nonactive voxels also when the GP
   prior deviates from the true hemodynamics. Our model finds time varying
   dynamics when applied to real fMRI data.
   Comparison with existing method(s): The proposed model is better at
   detecting activity in simulated data than standard models, without
   inflating the false positive rate. When applied to real fMRI data, our
   GP model in several cases finds brain activity where previously proposed
   LTI models does not.
   Conclusions: We have proposed a new non-linear model for the
   hemodynamics in task fMRI, that is able to detect active voxels, and
   gives the opportunity to ask new kinds of questions related to
   hemodynamics.},

Abstract = {General Linear Modeling (GLM) is the most commonly used method for
   signal detection in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
   experiments, despite its main limitation of not taking into
   consideration common spatial dependencies between voxels. Multivariate
   analysis methods, such as Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis
   (gCCA), have been increasingly employed in fMRI data analysis, due to
   their ability to overcome this limitation. This study, evaluates the
   improvement of sensitivity of the GLM, by applying gCCA to fMRI data
   after standard preprocessing steps. Data from a block-design fMRI
   experiment was used, where 25 healthy volunteers completed two action
   observation tasks at 1.5T. Whole brain analysis results indicated that
   the application of gCCA resulted in significantly higher intensity of
   activation in several regions in both tasks and helped reveal activation
   in the primary somatosensory and ventral premotor area, theoretically
   known to become engaged during action observation. In subject-level ROI
   analyses, gCCA improved the signal to noise ratio in the averaged
   timeseries in each preselected ROI, and resulted in increased extent of
   activation, although peak intensity was considerably higher in just two
   of them. In conclusion, gCCA is a promising method for improving the
   sensitivity of conventional statistical modeling in task related fMRI
   experiments.},

Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging emerged with great promise and has provided
   fundamental insights into the neurobiology of schizophrenia. However, it
   has faced challenges and criticisms, most notably a lack of clinical
   translation. This paper provides a comprehensive review and critical
   summary of the literature on functional neuroimaging, in particular
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in schizophrenia. We begin
   by reviewing research on fMRI biomarkers in schizophrenia and the
   clinical high risk phase through a historical lens, moving from
   case-control regional brain activation to global connectivity and
   advanced analytical approaches, and more recent machine learning
   algorithms to identify predictive neuroimaging features. Findings from
   fMRI studies of negative symptoms as well as of neurocognitive and
   social cognitive deficits are then reviewed. Functional neural markers
   of these symptoms and deficits may represent promising treatment targets
   in schizophrenia. Next, we summarize fMRI research related to
   antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions,
   and neurostimulation, including treatment response and resistance,
   therapeutic mechanisms, and treatment targeting. We also review the
   utility of fMRI and data-driven approaches to dissect the heterogeneity
   of schizophrenia, moving beyond case-control comparisons, as well as
   methodological considerations and advances, including consortia and
   precision fMRI. Lastly, limitations and future directions of research in
   the field are discussed. Our comprehensive review suggests that, in
   order for fMRI to be clinically useful in the care of patients with
   schizophrenia, research should address potentially actionable clinical
   decisions that are routine in schizophrenia treatment, such as which
   antipsychotic should be prescribed or whether a given patient is likely
   to have persistent functional impairment. The potential clinical utility
   of fMRI is influenced by and must be weighed against cost and
   accessibility factors. Future evaluations of the utility of fMRI in
   prognostic and treatment response studies may consider including a
   health economics analysis.},

Title = {Functional MRI Readouts From BOLD and Diffusion Measurements
   Differentially Respond to Optogenetic Activation and Tissue Heating},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Functional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI provides a
   brain-wide readout that depends on the hemodynamic response to neuronal
   activity. Diffusion fMRI has been proposed as an alternative to BOLD
   fMRI and has been postulated to directly rely on neuronal activity.
   These complementary functional readouts are versatile tools to be
   combined with optogenetic stimulation to investigate networks of the
   brain. The cell-specificity and temporal precision of optogenetic
   manipulations promise to enable further investigation of the origin of
   fMRI signals. The signal characteristics of the diffusion fMRI readout
   vice versa may better resolve network effects of optogenetic
   stimulation. However, the light application needed for optogenetic
   stimulation is accompanied by heat deposition within the tissue. As both
   diffusion and BOLD are sensitive to temperature changes, light
   application can lead to apparent activations confounding the
   interpretation of fMRI data. The degree of tissue heating, the
   appearance of apparent activation in different fMRI sequences and the
   origin of these phenomena are not well understood. Here, we disentangled
   apparent activations in BOLD and diffusion measurements in rats from
   physiological activation upon sensory or optogenetic stimulation. Both,
   BOLD and diffusion fMRI revealed similar signal shapes upon sensory
   stimulation that differed clearly from those upon heating. Apparent
   activations induced by high-intensity light application were dominated
   by T-2{*}-effects and resulted in mainly negative signal changes. We
   estimated that even low-intensity light application used for optogenetic
   stimulation reduces the BOLD response close to the fiber by up to 0.4\%.
   The diffusion fMRI signal contained T-2, T-2{*} and diffusion
   components. The apparent diffusion coefficient, which reflects the
   isolated diffusion component, showed negative changes upon both
   optogenetic and electric forepaw stimulation. In contrast, positive
   changes were detected upon high-intensity light application and thus
   ruled out heating as a major contributor to the diffusion fMRI signal.},

Abstract = {Network-Targeted Approach and Postoperative Resting-State Functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging Are Associated With Seizure Outcome
   Boerwinkle VL, Cediel EG, Mirea L, et al. Ann Neurol.
   2019;86(3):344-356. Objective: Postoperative resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with intractable epilepsy
   has not been quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its
   value as a biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood.
   Methods: In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent
   prospective resting-state seizure onset zone (SOZ)-targeted epilepsy
   surgery, postoperative resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was
   performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the
   postoperative resting-state SOZ was compared to seizure outcomes,
   patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics. Results: A total
   of 64 cases were evaluated. Network-targeted surgery, followed by
   postoperative rs-fMRI normalization was significantly (P < .001)
   correlated with seizure reduction, with a Spearman rank correlation
   coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with postoperative rs-fMRI SOZ
   normalization, 38 (97\%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of
   the 25 cases without complete rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5\%)
   became seizure free. The accuracy of rs-fMRI as a biomarker predicting
   seizure freedom is 94\%, with 96\% sensitivity and 93\% specificity.
   Interpretation: Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric
   epilepsy, network-targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs-fMRI
   normalization, has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study
   shows that rs-fMRI SOZ can be used as a biomarker for the epileptogenic
   zone, and postoperative rs-fMRI normalization is a biomarker for SOZ
   quiescence.},

   Bimodal mapping supports motor area reorganization in glioma patients},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {14},

Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Introduction
   Preoperative functional mapping in the vicinity of brain lesion is of
   high importance for avoiding complications in surgical management.
   However, space-occupying lesions may lead to functional reorganization
   or decreased BOLD activity.
   Methods
   Therefore in 13 patients with cerebral gliomas or brain arterio-venous
   malformations/hemangioma fMRI- and MEG-based cortical localizations of
   motor and somatosensory cortical activation pattern were compared in
   order to investigate their congruency.
   Results
   Localization of cortical sensorimotor areas with fMRI and MEG showed
   good congruency with a mean spatial distance of around 10 mm, with
   differences depending on the localization method. The smallest mean
   differences for the centroids were found for MEF with MNE 8 mm and SEF
   with sLORETA 8 mm. Primary motor area (M1) reorganization was found in 5
   of 12 patients in fMRI and confirmed with MEG data. In these 5 patients
   with M1-reorganization the distance between the border of the fMRI-based
   cortical M1-localization and the tumor border on Tlw MR images varied
   between 0-4 mm, which was significant (P = 0.025) different to the
   distance in glioma patients without M1-reorganization (5-26 mm).
   Conclusion
   Our multimodal preoperative mapping approach combining fMRI and MEG
   reveals a high degree of spatial congruence and provided high evidence
   for the presence of motor cortex reorganization.},

Title = {How much of the BOLD-fMRI signal can be approximated from simultaneous
   EEG data: relevance for the transfer and dissemination of neurofeedback
   interventions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Objective.fMRI-based neurofeedback (NF) interventions represent the
   method of choice for the neuromodulation of localized brain areas.
   Although we have already validated an fMRI-NF protocol targeting the
   facial expressions processing network (FEPN), its dissemination is
   hampered by the economical and logistical constraints of fMRI-NF
   interventions, which may be however surpassed by transferring it to EEG
   setups, due to their low cost and portability. One of the major
   challenges of this procedure is then to reconstruct the BOLD-fMRI signal
   measured at the FEPN using only EEG signals. Because these types of
   approaches have been poorly explored so far, here we systematically
   investigated the extent at which the BOLD-fMRI signal recorded from the
   FEPN during a fMRI-NF protocol could be reconstructed from the
   simultaneously recorded EEG signal.Approach.Several features from both
   scalp and source spaces (the latter estimated using continuous EEG
   source imaging) were extracted and used as predictors in a regression
   problem using random forests. Furthermore, three different approaches to
   deal with the hemodynamic delay of the BOLD signal were tested. The
   resulting models were compared with the only approach already proposed
   in the literature that uses spectral features and considers different
   time delays.Main results.The combination of linear and non-linear
   features (particularly the largest Lyapunov exponent and entropy
   measures) projected into the source space, spatially filtered by
   independent component analysis (ICA) and convolved with multiple HRF
   functions peaking at different latencies, increases significantly the
   reconstruction accuracy (defined as the correlation between the measured
   and approximated BOLD signal) from 20\% (direct comparison with the
   method used in the current literature) to 56\%.Significance.With this
   pipeline, a more accurate reconstruction of the BOLD signal can be
   obtained, which will positively impact the transfer of fMRI-based
   neurofeedback interventions to EEG setups, and more importantly, their
   dissemination and efficacy in modulating the activity of the desired
   brain areas.},

Abstract = {Resting-state fMRI is widely used to study brain function and
   connectivity. However, interpreting patterns of resting state (RS) fMRI
   activity remains challenging as they may arise from different neuronal
   mechanisms than those triggered by exogenous events. Currently, this
   limits the use of RS-fMRI for understanding cortical function in health
   and disease. Here, we examine the phase synchronization (PS) properties
   of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals obtained during visual
   field mapping (VFM) and RS with 7T fMRI. This data-driven approach
   exploits spatiotemporal covariations in the phase of BOLD recordings to
   establish the presence of clusters of synchronized activity. We find
   that, in both VFM and RS data, selecting the most synchronized
   neighboring recording sites identifies spatially localized PS clusters
   that follow the topographic organization of the visual cortex. However,
   in activity obtained during VFM, PS is spatially more extensive than in
   RS activity, likely reflecting stimulus-driven interactions between
   local responses. Nevertheless, the similarity of the PS clusters
   obtained for RS and stimulus-driven fMRI suggest that they share a
   common neuroanatomical origin. Our finding justifies and facilitates
   direct comparison of RS and stimulus-evoked activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Time-varying spectral power of resting-state fMRI networks reveal
   cross-frequency dependence in dynamic connectivity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Brain oscillations and synchronicity among brain regions (brain
   connectivity) have been studied in resting-state (RS) and task-induced
   settings. RS-connectivity which captures brain functional integration
   during an unconstrained state is shown to vary with the frequency of
   oscillations. Indeed, high temporal resolution modalities have
   demonstrated both between and cross-frequency connectivity spanning
   across frequency bands such as theta and gamma. Despite high spatial
   resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suffers from
   low temporal resolution due to modulation with slow-varying hemodynamic
   response function (HRF) and also relatively low sampling rate. This
   limits the range of detectable frequency bands in fMRI and consequently
   there has been no evidence of cross frequency dependence in fMRI data.
   In the present work we uncover recurring patterns of spectral power in
   network timecourses which provides new insight on the actual nature of
   frequency variation in fMRI network activations. Moreover, we introduce
   a new measure of dependence between pairs of rs-fMRI networks which
   reveals significant cross-frequency dependence between functional brain
   networks specifically default-mode, cerebellar and visual networks. This
   is the first strong evidence of cross-frequency dependence between
   functional networks in fMRI and our subject group analysis based on age
   and gender supports usefulness of this observation for future clinical
   applications.},

Abstract = {Resting-state fMRI has the potential to help doctors detect abnormal
   behavior in brain activity and to diagnose patients with depression.
   However, resting-state fMRI has a bias depending on the scanner site,

   paper, we propose methods to improve the performance of the diagnosis of
   major depressive disorder (MDD) at an independent site by reducing the
   site bias effects using regression. For this, we used a subgroup of
   healthy subjects of the independent site to regress out site bias. We
   further improved the classification performance of patients with
   depression by focusing on melancholic depressive disorder. Our proposed
   methods would be useful to apply depression classifiers to subjects at
   completely new sites.},

Abstract = {BOLD fMRI is widely applied in human neuroscience but is limited in its
   spatial specificity due to a cortical-depth-dependent venous bias. This
   reduces its localization specificity with respect to neuronal responses,
   a disadvantage for neuroscientific research. Here, we modified a
   submillimeter BOLD protocol to selectively reduce venous and tissue
   signal and increase cerebral blood volume weighting through a pulsed
   saturation scheme (dubbed Arterial Blood Contrast) at 7 T. Adding
   Arterial Blood Contrast on top of the existing BOLD contrast modulated
   the intracortical contrast. Isolating the Arterial Blood Contrast showed
   a response free of pial-surface bias. The results suggest that Arterial
   Blood Contrast can modulate the typical fMRI spatial specificity, with
   important applications in in-vivo neuroscience.},

Title = {The value of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for
   detecting epileptogenic zones in patients with focal epilepsy},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Objective
   To determine the value of resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (RS-fMRI) based on the local analysis methods regional
   homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and
   fractional ALFF (fALFF), for detecting epileptogenic zones (EZs).
   Methods
   A total of 42 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy were enrolled.
   Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative
   predictive value (NPV) of visually assessed RS-fMRI, MRI, magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (MRS), video electroencephalography (VEEG), and
   positron-emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) in EZ
   localization were evaluated to assess their diagnostic abilities. ReHo,
   ALFF, and fALFF were also compared for their diagnostic values.
   Results
   RS-fMRI showed comparable sensitivity to PET (83.3\%) and specificity to
   VEEG (66.7\%), respectively, for EZ localization in patients with focal
   epilepsy. There were no significant differences between RS-fMRI and the
   other localization techniques in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
   and NPV. The sensitivities of ReHo, ALFF, and fALFF were 69.4\%, 52.8\%,
   and 38.9\%, respectively, and for specificities of 66.7\%, 83.3\%, and
   66.7\%, respectively. There were no significant differences among ReHo,
   ALFF, and fALFF, except that ReHo was more sensitive than fALFF.
   Conclusions
   RS-fMRI may be an efficient tool for detecting EZs in focal epilepsy
   patients.},

Title = {Precision medicine in pediatric temporal epilepsy surgery: optimization
   of outcomes through functional MRI memory tasks and tailored surgeries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE The goal of epilepsy surgery is both seizure cessation and
   maximal preservation of function. In temporal lobe (TL) cases, the lack
   of functional MRI (fMRI) tasks that effectively activate mesial temporal
   structures hampers pre-operative memory risk assessment, especially in
   children. This study evaluated pediatric TL surgery outcome
   optimiza-tion associated with tailored resection informed by an fMRI
   memory task.METHODS The authors identified focal onset TL epilepsy
   patients with 1) TL resections; 2) viable fMRI memory scans; and 3)
   pre-and postoperative neuropsychological (NP) evaluations. They
   retrospectively evaluated preoperative fMRI memory scans, available Wada
   tests, pre-and postoperative NP scores, postoperative MRI scans, and
   postoperative Engel class outcomes. To assess fMRI memory task outcome
   prediction, the authors 1) overlaid preoperative fMRI activation onto
   postoperative structural images; 2) classified patients as having
   ``overlap{''} or ``no overlap{''} of activation and resection cavities;
   and 3) compared these findings with memory improvement, stability, or
   decline, based on Reliable Change Index calculations.RESULTS Twenty
   patients met the inclusion criteria. At a median of 2.1 postoperative
   years, 16 patients had Engel class IA outcomes and 1 each had Engel
   class IB, ID, IIA, and IID outcomes. Functional MRI activation was
   linked to NP memory outcome in 19 of 20 cases (95\%). Otherwise,
   heterogeneity characterized the cohort.CONCLUSIONS Functional MRI memory
   task activation effectively predicted individual NP outcomes in the
   context of tailored TL resections. Patients had excellent seizure and
   overall good NP outcomes. This small study adds to extant literature
   indicating that pediatric TL epilepsy does not represent a single
   clinical syndrome. Findings support individual-ized surgical
   intervention using fMRI memory activation to help guide this precision
   medicine approach.},

Title = {Resting-state network mapping in neurosurgical practice: a review},
Journal = {NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a well-established method for
   studying intrinsic connectivity and mapping the topography of functional
   networks in the human brain. In the clinical setting, rs-fMRI has been
   used to define functional topography, typically language and motor
   systems, in the context of preoperative planning for neurosurgery.
   Intraoperative mapping of critical speech and motor areas with
   electrocortical stimulation (ECS) remains standard practice, but
   preoperative noninvasive mapping has the potential to reduce operative
   time and provide functional localization when awake mapping is not
   feasible. Task-based fMRI has historically been used for this purpose,
   but it can be limited by the young age of the patient, cognitive
   impairment, poor cooperation, and need for sedation. Resting-state fMRI
   allows reliable analysis of all functional networks with a single study
   and is inherently independent of factors affecting task performance. In
   this review, the authors provide a summary of the theory and methods for
   resting-state network mapping. They provide case examples illustrating
   clinical implementation and discuss limitations of rs-fMRI and review
   available data regarding performance in comparison to ECS. Finally, they
   discuss novel opportunities for future clinical applications and
   prospects for rs-fMRI beyond mapping of regions to avoid during surgery
   but, instead, as a tool to guide novel network-based therapies.},

Abstract = {EEG-fMRI data fusion provides a better insight of the brain activity due
   to its high spatiotemporal resolution. The current paper presents a new
   framework on EEG-fMRI data using symmetric data fusion based on Dempster
   Shafer theory. Basically, symmetric methods require the use of a common
   theoretical model to explore Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data jointly. Dempster Shafer theory
   has a multivariate use in resolving problems related to uncertainty.
   Accordingly, Basic Belief Assignment and the combination rule offered by
   such theory allow fusing multimodel sources such EEG (temporal modality)
   and fMRI (spatial modality). In particular, mass functions for each
   modality have been calculated. Then, the combination rule has been
   computed. Finally, this measure has been used to detect the activated
   areas in the brain via clustering using the potential-based hierarchical
   agglomerative clustering method. Both real auditory and artificial data
   simulation have been employed to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed approach. Also, true, false activation rates and Receiver
   Operating Characteristic (ROC curve) have been used to establish a
   comparison with jointICA method. The obtained results have clearly shown
   the ability of the introduced approach to outperform a standard method
   of data analysis to reveal a better activation map.},

Title = {Reconstructing natural images from human fMRI by alternating encoding
   and decoding with shared autoencoder regularization},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Reconstructing the viewed natural images from the corresponding
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of human visual cortices is
   extremely difficult. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the quality of
   reconstructed images can be significantly improved. This however is
   subject to availability of sufficient number of pair samples, which is
   not currently the case. In this study, we propose to perform alternating
   encoding and decoding to realize the mutual promotion of both based on
   shared semi-supervised learning and accomplish better reconstruction of
   natural images from the corresponding fMRI voxels. In our proposed
   method, the encoder and decoder are used to respectively map the images
   to the fMRI voxels (visual encoding), and the fMRI voxels to the images
   (visual reconstruction). We argue that combining the encoder and decoder
   in different sequences can form two converse and shared autoencoders to
   regularize the supervised learning of both through the unsupervised
   learning of fMRI voxels and images. More importantly, we alternatingly
   train the encoder and decoder with shared autoencoder regularization.
   Here, the premise is that a better encoder can produce a better decoder,
   and vice versa. The pixel level identification of the proposed method
   achieves up to 89.5\%, which indicates at least 2\% superiority and is
   the new state-of-the-art compared to the previous works in terms of the
   image reconstruction performance.},

Abstract = {Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM) is a degenerative condition that
   leads to loss of cervical spinal cord integrity, typically affecting the
   aged population. Emerging fMRI-based evidence suggests that the brain is
   also affected by CSM. This systematic review aimed to understand the
   usefulness of brain fMRI in CSM. A comprehensive literature search was
   conducted until March 2023 according to PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion
   criteria included original research articles in English, primarily
   studying the human brain's functional changes in CSM using fMRI with at
   least 5 participants. The extracted data from each study included
   demographics, disease severity, MRI machine characteristics, affected
   brain areas, functional changes, and clinical utilities. A total of 30
   studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the fMRI methods,
   resting-state fMRI was the most widely used experimental paradigm,
   followed by motor tasks. The brain areas associated with motor control
   were most affected in CSM, followed by the superior frontal gyrus and
   occipital cortex. Functional changes in the brain were correlated to
   clinical metrics showing clinical utility. However, the evidence that a
   specific fMRI metric correlating with a clinical metric was ``very
   low{''} to ``insufficient{''} due to a low number of studies and
   negative results. In conclusion, fMRI can potentially facilitate the
   diagnosis of CSM by quantitatively interrogating the functional changes
   of the brain, particularly areas of the brain associated with motor
   control. However, this field is in its early stages, and more studies
   are needed to establish the usefulness of brain fMRI in CSM.},

Abstract = {Preprocessing fMRI data requires striking a fine balance between
   conserving signals of interest and removing noise. Typical steps of
   preprocessing include motion correction, slice timing correction,
   spatial smoothing, and high-pass filtering. However, these standard
   steps do not remove many sources of noise. Thus, noise-reduction
   techniques, for example, CompCor, FIX, and ICA-AROMA have been developed
   to further improve the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the
   data. The ability of these techniques to minimize noise while conserving
   signals of interest has been tested almost exclusively in resting-state
   fMRI and, only rarely, in task-related fMRI. Application of
   noise-reduction techniques to task-related fMRI is particularly
   important given that such procedures have been shown to reduce false
   positive rates. Little remains known about the impact of these
   techniques on the retention of signal in tasks that may be associated
   with systemic physiological changes. In this paper, we compared two
   ICA-based, that is FIX and ICA-AROMA, two CompCor-based noise-reduction
   techniques, that is aCompCor, and tCompCor, and standard preprocessing
   using a large (n = 101) fMRI dataset including noxious heat and
   non-noxious auditory stimulation. Results show that preprocessing using
   FIX performs optimally for data obtained using noxious heat, conserving
   more signals than CompCor-based techniques and ICA-AROMA, while removing
   only slightly less noise. Similarly, for data obtained during
   non-noxious auditory stimulation, FIX noise-reduction technique before
   analysis with a covariate of interest outperforms the other techniques.
   These results indicate that FIX might be the most appropriate technique
   to achieve the balance between conserving signals of interest and
   removing noise during task-related fMRI.},

Title = {Analyzing Neuroimaging Data Through Recurrent Deep Learning Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {The application of deep learning (DL) models to neuroimaging data poses
   several challenges, due to the high dimensionality, low sample size, and
   complex temporo-spatial dependency structure of these data. Even
   further, DL models often act as black boxes, impeding insight into the
   association of cognitive state and brain activity. To approach these
   challenges, we introduce the DeepLight framework, which utilizes long
   short-term memory (LSTM) based DL models to analyze whole-brain
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. To decode a cognitive
   state (e.g., seeing the image of a house), DeepLight separates an fMRI
   volume into a sequence of axial brain slices, which is then sequentially
   processed by an LSTM. To maintain interpretability, DeepLight adapts the
   layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique. Thereby, decomposing
   its decoding decision into the contributions of the single input voxels
   to this decision. Importantly, the decomposition is performed on the
   level of single fMRI volumes, enabling DeepLight to study the
   associations between cognitive state and brain activity on several
   levels of data granularity, from the level of the group down to the
   level of single time points. To demonstrate the versatility of
   DeepLight, we apply it to a large fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome
   Project. We show that DeepLight outperforms conventional approaches of
   uni- and multivariate fMRI analysis in decoding the cognitive states and
   in identifying the physiologically appropriate brain regions associated
   with these states. We further demonstrate DeepLight's ability to study
   the fine-grained temporo-spatial variability of brain activity over
   sequences of single fMRI samples.},

Title = {Longitudinal observations using simultaneous fMRI, multiple channel
   electrophysiology recording, and chemical microiontophoresis in the rat
   brain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {306},
Pages = {68-76},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background: fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal has
   been widely used as a surrogate for neural activity. However,
   interpreting differences in BOLD fMRI based on underlying neuronal
   activity remains a challenge. Concurrent rsMRI data collection and
   electrophysiological recording in combination with
   microiontophoretically injected modulatory chemicals allows for improved
   understanding of the relationship between resting state BOLD and
   neuronal activity.
   New Methods: Simultaneous fMRI, multi-channel intracortical
   electrophysiology and focal pharmacological manipulation data to be
   acquired longitudinally in rats for up to 2 months. Our artifact
   replacing technique is optimized for combined LFP and rsMRI data
   collection.
   Results: Intracortical implantation of a multichannel microelectrode
   array resulted in minimal distortion and signal loss in fMRI images
   inside a 9.4T MRI scanner. rsMRI-induced electrophysiology artifacts
   were replaced using an in-house developed algorithm. Microinjection of
   AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) enhanced
   dopaminergic neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
   altered LFP signal and fMRI functional connectivity in the striatum.
   Comparisons with Existing Method(s): Nanomanufacturing advances permit
   the production of MRI-compatible microelectrode arrays (with 16 or more
   channels), extending research beyond conventional methods limited to
   fewer channels. Our method permits longitudinal data collection of LFP
   and rsMRI and our algorithm effectively detects and replaces
   fMRI-induced electrophysiological noise, permitting rsMRI data
   collection concomitant with LFP recordings.
   Conclusions: Our model consists of longitudinal concurrent fMRI and
   multichannel intracortical electrophysiological recording during
   microinjection of pharmacological agents to modulate neural activity in
   the rat brain. We used commercial micro-electrodes and recording system
   and can be readily generalized to other labs.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: This work investigates verbal memory functional
   MRI (fMRI) versus language fMRI in terms of lateralization, and assesses
   the validity of performing word recognition during the functional
   scan.Methods: Thirty patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy underwent
   verbal memory, visuospatial memory, and language fMRI. We used word
   encoding, word recognition, image encoding, and image recognition memory
   tasks, and semantic description, reading comprehension, and listening
   comprehension language tasks. We used three common lateralization
   metrics: network spatial distribution, maximum statistical value, and
   laterality index (LI).Results: Lateralization of signal spatial
   distribution resulted in poor similarity between verbal memory and
   language fMRI tasks. Signal maximum lateralization showed significant
   (>.8) but not perfect (1) similarity. Word encoding LI showed
   significant correlation only with listening comprehension LI (p = .016).
   Word recognition LI was significantly correlated with expressive
   language semantic description LI (p = .024) and receptive language
   reading and listening comprehension LIs (p = .015 and p = .019,
   respectively). There was no correlation between LIs of the visuospatial
   tasks and LIs of the language tasks.Conclusions: Our results support the
   association between language and verbal memory lateralization, optimally
   determined by LI quantification, and the introduction of quantitative
   means for language fMRI interpretation in clinical settings where verbal
   memory lateralization is imperative.},

Title = {Semiparametric modeling of time-varying activation and connectivity in
   task-based fMRI data},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {150},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there is a rise in
   evidence that time-varying functional connectivity, or dynamic
   functional connectivity (dFC), which measures changes in the
   synchronization of brain activity, provides additional information on
   brain networks not captured by time-invariant (i.e., static) functional
   connectivity. While there have been many developments for statistical
   models of dFC in resting-state fMRI, there remains a gap in the
   literature on how to simultaneously model both dFC and time-varying
   activation when the study participants are undergoing experimental tasks
   designed to probe at a cognitive process of interest. A method is
   proposed to estimate dFC between two regions of interest (ROIs) in
   task-based fMRI where the activation effects are also allowed to vary
   over time. The proposed method, called TVAAC (time-varying activation
   and connectivity), uses penalized splines to model both time-varying
   activation effects and time-varying functional connectivity and uses the
   bootstrap for statistical inference. Simulation studies show that TVAAC
   can estimate both static and time-varying activation and functional
   connectivity, while ignoring time-varying activation effects would lead
   to poor estimation of dFC. An empirical illustration is provided by
   applying TVAAC to analyze two subjects from an event-related fMRI
   learning experiment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {High isotropic resolution fMRI is challenging primarily due to long
   repetition times (TR) and insufficient SNR, especially at lower field
   strengths. Recently, Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS) imaging with
   blipped-CAIPI has substantially reduced scan time and improved SNR
   efficiency of fMRI. Similarly, super-resolution techniques utilizing
   sub-voxel spatial shifts in the slice direction have increased both
   resolution and SNR efficiency. Here we demonstrate the synergistic
   combination of SLIce Dithered Enhanced Resolution (SLIDER) and SMS for
   high-resolution, high-SNR whole brain fMRI in comparison to standard
   resolution fMRI data as well as high-resolution data. With SLIDER-SMS,
   high spatial frequency information is recovered (unaliased) even in
   absence of super-resolution deblurring algorithms. Additionally we find
   that BOLD CNR (as measured by t-value in a visual checkerboard paradigm)
   is improved by as much as 100\% relative to traditionally acquired
   high-resolution data. Using this gain in CNR, we are able to obtain
   unprecedented nominally isotropic resolutions at 3 T (0.66 mm) and 7 T
   (0.45 mm).},

Title = {A study of decoding human brain activities from simultaneous data of EEG
   and fMRI using MVPA},

Abstract = {Neuroscientists have investigated the functionality of the brain in
   detail and achieved remarkable results but this area still need further
   research. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is considered as
   the most reliable and accurate technique to decode the human brain
   activity, on the other hand electroencephalography (EEG) is a portable
   and low cost solution in brain research. The purpose of this study is to
   find whether EEG can be used to decode the brain activity patterns like
   fMRI. In fMRI, data from a very specific brain region is enough to
   decode the brain activity patterns due to the quality of data. On the
   other hand, EEG can measure the rapid changes in neuronal activity
   patterns due to its higher temporal resolution i.e., in msec. These
   rapid changes mostly occur in different brain regions. In this study,
   multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is used both for EEG and fMRI data
   analysis and the information is extracted from distributed activation
   patterns of the brain. The significant information among different
   classes is extracted using two sample t test in both data sets. Finally,
   the classification analysis is done using the support vector machine. A
   fair comparison of both data sets is done using the same analysis
   techniques, moreover simultaneously collected data of EEG and fMRI is
   used for this comparison. The final analysis is done with the data of
   eight participants; the average result of all conditions are found which
   is 65.7\% for EEG data set and 64.1\% for fMRI data set. It concludes
   that EEG is capable of doing brain decoding with the data from multiple
   brain regions. In other words, decoding accuracy with EEG MVPA is as
   good as fMRI MVPA and is above chance level.},

   networks},
Journal = {NEUROPHOTONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Brain functional connectivity based on the measure of blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   signals has become one of the most widely used measurements in human
   neuroimaging. However, the nature of the functional networks revealed by
   BOLD fMRI can be ambiguous, as highlighted by a recent series of
   experiments that have suggested that typical resting-state networks can
   be replicated from purely vascular or physiologically driven BOLD
   signals. After going through a brief review of the key concepts of brain
   network analysis, we explore how the vascular and neuronal systems
   interact to give rise to the brain functional networks measured with
   BOLD fMRI. This leads us to emphasize a view of the vascular network not
   only as a confounding element in fMRI but also as a functionally
   relevant system that is entangled with the neuronal network. To study
   the vascular and neuronal underpinnings of BOLD functional connectivity,
   we consider a combination of methodological avenues based on multiscale
   and multimodal optical imaging in mice, used in combination with
   computational models that allow the integration of vascular information
   to explain functional connectivity. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE

   Connectivity Than Magnitude fMRI},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Conventionally, brain function is inferred from the magnitude data of
   the complex-valued fMRI output. Since the fMRI phase image (unwrapped)
   provides a representation of brain internal magnetic fieldmap (by a
   constant scale difference), it can also be used to study brain function
   while providing a more direct representation of the brain's magnetic
   state. In this study, we collected a cohort of resting-state fMRI
   magnitude and phase data pairs from 600 subjects (age from 10 to 76, 346
   males), decomposed the phase data by group independent component
   analysis (pICA), calculated the functional network connectivity (pFNC).
   In comparison with the magnitude-based brain function analysis (mICA and
   mFNC), we find that the pFNC matrix contains fewer significant
   functional connections (with p-value thresholding) than the mFNC matrix,
   which are sparsely distributed across the whole brain with near/far
   interconnections and positive/negative correlations in rough balance. We
   also find a few of brain rest sub-networks within the phase data,
   primarily in subcortical, cerebellar, and visual regions. Overall, our
   findings offer new insights into brain function connectivity in the
   context of a focus on the brain's internal magnetic state.},

Title = {WHOCARES: WHOle-brain CArdiac signal REgression from highly accelerated
   simultaneous multi-Slice fMRI acquisitions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Objective. To spatio-temporally resolve cardiac signals in functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series of the human brain using
   neither external physiological measurements nor ad hoc modelling
   assumptions. Approach. Cardiac pulsation is a physiological confound of
   fMRI time-series that introduces spurious signal fluctuations in
   proximity to blood vessels. fMRI alone is not sufficiently fast to
   resolve cardiac pulsation. Depending on the ratio between the
   instantaneous heart-rate and the acquisition sampling frequency (1/TR,
   with TR being the repetition time), the cardiac signal may alias into
   the frequency band of neural activation so that its removal through
   spectral filtering techniques is generally not possible. In this paper,
   we show that it is feasible to temporally and spatially resolve cardiac
   signals throughout the brain even when cardiac aliasing occurs by
   combining fMRI hyper-sampling with simultaneous multislice (SMS)
   imaging. The technique, which we name WHOle-brain CArdiac signal
   REgression from highly accelerated simultaneous multi-Slice fMRI
   acquisitions (WHOCARES), was developed on 695 healthy subjects selected
   from the Human Connectome Project and its performance validated against
   the RETROICOR, HAPPY and the pulse oxymeter signal regression methods.
   Main results. WHOCARES is capable of retrieving voxel-wise cardiac
   signal regressors. This is achieved without employing external
   physiological recordings nor through ad hoc modelling assumptions. The
   performance of WHOCARES was, on average, superior to RETROICOR, HAPPY
   and the pulse oxymeter regression methods. Significance. WHOCARES holds
   basis for the reliable mapping of cardiac activity in fMRI time-series.
   WHOCARES can be employed for the retrospective removal of cardiac noise
   in publicly available fMRI datasets where physiological recordings are
   not available. WHOCARES is freely available at

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research is routinely
   criticized for being statistically underpowered due to
   characteristically small sample sizes and much larger sample sizes are
   being increasingly recommended. Additionally, various sources of
   artifact inherent in fMRI data can have detrimental impact on effect
   size estimates and statistical power. Here we show how specific removal
   of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical
   power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the
   social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD
   variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and
   statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition
   and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Without smoothing,
   group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks
   were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24\% in regions canonically
   associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts
   (40-149\%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. Effect size
   boosting occurs via reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level and
   consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level.
   Smoothing can attenuate ME-ICA-related effect size improvements in
   certain circumstances. Power simulations demonstrate that ME-ICA-related
   effect size enhancements enable much higher-powered studies at
   traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying
   ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional
   sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic
   non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size
   estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could
   mitigate some issues regarding statistical power in fMRI studies and
   enable novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are
   currently under-appreciated and not well understood. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Meditation attenuates default-mode activity: A pilot study using
   ultra-high field 7 Tesla MRI},
Journal = {BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Objectives: Mapping the neurobiology of meditation has been bolstered by
   functional MRI (fMRI) research, with advancements in ultra-high field 7
   Tesla fMRI further enhancing signal quality and neuroanatomical
   resolution. Here, we utilize 7 Tesla fMRI to examine the neural
   substrates of meditation and replicate existing widespread findings,
   after accounting for relevant physiological confounds.Methods: In this
   feasibility study, we scanned 10 beginner meditators (N = 10) while they
   either attended to breathing (focused attention meditation) or engaged
   in restful thinking (non-focused rest). We also measured and adjusted
   the fMRI signal for key physiological differences between meditation and
   rest. Finally, we explored changes in state mindfulness, state anxiety
   and focused attention attributes for up to 2 weeks following the single
   fMRI meditation session.Results: Group-level task fMRI analyses revealed
   significant reductions in activity during meditation relative to rest in
   default-mode network hubs, i.e., antero-medial prefrontal and posterior
   cingulate cortices, precuneus, as well as visual and thalamic regions.
   These findings survived stringent statistical corrections for
   fluctuations in physiological responses which demonstrated significant
   differences (p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) between meditation and
   rest. Compared to baseline, State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores were
   significantly elevated (F (3,9) = 8.16, p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni
   controlled) following the fMRI meditation session, and were closely
   maintained at 2-week follow up.Conclusions: This pilot study establishes
   the feasibility and utility of investigating focused attention
   meditation using ultra-high field (7 Tesla) fMRI, by supporting
   widespread evidence that focused attention meditation attenuates
   default-mode activity responsible for self-referential processing.
   Future functional neuroimaging studies of meditation should control for
   physiological confounds and include behavioural assessments.},

Title = {Stimulus frequency modulates brainstem response to respiratory-gated
   transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation},
Journal = {BRAIN STIMULATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {970-978},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The therapeutic potential of transcutaneous auricular VNS
   (taVNS) is currently being explored for numerous clinical applications.
   However, optimized response for different clinical indications may
   depend on specific neuromodulation parameters, and systematic
   assessments of their influence are still needed to optimize this
   promising approach.
   Hypothesis: We proposed that stimulation frequency would have a
   significant effect on nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) functional MRI
   (fMRI) response to respiratory-gated taVNS (RAVANS).
   Methods: Brainstem fMRI response to auricular RAVANS (cymba conchae) was
   assessed for four different stimulation frequencies (2, 10, 25, 100 Hz).
   Sham (no current) stimulation was used to control for respiration
   effects on fMRI signal.
   Results: Our findings demonstrated that RAVANS delivered at 100 Hz
   evoked the strongest brainstem response, localized to a cluster in the
   left (ipsilateral) medulla and consistent with purported NTS. A
   co-localized, although weaker, response was found for 2 Hz RAVANS.
   Furthermore, RAVANS delivered at 100 Hz also evoked stronger fMRI
   responses for important monoamine neurotransmitter source nuclei (LC,
   noradrenergic; MR, DR, serotonergic) and pain/homeostatic regulation
   nuclei (i.e. PAG).
   Conclusion: Our fMRI results support previous localization of taVNS
   afference to pontomedullary aspect of NTS in the human brainstem, and
   demonstrate the significant influence of the stimulation frequency on
   brainstem fMRI response. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {Temporal non-local means filtering for studies of intrinsic brain
   connectivity from individual resting fMRI},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Characterizing functional brain connectivity using resting functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging due to the relatively
   small Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent contrast and low signal-to-noise
   ratio. Denoising using surface-based Laplace-Beltrami (LB) or volumetric
   Gaussian filtering tends to blur boundaries between different functional
   areas. To overcome this issue, a time-based Non-Local Means (tNLM)
   filtering method was previously developed to denoise fMRI data while
   preserving spatial structure. The kernel and parameters that define the
   tNLM filter need to be optimized for each application. Here we present a
   novel Global PDF-based tNLM filtering (GPDF) algorithm that uses a
   data-driven kernel function based on a Bayes factor to optimize
   filtering for spatial delineation of functional connectivity in resting
   fMRI data. We demonstrate its performance relative to Gaussian spatial
   filtering and the original tNLM filtering via simulations. We also
   compare the effects of GPDF filtering against LB filtering using
   individual in-vivo resting fMRI datasets. Our results show that LB
   filtering tends to blur signals across boundaries between adjacent
   functional regions. In contrast, GPDF filtering enables improved noise
   reduction without blurring adjacent functional regions. These results
   indicate that GPDF may be a useful preprocessing tool for analyses of
   brain connectivity and network topology in individual fMRI recordings.

Title = {Dominance of layer-specific microvessel dilation in contrast-enhanced
   high-resolution fMRI: Comparison between hemodynamic spread and vascular

Abstract = {Contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI response
   peaks are specific to the layer of evoked synaptic activity (Poplawsky a
   al., 2015), but the spatial resolution limit of CBVw fMRI is unknown. In
   this study, we measured the laminar spread of the CBVw fMRI evoked
   response in the external plexiform layer (EPL, 265 +/- 65 mu m
   anatomical thickness, mean +/- SD, n = 30 locations from 5 rats) of the
   rat olfactory bulb during electrical stimulation of the lateral
   olfactory tract and examined its potential vascular source. First, we
   obtained the evoked CBVw fMRI responses with a 55 x 55 mu m(2) in-plane
   resolution and a 500-mu m thickness at 9.4 T, and found that the fMRI
   signal peaked predominantly in the inner half of EPL (136 +/- 54 mu m
   anatomical thickness). The mean full-width at half-maximum of these fMRI
   peaks was 347 +/- 102 mu m and the functional spread was approximately
   100 or 200 mu m when the effects of the laminar thicknesses of EPL or
   inner EPL were removed, respectively. Second, we visualized the vascular
   architecture of EPL from a different rat using a Clear Lipid-exchanged
   Anatomically Rigid Imaging/immunostaining-compatible Tissue hYdrogel
   (CLARITY)-based tissue preparation method and confocal microscopy.
   Microvascular segments with an outer diameter of <11 mu m accounted for
   64.3\% of the total vascular volume within EPL and had a mean segment
   length of 55 +/- 40 mu m (n = 472). Additionally, vessels that crossed
   the EPL border had a mean segment length outside of EPL equal to 73 +/-
   61 mu m (n = 28), which is comparable to half of the functional spread
   (50-100 mu m). Therefore, we conclude that dilation of these
   microvessels, including capillaries, likely dominate the CBVw fMRI
   response and that the biological limit of the fMRI spatial resolution is
   approximately the average length of 1-2 microvessel segments, which may
   be sufficient for examining sublaminar circuits.},

Abstract = {Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) creates a rich four-dimensional
   data set that can be analyzed in a variety of ways. As more researchers
   come to view the brain as a complex dynamical system, tools are
   increasingly being drawn from other fields to characterize the
   complexity of the brain's activity. However, given that the signal
   measured with rs-fMRI arises from the hemodynamic response to neural
   activity, the extent to which complexity metrics reflect neural
   complexity as compared to signal properties related to image quality
   remains unknown. To provide some insight into this question, correlation
   dimension, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent were calculated for
   different rs-fMRI scans from the same subject to examine their
   reliability. The metrics of complexity were then compared to several
   properties of the rs-fMRI signal from each brain area to determine if
   basic signal features could explain differences in the complexity
   metrics. Differences in complexity across brain areas were highly
   reliable and were closely linked to differences in the frequency
   profiles of the rs-fMRI signal. The spatial distributions of the
   complexity and frequency metrics suggest that they are both influenced
   by location-dependent signal properties that can obscure changes related
   to neural activity.},

Abstract = {Resting-state (rs) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
   have revealed dysfunctional thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC)
   in schizophrenia. However, the relationship between thalamocortical FC
   and cognitive impairment has not been thoroughly investigated. We
   hypothesized that aberrant thalamocortical FC is related to attention
   deficits in schizophrenia. Thirty-eight patients with schizophrenia and
   38 matched healthy controls underwent rs-fMRI and task fMRI while
   performing a Flanker task. We observed decreased left thalamic
   activation in patients with schizophrenia using task fMRI to determine
   the thalamic seed. A seed-based analysis using this seed was performed
   in the whole brain to assess differences in thalamocortical FC between
   the groups. Significantly worse performance was observed in the patient
   group. The rs-fMRI analysis revealed significantly increased FC between
   the left thalamus seed and the occipital cortices/postcentral gyri in
   patients when compared to controls. In the patient group, significant
   positive correlations were observed between the degree of FC from the
   left thalamus to the bilateral occipital gyri, which correspond to the
   visual cortex, and the Flanker effect. No significant correlation was
   detected in the control group. These results indicate that aberrant FC
   between the left thalamus and the visual cortex is related to attention
   deficits in schizophrenia.},

Abstract = {This study addresses one long-standing question of whether functional
   separations are preserved for somatosensory modalities of touch, heat,
   and cold nociception within primate primary somatosensory (S1) cortex.
   This information is critical for understanding how the nature of pain is
   represented in the primate brain. Using a combination of
   submillimeter-resolution fMRI and microelectrode local field potential
   (LFP) and spike recordings, we identified spatially segregated cortical
   zones for processing touch and nociceptive heat and cold stimuli in
   somatotopically appropriate areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 of S1 in male
   monkeys. The distances between zones were comparable (similar to 3.4 mm)
   across stimulus modalities (heat, cold, and tactile), indicating the
   existence of uniform, modality-specific modules. Stimulus-evoked LFP
   maps validated the fMRI maps in areas 3b and 1. Isolation of heat and
   cold nociceptive neurons from the fMRI zones confirmed the validity of
   using fMRI to probe nociceptive regions and circuits. Resting-state fMRI
   analysis revealed distinct intrinsic functional circuits among
   functionally related zones. We discovered distinct modular structures
   and networks for thermal nociception within S1 cortex, a finding that
   has significant implications for studying chronic pain syndromes and
   guiding the selection of neuro-modulation targets for chronic pain
   management.},

Abstract = {Abnormal fMRI habituation in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been
   proposed as a critical component in social impairment. This study
   investigated habituation to fearful faces and houses in ASD and whether
   fMRI measures of brain activity discriminate between ASD and typically
   developing (TD) controls. Two identical fMRI runs presenting masked
   fearful faces, houses, and scrambled images were collected. We found
   significantly slower fMRI responses to fearful faces but not houses in
   ASD. In addition, the pattern of slow to emerge amygdala activation to
   faces had robust discriminability {[}ASD vs. TD; area under the curve
   (AUC) = .852, p < .001]. In contrast, habituation to houses had no
   predictive value (AUC = .573, p = .365). Amygdala habituation to
   emotional faces may be useful for quantifying risk in ASD.},

Title = {Custom 3D fMRI Registration Template Construction Method Based on
   Time-Series Fusion},
Journal = {DIAGNOSTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As the brain standard template for medical image registration has only
   been constructed with an MRI template, there is no three-dimensional
   fMRI standard template for use, and when the subject's brain structure
   is quite different from the standard brain structure, the registration
   to the standard space will lead to large errors. Registration to an
   individual space can avoid this problem. However, in the current fMRI
   registration algorithm based on individual space, the reference image is
   often selected by researchers or randomly selected fMRI images at a
   certain time point. This makes the quality of the reference image very
   dependent on the experience and ability of the researchers and has great
   contingency. Whether the reference image is appropriate and reasonable
   affects the rationality and accuracy of the registration results to a
   great extent. Therefore, a method for constructing a 3D custom fMRI
   template is proposed. First, the data are preprocessed; second, by
   taking a group of two-dimensional slices corresponding to the same layer
   of the brain in three-dimensional fMRI images at multiple time points as
   image sequences, each group of slice sequences are registered and fused;
   and finally, a group of fused slices corresponding to different layers
   of the brain are obtained. In the process of registration, in order to
   make full use of the correlation information between the sequence data,
   the feature points of each two slices of adjacent time points in the
   sequence are matched, and then according to the transformation
   relationship between the adjacent images, they are recursively forwarded
   and mapped to the same space. Then, the fused slices are stacked in
   order to form a three-dimensional customized fMRI template with
   individual pertinence. Finally, in the classic registration algorithm,
   the difference in the registration accuracy between using a custom fMRI
   template and different standard spaces is compared, which proves that
   using a custom template can improve the registration effect to a certain
   extent.},

Title = {Mapping typical and hypokinetic dysarthric speech production network
   using a connected speech paradigm in functional MRI},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {We developed a task paradigm whereby subjects spoke aloud while
   minimizing head motion during functional MRI (fMRI) in order to better
   understand the neural circuitry involved in motor speech disorders due
   to dysfunction of the central nervous system. To validate our overt
   continuous speech paradigm, we mapped the speech production network
   (SPN) in typical speakers (n = 19, 10 females) and speakers with
   hypokinetic dysarthria as a manifestation of Parkinson disease (HKD; n =
   21, 8 females) in fMRI. We then compared it with the SPN derived during
   overt speech production by O-15-water PET in the same group of typical
   speakers and another HKD cohort (n = 10, 2 females). The fMRI overt
   connected speech paradigm did not result in excessive motion artifacts
   and successfully identified the same brain areas demonstrated in the PET
   studies in the two cohorts. The SPN derived in fMRI demonstrated
   significant spatial overlap with the corresponding PET derived maps
   (typical speakers: r = 0.52; speakers with HKD: r = 0.43) and identified
   the components of the neural circuit of speech production belonging to
   the feedforward and feedback subsystems. The fMRI study in speakers with
   HKD identified significantly decreased activity in critical feedforward
   (bilateral dorsal premotor and motor cortices) and feedback (auditory
   and somatosensory areas) subsystems replicating previous PET study
   findings in this cohort. These results demonstrate that the overt
   connected speech paradigm is feasible during fMRI and can accurately
   localize the neural substrates of typical and disordered speech
   production. Our fMRI paradigm should prove useful for study of motor
   speech and voice disorders, including stuttering, apraxia of speech,
   dysarthria, and spasmodic dysphonia.},

Title = {Physiological significance of R-fMRI indices: Can functional metrics
   differentiate structural lesions (brain tumors)?},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) research has recently entered the
   era of ``big data{''}, however, few studies have provided a rigorous
   validation of the physiological underpinnings of R-fMRI indices.
   Although studies have reported that various neuropsychiatric disorders
   exhibit abnormalities in R-fMRI measures, these ``biomarkers{''} have
   not been validated in differentiating structural lesions (brain tumors)
   as a concept proof. We enrolled 60 patients with intracranial tumors
   located in the unilateral cranial cavity and 60 matched normal controls
   to test whether R-fMRI indices can differentiate tumors, which
   represents a prerequisite for adapting such indices as biomarkers for
   neuropsychiatric disorders. Common R-fMRI indices of tumors and their
   counterpart control regions, which were defined as the contralateral
   normal areas (for amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF),
   fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree
   centrality (DC)) and ipsilateral regions surrounding the tumors (for
   voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC)), were comprehensively
   assessed. According to robust paired t-tests with a Bonferroni
   correction, only VMHC (Fisher's r-to-z transformed) could successfully
   differentiate substantial tumors from their counterpart normal regions
   in patients. Furthermore, ALFF and DC were not able to differentiate
   tumor from normal unless Z-standardization was employed. To validate the
   lower power of the between-subject design compared to the within-subject
   design, each metric was calculated in a matched control group, and
   robust two-sample t-tests were used to compare the patient tumors and
   the normal controls at the same place. Similarly, only VMHC succeeded in
   differentiating significant differences between tumors and the sham
   tumor areas of normal controls. This study tested the premise of R-fMRI
   biomarkers for differentiating lesions, and brings a new understanding
   to physical significance of the Z-standardization.},

Abstract = {Limited detection power has been a bottleneck for subject specific
   functional MRI (fMRI) studies; however, the higher signal-to-noise ratio
   afforded by ultra-high magnetic fields (>7 Tesla) provides levels of
   sensitivity and resolution needed to study individual subjects. What may
   be surprising is that higher imaging resolution may provide both higher
   specificity and sensitivity due to reductions in partial volume effects
   and reduced physiological noise. However, challenges remain to ensure
   high data quality and to reduce variability in ultra-high field fMRI. We
   discuss session-specific biases including those caused by factors
   related to instrumentation, anatomy, and physiology-which can translate
   into variability across sessions-and how to minimize these to help
   ultra-high field fMRI reach its full potential for individual-focused

Title = {Localization of Epileptic Foci Based on Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   electroencephalography (EEG) enables a non-invasive investigation of the
   human brain function and evaluation of the correlation of these two
   important modalities of brain activity. This paper explores recent
   reports on using advanced simultaneous EEG-fMRI methods proposed to map
   the regions and networks involved in focal epileptic seizure generation.
   One of the applications of EEG and fMRI combination as a valuable
   clinical approach is the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with
   epilepsy to map and localize the precise brain regions associated with
   epileptiform activity. In the process of conventional analysis using
   EEG-fMRI data, the interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are
   visually extracted from the EEG data to be convolved as binary events
   with a predefined hemodynamic response function (HRF) to provide a model
   of epileptiform BOLD activity and use as a regressor for general linear
   model (GLM) analysis of the fMRI data. This review examines the
   methodologies involved in performing such studies, including techniques
   used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner, artifact removal, and
   statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. It then discusses the results
   reported for patients with primary generalized epilepsy and patients
   with different types of focal epileptic disorders. An important matter
   that these results have brought to light is that the brain regions
   affected by interictal epileptic discharges might not be limited to the
   ones where they have been generated. The developed methods can help
   reveal the regions involved in or affected by a seizure onset zone
   (SOZ). As confirmed by the reviewed literature, EEG-fMRI provides
   information that comes particularly useful when evaluating patients with
   refractory epilepsy for surgery.},

Title = {Noninvasive Characterization of Functional Pathways in Layer-Specific
   Microcircuits of the Human Brain Using 7T fMRI},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Layer-specific cortical microcircuits have been explored through
   invasive animal studies, yet it is not possible to reliably characterize
   them functionally and noninvasively in the human brain. However, recent
   advances in ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) have made it feasible to reasonably resolve layer-specific fMRI
   signals with sub-millimeter resolution. Here, we propose an experimental
   and analytical framework that enables the noninvasive functional
   characterization of layer-specific cortical microcircuits. Specifically,
   we illustrate this framework by characterizing layer-specific functional
   pathways in the corticogeniculate network of the human visual system by
   obtaining sub-millimeter fMRI at 7T using a task which engages the
   magnocellular pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and
   the primary visual cortex. Our results demonstrate that: (i)
   center-surround inhibition in magnocellular neurons within LGN is
   detectable using localized fMRI responses; (ii) feedforward (LGN ->
   layers VI/IV, layer IV -> layer VI) and feedback (layer VI -> LGN)
   functional pathways, known to exist from invasive animal studies, can be
   inferred using dynamic directional connectivity models of fMRI and could
   potentially explain the mechanism underlying center-surround inhibition
   as well as gain control by layer VI in the human visual system. Our
   framework is domain-neutral and could potentially be employed to
   investigate the layer-specific cortical microcircuits in other systems
   related to cognition, memory and language.},

Title = {Reliability of neural food cue-reactivity in participants with obesity

Abstract = {Obesity is highly prevalent worldwide and results in a high disease
   burden. The efforts to monitor and predict treatment outcome in
   participants with obesity using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) depends on the reliability of the investigated task-fMRI brain
   activation. To date, no study has investigated whole-brain reliability
   of neural food cue-reactivity. To close this gap, we analyzed the
   longitudinal reliability of an established food cue-reactivity task.
   Longitudinal reliability of neural food-cue-induced brain activation and
   subjective food craving ratings over three fMRI sessions (T0: 2 weeks
   before surgery, T1: 8 weeks and T2: 24 weeks after surgery) were
   investigated in N = 11 participants with obesity. We computed an array
   of established reliability estimates, including the intraclass
   correlation (ICC), the Dice and Jaccard coefficients and similarity of
   brain activation maps. The data indicated good reliability (ICC > 0.6)
   of subjective food craving ratings over 26 weeks and excellent
   reliability (ICC > 0.75) of brain activation signals for the contrast of
   interest (food > neutral) in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, middle
   cingulum, inferior, middle and superior occipital gyri, and middle and
   superior temporal gyri and cunei. Using similarity estimates, it was
   possible to re-identify individuals based on their neural activation
   maps (73\%) with a fading degree of accuracy, when comparing fMRI
   sessions further apart. The results show excellent reliability of
   task-fMRI neural brain activation in several brain regions. Current data
   suggest that fMRI-based measures might indeed be suitable to monitor and
   predict treatment outcome in participants with obesity undergoing
   bariatric surgery.},
