Language lateralization with resting-state and task-based functional MRI in pediatric epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						resting-state functional MRI; resting-state fMRI; task-based functional MRI; task-based fMRI; language lateralization; pediatric epilepsy; surgical technique	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; DOMINANCE; AREAS; FMRI	OBJECTIVE Determining language laterality in patients with intractable epilepsy is important in operative planning. Wada testing is the gold standard, but it has a risk of stroke. Both Wada and task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) require patient cooperation. Recently, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been explored for language lateralization. In the present study, the correlation between rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI in language lateralization is estimated in a pediatric population with intractable epilepsy. METHODS rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI language lateralization testing performed as part of epilepsy surgery evaluation was retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients underwent rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI; a total of 38 rs-fMRI studies and 30 tb-fMRI studies were obtained. tb-fMRI suggested left dominance in 25 of 30 cases (83%), right in 3 (10%), and in 2 (7%) the studies were nondiagnostic. In rs-fMRI, 26 of 38 studies (68%) suggested left dominance, 3 (8%) right dominance, 6 (16%) bilateral, and 3 (8%) were nondiagnostic. When tb-fMRI lateralized to the left hemisphere (25 cases), rs-fMRI was lateralized to the left in 23 patients (92%) and it was bilateral/equal in 2 (8%). When tb-fMRI lateralized to the right (3 cases), rs-fMRI lateralized to the right in all cases (100%). The overall concordance rate was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76-0.99) when considering cases with tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI performed within 6 months of each other, and tb-fMRI results were not nondiagnostic. CONCLUSIONS rs-fMRI significantly correlated with tb-fMRI in lateralizing language and suggests the potential role for identifying hemispheric dominance via rs-fMRI. Further investigation and validation studies are warranted.

Although there have been improvements in image resolution and artifact correction, there are still limitations of this modality. In this review, we discuss clinical fMRI's applications, limitations and potential solutions. These limitations depend on the following parameters: foundations of fMRI, physiologic effects of the disease, distinctions between clinical and research fMRI, and the design of the fMRI study. We also compare fMRI to other brain mapping modalities which should be considered as alternatives or adjuncts when appropriate, and discuss intraoperative use and validation of fMRI. These concepts direct the clinical application of fMRI in neurosurgical patients.

The results demonstrate that MB-SWIFT allows functional images free of susceptibility artifacts, and provides an excellent fMRI activation contrast in the brain. Flip angle dependence of the MB-SWIFT fMRI signal and elimination of the fMRI contrast while using saturation bands, indicate a blood flow origin of the observed fMRI contrast. MB-SWIFT fMRI modality permits activation studies in the close proximity to an implanted lead, which is not possible to achieve with conventionally used gradient echo and spin echo - echo planar imaging fMRI techniques. We conclude that MB-SWIFT fMRI is a powerful imaging modality for investigations of functional responses during DBS.

Here, a 2D multi-echo single-vessel fMRI (MESV-fMRI) method has been developed to map the fMRI signal from arterioles and venules with a 100ms sampling rate at multiple echo times (TE, 3-30ms) and short acquisition windows (<1ms). The T-2*-weighted signal shows the increased extravascular effect on venule voxels as a function of TE. In contrast, the arteriole voxels show an increased fMRI signal with earlier onset than venules voxels at the short TE (3ms) with increased blood inflow and volume effects. MESV-fMRI enables vessel-specific T2* mapping and presents T2*-based fMRI time courses with higher contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) than the T2*-weighted fMRI signal at a given TE. The vessel-specific T2* mapping also allows semi-quantitative estimation of the oxygen saturation levels (Y) and their changes (Delta Y) at a given blood volume fraction upon neuronal activation. The MESV-fMRI method enables vessel-specific T2* measurements with high spatiotemporal resolution for better modeling of the fMRI signal based on the hemodynamic parameters.

Thus, it is important to examine its biophysical and physiological source in order to optimize, model and accurately interpret fMRI. Animal models have been used to investigate these issues to take systematic measurements and combine with conventional invasive approaches. Here, we reviewed and discussed multiple issues, including the echo time-dependent intravascular contribution and extravascular contributions, gradient-echo vs. spin-echo fMRI, the physiological source of BOLD fMRI, arterial vs. venous cerebral blood volume change, cerebral oxygen consumption change, and arterial oxygen saturation change. We then discuss future directions of animal fMRI and translation to human fMRI. Systematic biophysical BOLD fMRI studies provide insight into the modeling and interpretation of BOLD fMRI in animals and humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Presurgical brain mapping of the language network in patients with brain tumors using resting-state fMRI: Comparison with task fMRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						resting-state fMRI; task-fMRI; language network; presurgical brain mapping; brain tumor	DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; MOTOR; REPRODUCIBILITY; LATERALIZATION; RELIABILITY; PARADIGMS; MOTION; AREAS	PurposeTo compare language networks derived from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) with task-fMRI in patients with brain tumors and investigate variables that affect rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance. Materials and MethodsIndependent component analysis (ICA) of rs-fMRI was performed with 20, 30, 40, and 50 target components (ICA20 to ICA50) and language networks identified for patients presenting for presurgical fMRI mapping between 1/1/2009 and 7/1/2015. 49 patients were analyzed fulfilling criteria for presence of brain tumors, no prior brain surgery, and adequate task-fMRI performance. Rs-vs-task-fMRI concordance was measured using Dice coefficients across varying fMRI thresholds before and after noise removal. Multi-thresholded Dice coefficient volume under the surface (DiceVUS) and maximum Dice coefficient (MaxDice) were calculated. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significance of DiceVUS and MaxDice between the four ICA order groups. Age, Sex, Handedness, Tumor Side, Tumor Size, WHO Grade, number of scrubbed volumes, image intensity root mean square (iRMS), and mean framewise displacement (FD) were used as predictors for VUS in a linear regression. ResultsArtificial elevation of rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance is seen at low thresholds due to noise. Noise-removed group-mean DiceVUS and MaxDice improved as ICA order increased, however ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the four groups. Linear regression demonstrated an association between iRMS and DiceVUS for ICA30-50, and iRMS and MaxDice for ICA50. ConclusionOverall there is moderate group level rs-vs-task fMRI language network concordance, however substantial subject-level variability exists; iRMS may be used to determine reliability of rs-fMRI derived language networks.

FMRI data analysis is extensively used in neuroimaging fields, but the tools for processing fMRI data are lacking. A novel APP DESIGNER conversion, preprocessing, and postprocessing of fMRI (CPREPP fMRI) tool is proposed and developed in this work. This toolbox is intended for pipeline fMRI data analysis, including full analysis of fMRI data, starting from DICOM conversion, then checking the quality of data at each step, and ending in postprocessing analysis. The CPREPP fMRI tool includes 12 conversions of scientific processes that reflect all conversion possibilities among them. In addition, specific preprocessing order steps are proposed on the basis of data acquisition mode (interleaved and sequential modes). A severe and crucial comparison between statistical parametric and nonparametric mapping approaches of second-level analysis is presented in the same tool. The CPREPP fMRI tool can provide reports to exclude subjects with the extreme movement of the head during the scan, and a range of fMRI images are generated to verify the normalization effect easily. Real fMRI data are used in this work to prepare fMRI data tests.

We surveyed a neuroradiology professional group to ascertain their experience with rs-fMRI, identify perceived barriers to using rs-fMRI clinically and elicit suggestions about ways to facilitate its use in clinical practice. The electronic survey also collected information about demographics and work environment using Likert scales. We found that 90% of the respondents had adequate equipment to conduct rs-fMRI and 82% found rs-fMRI data easy to collect. Fifty-nine percent have used rs-fMRI in their past research and 72% reported plans to use rs-fMRI for research in the next year. Nevertheless, only 40% plan to use rs-fMRI in clinical practice in the next year and 82% agreed that their clinical fMRI use is largely confined to pre-surgical planning applications. To explore the reasons for the persistent low utilization of rs-fMRI in clinical applications, we identified barriers to clinical rs-fMRI use related to the availability of robust denoising procedures, single-subject analysis techniques, demonstration of functional connectivity map reliability, regulatory clearance, reimbursement, and neuroradiologist training opportunities. In conclusion, while rs-fMRI use in clinical neuroradiology practice is limited, enthusiasm appears to be quite high and there are several possible avenues in which further research and development may facilitate its penetration into clinical practice.

Enhanced Thalamic Functional Connectivity with No fMRI Responses to Affected Forelimb Stimulation in Stroke-Recovered Rats	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						stroke recovery; rat; resting state fMRI; stimulus-induced fMRI; plastic reorganization	FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; MOTOR RECOVERY; BOLD FMRI; BRAIN; REORGANIZATION; VISUALIZATION; HEMODYNAMICS; MEDETOMIDINE; PREDICTION; SOFTWARE	Neurological recovery after stroke has been extensively investigated to provide better understanding of neurobiological mechanism, therapy, and patient management. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional MRI (fMRI), have widely contributed to unravel the relationship between the altered neural function and stroke-affected brain areas. As results of previous investigations, the plastic reorganization and/or gradual restoration of the hemodynamic fMRI responses to neural stimuli have been suggested as relevant mechanisms underlying the stroke recovery process. However, divergent study results and modality-dependent outcomes have clouded the proper interpretation of variable fMRI signals. Here, we performed both evoked and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to clarify the link between the fMRI phenotypes and post-stroke functional recovery. The experiments were designed to examine the altered neural activity within the contra-lesional hemisphere and other undamaged brain regions using rat models with large unilateral stroke, which despite the severe injury, exhibited nearly full recovery at similar to 6 months after stroke. Surprisingly, both blood oxygenation level-dependent and blood volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI activities elicited by electrical stimulation of the stroke-affected forelimb were completely absent, failing to reveal the neural origin of the behavioral recovery. In contrast, the functional connectivity maps showed highly robust rs-fMRI activity concentrated in the contra-lesional ventromedial nucleus of thalamus (VM). The negative finding in the stimuli-induced fMRI study using the popular rat middle cerebral artery model denotes weak association between the fMRI hemodynamic responses and neurological improvement. The results strongly caution the indiscreet interpretation of stroke-affected fMRI signals and demonstrate rs-fMRI as a complementary tool for efficiently characterizing stroke recovery.

This information is critical to designing properly powered longitudinal studies. Here we comprehensively quantified and compared the test-retest reliability and reproducibility performance of 8 commonly applied fMRI tasks, 6 rs-fMRI metrics and CBF in 30 healthy volunteers. We find large variability in test-retest reliability performance across the different tb-fMRI paradigms and rs-fMRI metrics, ranging from poor to excellent. A larger extent of activation in tb-fMRI is linked to higher between-subject reliability of the respective task suggesting that differences in the amount of activation may be used as a first reliability estimate of novel tb-fMRI paradigms. For rs-fMRI, a good reliability of local activity estimates is paralleled by poor performance of global connectivity metrics. Evaluated CBF measures provide in general a good to excellent test-reliability matching or surpassing the best performing tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI metrics. This comprehensive effort allows for direct comparisons of test-retest reliability between the evaluated MRI domains and measures to aid the design of future tb-fMRI, rs-fMRI and CBF studies.

Resting fMRI as an alternative for task-based fMRI for language lateralization in temporal lobe epilepsy patients: a study using independent component analysis	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Language lateralization; Resting fMRI; Language-fMRI; Independent component analysis	WADA TEST; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; DOMINANCE; PREDICTS; ROBUST	PurposeOur aim is to investigate whether rs-fMRI can be used as an effective technique to study language lateralization. We aim to find out the most appropriate language network among different networks identified using ICA.MethodsFifteen healthy right-handed subjects, sixteen left, and sixteen right temporal lobe epilepsy patients prospectively underwent MR scanning in 3T MRI (GE Discovery MR750w), using optimized imaging protocol. We obtained task-fMRI data using a visual-verb generation paradigm. Rs-fMRI and language-fMRI analysis were conducted using FSL software. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to estimate rs-fMRI networks. Dice coefficient was calculated to examine the similarity in activated voxels of a common language template and the rs-fMRI language networks. Laterality index (LI) was calculated from the task-based language activation and rs-fMRI language network, for a range of LI thresholds at different z scores.ResultsMeasurement of hemispheric language dominance with rs-fMRI was highly concordant with task-fMRI results. Among the evaluated z scores for a range of LI thresholds, rs-fMRI yielded a maximum accuracy of 95%, a sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 92.8% for z=2 at 0.05 LI threshold.ConclusionThe present study suggests that rs-fMRI networks obtained using ICA technique can be used as an alternative for task-fMRI language laterality. The novel aspect of the work is suggestive of optimal thresholds while applying rs-fMRI, is an important endeavor given that many patients with epilepsy have co-morbid cognitive deficits. Thus, an accurate method to determine language laterality without requiring a patient to complete the language task would be advantageous.	[Smitha, K. A.; Arun, K.

Forward models demonstrate that repetition suppression is best modelled by local neural scaling	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; FUSIFORM FACE AREA; FMRI-ADAPTATION; STIMULUS SELECTIVITY; REVEALS; BOLD; PERCEPTION; PLASTICITY; REPRESENTATIONS; MECHANISMS	Inferring neural mechanisms from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging because the fMRI signal integrates over millions of neurons. One approach is to compare computational models that map neural activity to fMRI responses, to see which best predicts fMRI data. We use this approach to compare four possible neural mechanisms of fMRI adaptation to repeated stimuli (scaling, sharpening, repulsive shifting and attractive shifting), acting across three domains (global, local and remote). Six features of fMRI repetition effects are identified, both univariate and multivariate, from two independent fMRI experiments. After searching over parameter values, only the local scaling model can simultaneously fit all data features from both experiments. Thus fMRI stimulus repetition effects are best captured by down-scaling neuronal tuning curves in proportion to the difference between the stimulus and neuronal preference. These results emphasise the importance of formal modelling for bridging neuronal and fMRI levels of investigation.

Presurgical Brain Mapping of the Ventral Somatomotor Network in Patients with Brain Tumors Using Resting-State fMRI	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; BOLD FMRI; LANGUAGE; TASK; CONNECTIVITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; STIMULATION; GLIOMAS; SLEEP	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state fMRI readily identifies the dorsal but less consistently the ventral somatomotor network. Our aim was to assess the relative utility of resting-state fMRI in the identification of the ventral somatomotor network via comparison with task-based fMRI in patients with brain tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 26 surgically naive patients referred for presurgical fMRI brain mapping who had undergone both satisfactory ventral motor activation tasks and resting-state fMRI. Following standard preprocessing for task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI, general linear model analysis of the ventral motor tasks and independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI were performed with the number of components set to 20, 30, 40, and 50. Visual overlap of task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI at different component levels was assessed and categorized as full match, partial match, or no match. Rest-versus-task-fMRI concordance was calculated with Dice coefficients across varying fMRI thresholds before and after noise removal. Multithresholded Dice coefficient volume under the surface was calculated. RESULTS: The ventral somatomotor network was identified in 81% of patients. At the subject level, better matches between resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI were seen with an increasing order of components (53% of cases for 20 components versus 73% for 50 components). Noise-removed group-mean volume under the surface improved as component numbers increased from 20 to 50, though ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant difference among the 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, the ventral somatomotor network can be identified with an increase in the probability of a better match at a higher component number. There is variable concordance of the ventral 'somatomotor network at the single-subject level between resting-state and task-based fMRI.

It offers a noninvasive method to probe the brain and uses blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes to access brain function. However, the BOLD signal only represents a small fraction of the total MR signal. System instability and various noise have a strong impact on the BOLD signal. Additionally, fMRI applies fast imaging technique to record brain cognitive process over time, requiring high temporal stability of MR scanners. Furthermore, data acquisition, image quality, processing, and statistical analysis methods also have a great effect on the results of fMRI studies. Quality assurance (QA) programs for fMRI can test the stability of MR scanners, evaluate the quality of fMRI and help to find errors during fMRI scanning, thereby greatly enhancing the success rate of fMRI. In this review, we focus on previous studies which developed QA programs and methods in SCl/SCIE citation peer-reviewed publications over the last 20 years, including topics on existing fMRI QA programs, QA phantoms, image QA metrics, quality evaluation of existing preprocessing pipelines and fMRI statistical analysis methods. The summarized studies were classified into four categories: QA of fMRI systems, QA of fMRI data, quality evaluation of data processing pipelines and statistical methods and QA of task-related fMRI. Summary tables and figures of QA programs and metrics have been developed based on the comprehensive review of the literature.

The objective of this study was to investigate their relationship in the resting-state in healthy elderly participants (n = 18). For RS-fMRI signal, regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and degree of centrality (DC) maps were generated in multiple frequency bands. Glucose uptake was acquired with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear correlation of each pair of the FDG-PET and RS-fMRI metrics was explored both in across-voxel way and in across-subject way. We found a significant across-voxel correlation between the FDG-PET and BOLD-fMRI metrics. However, only a small portion of voxels showed significant across-subject correlation between FDG-PET and BOLD-fMRI metrics. All these results were similar across all frequency bands of RS-fMRI data. The current findings indicate that FDG-PET and RS-fMRI metrics share similar spatial pattern (significant across-voxel correlation) but have different underlying physiological importance (non-significant across-subject correlation). Specifically, FDG-PET measures the mean glucose metabolism over tens of minutes, while RS-fMRI measures the dynamic characteristics. The combination of FDG-PET and RS-fMRI provides complementary information to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the brain activity and may enable more comprehensive interpretation of clinical PET-fMRI studies. Future studies would attempt to reduce the artifacts of RS-fMRI and to analyze the dynamic feature of PET signal.

Many studies reported in the literature are based on the brain activity patterns using either fMRI or EEG/MEG only. EEG and fMRI considered as two complementary neuroimaging modalities in terms of their temporal and spatial resolution to map the brain activity. For getting a high spatial and temporal resolution of the brain at the same time, simultaneous EEG-fMRI seems to be fruitful. METHODS: In this article, we propose a new method based on simultaneous EEG- fMRI data and machine learning approach to classify the visual brain activity patterns. We acquired EEG- fMRI data simultaneously on the ten healthy human participants by showing them visual stimuli. Data fusion approach is used to merge EEG and fMRI data. Machine learning classifier is used for the classification purposes. RESULTS: Results showed that superior classification performance has been achieved with simultaneous EEG- fMRI data as compared to the EEG and fMRI data standalone. This shows that multimodal approach improved the classification accuracy results as compared with other approaches reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach for classifying the brain activity patterns can be helpful to predict or fully decode the brain activity patterns.

Tracking brain arousal fluctuations with fMRI	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						resting-state fMRI; spontaneous fluctuations; arousal; electrophysiology	RESTING-STATE FMRI; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA-RHYTHM; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; SLEEP; SIGNAL; WAKEFULNESS; VIGILANCE; CORTEX	Changes in brain activity accompanying shifts in vigilance and arousal can interfere with the study of other intrinsic and task-evoked characteristics of brain function. However, the difficulty of tracking and modeling the arousal state during functional MRI (fMRI) typically precludes the assessment of arousal-dependent influences on fMRI signals. Here we combine fMRI, electrophysiology, and the monitoring of eyelid behavior to demonstrate an approach for tracking continuous variations in arousal level from fMRI data. We first characterize the spatial distribution of fMRI signal fluctuations that track a measure of behavioral arousal; taking this pattern as a template, and using the local field potential as a simultaneous and independent measure of cortical activity, we observe that the time-varying expression level of this template in fMRI data provides a close approximation of electrophysiological arousal. We discuss the potential benefit of these findings for increasing the sensitivity of fMRI as a cognitive and clinical biomarker.

An intraclass correlation coefficient analysis using data quality measures indicated a major influence of the fMRI site on variability. In accordance with this, within-site localization variability was considerably lower (about 3 mm). We conclude that the fMRI site is a considerable confound for localization of brain activity. However, when performed by experienced clinical fMRI experts, brain pathology does not seem to have a relevant impact on the reliability of fMRI localizations. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Multi-echo fMRI: A review of applications in fMRI denoising and analysis of BOLD signals	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME-SERIES; SPIN-ECHO; DIFFERENTIATING BOLD; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVATION; REMOVING MOTION; GLOBAL SIGNAL	In recent years the field of fMRI research has enjoyed expanded technical abilities related to resolution, as well as use across many fields of brain research. At the same time, the field has also dealt with uncertainty related to many known and unknown effects of artifact in fMRI data. In this review we discuss an emerging fMRI technology, called multi-echo (ME)-fMRI, which focuses on improving the fidelity and interpretability of fMRI. Where the essential problem of standard single-echo fMRI is the indeterminacy of sources of signals, whether BOLD or artifact, this is not the case for ME-fMRI. By acquiring multiple echo images per slice, the ME approach allows T-2* decay to be modeled at every voxel at every time point. Since BOLD signals arise by changes in T-2* over time, an fMRI experiment sampling the T-2* signal decay can be analyzed to distinguish BOLD from artifact signal constituents. While the ME approach has a long history of use in theoretical and validation studies, modern MRI systems enable whole-brain multi-echo fMRI at high resolution. This review covers recent multi-echo fMRI acquisition methods, and the analysis steps for this data to make fMRI at once more principled, straightforward, and powerful. After a brief overview of history and theory, T-2* modeling and applications will be discussed. These applications include T-2* mapping and combining echoes from ME data to increase BOLD contrast and mitigate dropout artifacts. Next, the modeling of fMRI signal changes to detect signal origins in BOLD-related T-2* versus artifact-related So changes will be reviewed. A focus is on the use of ME-fMRI data to extract and classify components from spatial ICA, called multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA). After describing how ME-fMRI and ME-ICA lead to a general model for analysis of fMRI signals, applications in animal and human imaging will be discussed. Applications include removing motion artifacts in resting state data at subject and group level. New imaging methods such as multi-band multi-echo fMRI and imaging at 7 T are demonstrated throughout the review, and a practical analysis pipeline is described. The review culminates with evidence from recent studies of major boosts in statistical power from using multi-echo fMRI for detecting activation and connectivity in healthy individuals and patients with neuropsychiatric disease. In conclusion, the review shows evidence that the multi-echo approach expands the range of experiments that is practicable using fMRI. These findings suggest a compelling future role of the multi-echo approach in subject-level and clinical fMRI.

Resting-State Seed-Based Analysis: An Alternative to Task-Based Language fMRI and Its Laterality Index	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MRI; FLUCTUATIONS; ACTIVATION; AMPLITUDE; PREDICTS; TOOLBOX	Eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers were prospectively evaluated with resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI to assess language networks. The laterality indices of Broca and Wernicke areas were calculated by using task-based fMRI via a voxel-value approach. The authors performed seed-based resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis together with parameters such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). fALFF can be used as an alternative to task-based fMRI for assessing language laterality. There was a strong positive correlation between the fALFF of the Broca area of resting-state fMRI with the laterality index of task-based fMRI. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Language is a cardinal function that makes human unique. Preservation of language function poses a great challenge for surgeons during resection. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of resting-state fMRI in the lateralization of language function in healthy subjects to permit its further testing in patients who are unable to perform task-based fMRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers were prospectively evaluated with resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI to assess language networks. The laterality indices of Broca and Wernicke areas were calculated by using task-based fMRI via a voxel-value approach. We adopted seed-based resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis together with parameters such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). Resting-state fMRI connectivity maps for language networks were obtained from Broca and Wernicke areas in both hemispheres. We performed correlation analysis between the laterality index and the z scores of functional connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, and fALFF. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis between signals obtained from the z score of fALFF and the laterality index yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.849 (P < .05). Regression analysis of the fALFF with the laterality index yielded an R-2 value of 0.721, indicating that 72.1% of the variance in the laterality index of task-based fMRI could be predicted from the fALFF of resting-state fMRI. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that fALFF can be used as an alternative to task-based fMRI for assessing language laterality. There was a strong positive correlation between the fALFF of the Broca area of resting-state fMRI with the laterality index of task-based fMRI. Furthermore, we demonstrated the efficacy of fALFF for predicting the laterality of task-based fMRI.	[Smitha, K. A.; Arun, K.

Here we provide the first comprehensive review of the fMRI-nf literature and the first systematic database of fMRI-nf findings. We synthesize information from 99 fMRI-nf experiments-the bulk of currently available data. The vast majority of fMRI-nf findings suggest that self-regulation of specific brain signatures seems viable; however, replication of concomitant behavioral outcomes remains sparse. To disentangle placebo influences and establish the specific effects of neurofeedback, we highlight the need for double-blind placebo-controlled studies alongside rigorous and standardized statistical analyses. Before fMRI-nf can join the clinical armamentarium, research must first confirm the sustainability, transferability, and feasibility of fMRI-nf in patients as well as in healthy individuals. Whereas modulating specific brain activity promises to mold cognition, emotion, thought, and action, reducing complex mental health issues to circumscribed brain regions may represent a tenuous goal. We can certainly change brain activity with fMRI-nf. However, it remains unclear whether such changes translate into meaningful behavioral improvements in the clinical domain.

Impact of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging on Clinical Outcomes in a Propensity-Matched Low Grade Glioma Cohort	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Brain tumors; fMRI; Low grade glioma	DOMINANT HEMISPHERE; RESECTION; SURVIVAL; LANGUAGE; AREAS; FMRI; LOCALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; GROWTH	BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the impact of preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on clinical outcomes in patients with low grade glioma (LGG). METHODS: In a retrospective propensity-matched cohort study, we compared patients with LGG based on whether they underwent fMRI as part of preoperative assessment. Twelve patients with LGG who underwent preoperative fMRI were selected, and a contemporaneous group of 12 control patients with LGG who did not undergo fMRI were matched to the fMRI group based on age, sex, and 1p/19q status. RESULTS: fMRI group subjects tended to have more aggressive surgeries (67% resection, 33% biopsy) than the control group (33% resection, 67% biopsy). There were no significant differences in outcomes between the 2 groups. Time between clinical assessment and surgery tended to be longer in the fMRI group (6.3 +/- 4.2 weeks) than in the control group (2.7 +/- 2.2 weeks). Extent of resection was similar between the 2 cohorts. fMRI group subjects had lower preoperative functional status and tended to have a greater postoperative functional status improvement than control group subjects. Mean survival was not significantly different (fMRI group 5-year survival: 88.9%, control group 5-year survival: 61.1%). CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the impact of preoperative fMRI in patients with LGG in this propensity-matched cohort study. This study has not demonstrated any significant difference in outcomes between the fMRI and control groups; however, there were nonsignificant trends for patients who underwent fMRI to undergo more aggressive surgical interventions and have a greater postoperative functional status improvement.

Method for spatial overlap estimation of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; ERP; Joint independent component analysis (jICA); Auditory; Oddball; P300	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; ERP; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM	Background. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements may represent activity from partially divergent neural sources, but this factor is seldom modeled in fMRI-EEG data integration. New method. This paper proposes an approach to estimate the spatial overlap between sources of activity measured simultaneously with fMRI and EEG. Following the extraction of task-related activity, the key steps include, 1) distributed source reconstruction of the task-related ERP activity (ERP source model), 2) transformation of fMRI activity to the ERP spatial scale by forward modelling of the scalp potential field distribution and backward source reconstruction (fMRI source simulation), and 3) optimization of fMRI and ERP thresholds to maximize spatial overlap without a priori constraints of coupling (overlap calculation). Results: FMRI and ERP responses were recorded simultaneously in 15 subjects performing an auditory oddball task. A high degree of spatial overlap between sources of fMRI and ERP responses (in 9 or more of 15 subjects) was found specifically within temporoparietal areas associated with the task. Areas of non-overlap in fMRI and ERP sources were relatively small and inconsistent across subjects. Comparison with existing method: The ERP and fMRI sources estimated with solely jICA overlapped in just 4 of 15 subjects, and strictly in the parietal cortex. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the new fMRI-ERP spatial overlap estimation method provides greater spatiotemporal detail of the cortical dynamics than solely jICA. As such, we propose that it is a superior method for the integration of fMRI and EEG to study brain function.	[Heugel, N.; Liebenthal, E.; Beardsley, S.

However, the accuracy of fMRI-constrained EEG/MEG source imaging may be degraded by potential spatial mismatches between the locations of fMRI activation and electrical source activities. To address this problem, we propose a novel fMRI informed time-variant constraint (FITC) method. The weights in FITC are determined by combining the fMRI activities and electrical source activities in a time-variant manner to reduce the impact of the fMRI extra sources. The fMRI weights are modified using cross-talk matrix and normalized partial area under the curve to reduce the impact of fMRI missing sources. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare the source estimates produced by L2-minimum norm estimation (MNE), fMRI-weighted minimum norm estimation (fMNE), FITC, and depth-weighted FITC (wFITC) algorithms with various spatial mismatch conditions. Localization error and temporal correlation were calculated to compare the four algorithms under different conditions. The simulation results indicated that the FITC and wFITC methods were more robust than the MNE and fMNE algorithms. Moreover, FITC and wFITC were significantly better than fMNE under the fMRI missing sources condition. A human visual-stimulus EEG, MEG, and fMRI test was performed, and the experimental data revealed that FITC and wFITC displayed more focal areas than fMNE and MNE. In conclusion, the proposed FITC method is able to better resolve the spatial mismatch problems encountered in fMRI-constrained EEG/MEG source imaging.

Neurofeedback approaches usually rely on a single brain imaging modality such as EEG or fMRI. Combining these modalities for neurofeedback training could allow to provide richer information to the subject and could thus enable him/her to achieve faster and more specific self-regulation. Yet unimodal and multimodal neurofeedback have never been compared before. In the present work, we introduce a simultaneous EEG-fMRI experimental protocol in which participants performed a motor-imagery task in unimodal and bimodal NF conditions. With this protocol we were able to compare for the first time the effects of unimodal EEG-neurofeedback and fMRI-neurofeedback versus bimodal EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback by looking both at EEG and fMRI activations. We also propose a new feedback metaphor for bimodal EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback that integrates both EEG and fMRI signal in a single bi-dimensional feedback (a ball moving in 2D). Such a feedback is intended to relieve the cognitive load of the subject by presenting the bimodal neurofeedback task as a single regulation task instead of two. Additionally, this integrated feedback metaphor gives flexibility on defining a bimodal neurofeedback target. Participants were able to regulate activity in their motor regions in all NF conditions. Moreover, motor activations as revealed by offline fMRI analysis were stronger during EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback than during EEG-neurofeedback. This result suggests that EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback could be more specific or more engaging than EEG-neurofeedback. Our results also suggest that during EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback, participants tended to regulate more the modality that was harder to control. Taken together our results shed first light on the specific mechanisms of bimodal EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback and on its added-value as compared to unimodal EEG-neurofeedback and fMRI-neurofeedback.

However, recent findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting fMRI activity at higher frequencies beyond 0.2 Hz. The origin, reliability, and generalizability of fast fMRI responses are still under debate and await confirmation through animal experiments with fMRI and invasive electrophysiology. Here, we acquired single-echo and multi-echo fMRI, as well as local field potentials, from anesthetized rat brains given gastric electrical stimulation modulated at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 Hz. Such gastric stimuli could drive widespread fMRI responses at corresponding frequencies from the somatosensory and cingulate cortices. Such fast fMRI responses were linearly dependent on echo times and thus indicative of blood oxygenation level dependent nature (BOLD). Local field potentials recorded during the same gastric stimuli revealed transient and phase-locked broadband neural responses, preceding the fMRI responses by as short as 0.5 s. Taken together, these results suggest that gastric stimulation can drive widespread and rapid fMRI responses of BOLD and neural origin, lending support to the feasibility of using fMRI to detect rapid changes in neural activity up to 0.8 Hz under visceral stimulation.

There is a shift in focus toward progressive changes throughout stress paradigms and individual susceptibility to stress that requires methods that allow for longitudinal study design and study of individual differences in stress response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with the advantages of noninvasiveness and a large field of view, can be used for functionally mapping brain-wide regions and circuits critical to the stress response, making it suitable for longitudinal studies and understanding individual variability of short-term and long-term consequences of stress exposure. In addition, fMRI can be applied to both animals and humans, which is highly valuable in translating findings across species and examining whether the physiology and neural circuits involved in the stress response are conserved in mammals. However, compared to human fMRI studies, there are a number of factors that are essential for the success of fMRI studies in animals. This review discussed the use of fMRI in animal studies of stress. It reviewed advantages, challenges and technical considerations of the animal fMRI methodology as well as recent literature of stress studies using fMRI in animals. It also highlighted the development of combining fMRI with other methods and the future potential of fMRI in animal studies of stress. We conclude that animal fMRI studies, with their flexibility, low cost and short time frame compared to human studies, are crucial to advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of stress.

J	Schrooten, M; Vandenberghe, R; Peeters, R; Dupont, P				Schrooten, Maarten; Vandenberghe, Rik; Peeters, Ronald; Dupont, Patrick			Quantitative Analyses Help in Choosing Between Simultaneous vs. Separate EEG and fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						simultaneous; EEG-fMRI; quality; artifacts; TSNR; FFT; spectrogram	ARTIFACT CORRECTION; 7 T; QUALITY; NOISE; SIGNAL; CAP; MRI	Simultaneous registration of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is considered an attractive approach for studying brain function non-invasively. It combines the better spatial resolution of fMRI with the better temporal resolution of EEG, but comes at the cost of increased measurement artifact and the accompanying artifact preprocessing. This paper presents a study of the residual signal quality based on temporal signal to noise ratio (TSNR) for fMRI and fast Fourier transform (FFT) for EEG, after optimized conventional signal preprocessing. Measurements outside the magnetic resonance imaging scanner and inside the scanner prior to and during image acquisition were compared. For EEG, frequency and region dependent significant effects on FFT squared amplitudes were observed between separately vs. simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI, with larger effects during image acquisition than without image acquisition inside the scanner bore. A graphical user interface was developed to aid in quality checking these measurements. For fMRI, separately recorded EEG-fMRI revealed relatively large areas with a significantly higher TSNR in right occipital and parietal regions and in the cingulum, compared to separately recorded EEG-fMRI. Simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI showed significantly higher TSNR in inferior occipital cortex, diencephalon and brainstem, compared to separately recorded EEG-fMRI. Quantification of EEG and fMRI signals showed significant, but sometimes subtle, changes between separate compared to simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements. To avoid interference with the experiment of interest in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurement, it seems warranted to perform a quantitative evaluation to ensure that there are no such uncorrectable effects present in regions or frequencies that are of special interest to the research question at hand.

However, the lack of clinically streamlined and reliable rs-fMRI analysis tools has prevented wide adoption of this technique. In this work, the authors introduce an rs-fMRI processing pipeline (ReStNeuMap) for automatic single-patient rs-fMRI network analysis. METHODS The authors provide a description of the rs-fMRI network analysis steps implemented in ReStNeuMap and report their initial experience with this tool after performing presurgical mapping in 6 patients. They verified the spatial agreement between rs-fMRI networks derived by ReStNeuMap and localization of activation with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES). RESULTS The authors automatically extracted rs-fMRI networks including eloquent cortex in spatial proximity with the resected lesion in all patients. The distance between DES points and corresponding rs-fMRI networks was less than 1 cm in 78% of cases for motor, 100% of cases for visual, 87.5% of cases for language, and 100% of cases for speech articulation mapping. CONCLUSIONS The authors' initial experience with ReStNeuMap showed good spatial agreement between presurgical rs-fMRI predictions and DES findings during awake surgery. The availability of the rs-fMRI analysis tools for clinicians aiming to perform noninvasive mapping of brain functional networks may extend its application beyond surgical practice.

These locations can be clinically used as stimulation target of TMS treatment. However, it has been reported that the finger tapping fMRI activation and TMS hotspot were not well-overlapped. The aim of the current study was to measure the distance between the finger tapping fMRI activation and the TMS hotspot, and more importantly, to compare the network difference by using resting-state fMRI. Thirty healthy participants underwent resting-state fMRI, task fMRI, and then TMS hotspot localization. We found significant difference of locations between finger tapping fMRI activation and TMS hotspot. Specifically, the finger tapping fMRI activation was more lateral than the TMS hotspot in the premotor area. The fMRI activation peak and TMS hotspot were taken as seeds for resting-state functional connectivity analyses. Compared with TMS hotspot, finger tapping fMRI activation peak showed more intensive functional connectivity with, e.g., the bilateral premotor, insula, putamen, and right globus pallidus. The findings more intensive networks of finger tapping activation than TMS hotspot suggest that TMS treatment targeting on the fMRI activation area might result in more remote effects and would be more helpful for TMS treatment on movement disorders.

Neural activity under cognitive reappraisal can be more accurately investigated using simultaneous EEG-(electroencephalography) fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) than using EEG or fMRI only. Complementary spatiotemporal information can be found from simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to study brain function. Method. An effective EEG-fMRI fusion framework is proposed in this work. EEG-fMRI data is simultaneously sampled on fifteen visually stimulated healthy adult participants. Net-station toolbox and empirical mode decomposition are employed for EEG denoising. Sparse spectral clustering is used to construct fMRI masks that are used to constrain fMRI activated regions. A kernel-based canonical correlation analysis is utilized to fuse nonlinear EEG-fMRI data. Results. The experimental results show a distinct late positive potential (LPP, latency 200-700 ms) from the correlated EEG components that are reconstructed from nonlinear EEG-fMRI data. Peak value of LPP under reappraisal state is smaller than that under negative state, however, larger than that under neutral state. For correlated fMRI components, obvious activation can be observed in cerebral regions, e.g., the amygdala, temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and frontal lobe. Meanwhile, in these regions, activated intensity under reappraisal state is obviously smaller than that under negative state and larger than that under neutral state. Conclusions. The proposed EEG-fMRI fusion approach provides an effective way to study the neural activities of cognitive reappraisal with high spatiotemporal resolution. It is also suitable for other neuroimaging technologies using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data.

Technical Note: Independent component analysis for quality assurance in functional MRI	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						independent component analysis; quality control; functional magnetic resonance imaging	FMRI TIME-SERIES; MOTION ARTIFACTS; ICA; CLASSIFICATION; MULTICENTER; CLASSIFIERS; BRAIN	Purpose: Independent component analysis (ICA) is an established method of analyzing human functional MRI (fMRI) data. Here, an ICA-based fMRI quality control (QC) tool was developed and used. Methods: ICA-based fMRI QC tool to be used with a commercial phantom was developed. In an attempt to assess the performance of the tool relative to preexisting alternative tools, it was used seven weeks before and eight weeks after repair of a faulty gradient amplifier of a non-state-of-the-art MRI unit. More specifically, its performance was compared with the AAPM 100 acceptance testing and quality assurance protocol and two fMRI QC protocols, proposed by Freidman et al. ["Report on a multicenter fMRI quality assurance protocol," J. Magn. Reson Imaging 23, 827-839 (2006)] and Stocker et al. ["Automated quality assurance routines for fMRI data applied to a multicenter study," Hum. Brain Mapp. 25, 237-246 (2005)], respectively. Results: The easily developed and applied ICA-based QC protocol provided fMRI QC indices and maps equally sensitive to fMRI instabilities with the indices and maps of other established protocols. The ICA fMRI QC indices were highly correlated with indices of other fMRI QC protocols and in some cases theoretically related to them. Three or four independent components with slow varying time series are detected under normal conditions. Conclusions: ICA applied on phantom measurements is an easy and efficient tool for fMRI QC. Additionally, it can protect against misinterpretations of artifact components as human brain activations. Evaluating fMRI QC indices in the central region of a phantom is not always the optimal choice. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Test-retest reliability of longitudinal task-based fMRI: Implications for developmental studies	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						fMRI; Test-retest reliability; Intraclass correlation; Development	ADOLESCENT RISK-TAKING; INHIBITORY CONTROL; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ATTENTION BIAS; WORKING-MEMORY; ACTIVATION; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; AGE	Great advances have been made in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies, including the use of longitudinal design to more accurately identify changes in brain development across childhood and adolescence. While longitudinal fMRI studies are necessary for our understanding of typical and atypical patterns of brain development, the variability observed in fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal and its test-retest reliability in developing populations remain a concern. Here we review the current state of test-retest reliability for child and adolescent fMRI studies (ages 5-18 years) as indexed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). In addition to highlighting ways to improve fMRI test-retest reliability in developmental cognitive neuroscience research, we hope to open a platform for dialogue regarding longitudinal fMRI study designs, analyses, and reporting of results.

Task-based fMRI studies the BOLD signal increase in brain areas during a language task to identify brain language areas, which requires patients' cooperation, whereas resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) allows identification of functional networks without performing any explicit task through the analysis of the synchronicity of spontaneous BOLD signal oscillation between brain areas. The aim of this study was to compare preoperative language mapping using rsfMRI and task fMRI to cortical mapping (CM) during awake craniotomies. Methods Fifty adult patients surgically treated for a brain lesion were enrolled. All patients had a presurgical language mapping with both task fMRI and rsfMRI. Identified language networks were compared to perioperative language mapping using electric cortical stimulation. Results Resting-state fMRI was able to detect brain language areas during CM with a sensitivity of 100% compared to 65.6% with task fMRI. However, we were not able to perform a specificity analysis and compare task-based and rest fMRI with our perioperative setting in the current study. In second-order analysis, task fMRI imaging included main nodes of the SN and main areas involved in semantics were identified in rsfMRI. Conclusion Resting-state fMRI for presurgical language mapping is easy to implement, allowing the identification of functional brain language network with a greater sensitivity than task-based fMRI, at the cost of some precautions and a lower specificity. Further study is required to compare both the sensitivity and the specificity of the two methods and to evaluate the clinical value of rsfMRI as an alternative tool for the presurgical identification of brain language areas.

The seed-based analysis is a practical approach for detecting rs-FMRI functional networks; however, seed localization remains challenging for presurgical language mapping. Therefore, we proposed a data-driven approach to guide seed localization for presurgical rs-FMRI language mapping. Methods Twenty-six patients with brain tumors located in left perisylvian regions had undergone task-based FMRI and rs-FMRI before tumor resection. For the seed-based rs-FMRI language mapping, a seeding approach that integrates regional homogeneity and meta-analysis maps (RH+MA) was proposed to guide the seed localization. Canonical and task-based seeding approaches were used for comparison. The performance of the 3 seeding approaches was evaluated by calculating the Dice coefficients between each rs-FMRI language mapping result and the result from task-based FMRI. Results With the RH+MA approach, selecting among the top 6 seed candidates resulted in the highest Dice coefficient for 81% of patients (21 of 26) and the top 9 seed candidates for 92% of patients (24 of 26). The RH+MA approach yielded rs-FMRI language mapping results that were in greater agreement with the results of task-based FMRI, with significantly higher Dice coefficients (P < .05) than that of canonical and task-based approaches within putative language regions. Conclusion The proposed RH+MA approach outperformed the canonical and task-based seed localization for rs-FMRI language mapping. The results suggest that RH+MA is a robust and feasible method for seed-based functional connectivity mapping in clinical practice.

However, data interpretation can be improved, especially in regions with absent BOLD-fMRI signal activation. Absent BOLD-fMRI signal activation may actually represent false-negative activation due to impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) of the vascular bed. The relationship between impaired BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI signal activation may be better studied in healthy subjects where neurovascular coupling is known to be intact. Using a model-based prospective end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) targeting algorithm, we performed two controlled 3 tesla BOLD-CVR studies on 17 healthy subjects: 1: at the subjects' individual resting end-tidal CO2 baseline. 2: Around +6.0 mmHg CO2 above the subjects' individual resting baseline. Two BOLD-fMRI finger-tapping experiments were performed at similar normo- and hypercapnic levels. Relative BOLD fMRI signal activation and t-values were calculated for BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI data. For each component of the cerebral motor-network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, cerebellum and Pronto-operculum), the correlation between BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI signal changes and t-values was investigated. Finally, a voxelwise quantitative analysis of the impact of BOLD-CVR on BOLD-fMRI was performed. For the motor-network, the linear correlation coefficient between BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI t-values were significant (p<0.01) and in the range 0.33-0.55, similar to the correlations between the CVR and fMRI Delta%signal (p<0.05; range 0.34-0.60). The linear relationship between CVR and fMRI is challenged by our voxel-wise analysis of Delta%signal and t-value change between normo- and hypercapnia. Our main finding is that BOLD fMRI signal activation maps are markedly dampened in the presence of impaired BOLD-CVR and highlights the importance of a complementary BOLD-CVR assessment in addition to a task-evoked BOLD fMRI to identify brain areas at risk for false-negative BOLD-fMRI signal activation.

However, most of our knowledge regarding brain plasticity and repair in MS as evidenced by fMRI has been extrapolated from cross-sectional studies across different phenotypes of the disease. This topical review provides an overview of this research, but also highlights limitations of existing fMRI studies with cross-sectional design. We then review the few existing longitudinal fMRI studies and discuss the feasibility and constraints of serial fMRI in individuals with MS. We further emphasize the potential to track fMRI changes in evolving disease and the insights this may give in terms of mechanisms of adaptation and repair, focusing on serial fMRI to monitor response to disease-modifying therapies or rehabilitation interventions. Finally, we offer recommendations for designing future research studies to overcome previous methodological shortcomings.

Although some studies have succeeded in fMRI in awake mice by attaching a head-post on the skull, this cannot be applied to fMRI using a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cryogenic MRI-detector, CryoProbe, because it covers the head of a mouse closely. New method: We developed head-fixation implements for awake mice that are applicable to fMRI using CryoProbe. Results: A head-bar was surgically attached to the skull of a mouse that was then habituated to a mock fMRI-environment, two hours/day for eight days with physiological examinations of body-weight, fecal weight, electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram. EMG power decreased with just one day of habituation, whereas heart rate decreased after at least seven days of habituation. Estimated head motions of awake mice during fMRI were significantly smaller than a voxel size. Unexpectedly, temporal SNR of fMRI signals for awake mice was higher than that for anesthetized mice held by a conventional method. Functional connectivity in the brain of both anesthetized and awake mice showed bilateral and unilateral networks. Comparison with existing method(s):fMRI using CryoProbe had been performed on anesthetized mice previously. Our method does not use anesthetics during habituation or fMRI. Conclusion: Our method would be beneficial for translational research using fMRI in mice and humans because human fMRI is typically performed without anesthetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, even though the down sampled and smoothed envelope of EEG gamma band power is correlated with fMRI fluctuations in the RSNs, it does not mean that the electrical substrates of the RSNs fluctuate with periods <100 ms. Based on the scale free properties of EEG microstates and their correlation with resting state fMRI fluctuations in the RSNs, researchers have speculated that truly high frequency electrical substrates may exist for the RSNs, which would make resting fluctuations obtained from fMRI more meaningful to typically occurring fast neuronal processes in the sub -100 ms time scale. In this study, we test this critical hypothesis using an integrated framework involving simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition, fast fMRI sampling (TR = 200 ms) using multiband EPI (MB EPI), and EEG/fMRI fusion using parallel independent component analysis (pICA) which does not require the down sampling of EEG to fMRI temporal resolution. Our results demonstrate that with faster sampling, high frequency electrical substrates (fluctuating with periods < 100 ms time scale) of the RSNs can be observed. This provides a sounder neurophysiological basis for the RSNs.

Combined Electroencephalography-Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Electrical Source Imaging Improves Localization of Pediatric Focal Epilepsy	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; FMRI; NETWORKS; BRAIN; CONCORDANCE; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; SEIZURES; SURGERY	Objective: Surgical treatment in epilepsy is effective if the epileptogenic zone (EZ) can be correctly localized and characterized. Here we use simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data to derive EEG-fMRI and electrical source imaging (ESI) maps. Their yield and their individual and combined ability to (1) localize the EZ and (2) predict seizure outcome were then evaluated. Methods: Fifty-three children with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent EEG-fMRI. Interictal discharges were mapped using both EEG-fMRI hemodynamic responses and ESI. A single localization was derived from each individual test (EEG-fMRI global maxima [GM]/ESI maximum) and from the combination of both maps (EEG-fMRI/ESI spatial intersection). To determine the localization accuracy and its predictive performance, the individual and combined test localizations were compared to the presumed EZ and to the postsurgical outcome. Results: Fifty-two of 53 patients had significant maps: 47 of 53 for EEG-fMRI, 44 of 53 for ESI, and 34 of 53 for both. The EZ was well characterized in 29 patients; 26 had an EEG-fMRI GM localization that was correct in 11, 22 patients had ESI localization that was correct in 17, and 12 patients had combined EEG-fMRI and ESI that was correct in 11. Seizure outcome following resection was correctly predicted by EEG-fMRI GM in 8 of 20 patients, and by the ESI maximum in 13 of 16. The combined EEG-fMRI/ESI region entirely predicted outcome in 9 of 9 patients, including 3 with no lesion visible on MRI. Interpretation: EEG-fMRI combined with ESI provides a simple unbiased localization that may predict surgery better than each individual test, including in MRI-negative patients.

We investigated the performances of rs-fMRI and sMRI in single modality and multi-modality approaches for classifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress to probable AD-MCI converter (MCI-C) from those with MCI who do not progress to probable AD-MCI non-converter (MCI-NC). The cortical and subcortical measurements, e.g. cortical thickness, extracted from sMRI and graph measures extracted from rs-fMRI functional connectivity were used as features in our algorithm. We trained and tested a support vector machine to classify MCI-C from MCI-NC using rs-fMRI and sMRI features. Our algorithm for classifying MCI-C and MCI-NC utilized a small number of optimal features and achieved accuracies of 89% for sMRI, 93% for rs-fMRI, and 97% for the combination of sMRI with rs-fMRI. To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated integration of rs-fMRI and sMRI for identification of the early stage of AD. Our findings shed light on integration of sMRI with rs-fMRI for identification of the early stages of AD.

Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings performed simultaneously with fMRI provide high-temporal-resolution information about ongoing brain activity as well as head movements. Recently, an EEG-assisted retrospective motion correction (E-REMCOR) method was introduced. E-REMCOR utilizes EEG motion artifacts to correct the effects of head movements in simultaneously acquired fMRI data on a slice-by-slice basis. While E-REMCOR is an efficient motion correction approach, it involves an independent component analysis (ICA) of the EEG data and identification of motion-related ICs. Here we report an automated implementation of E-REMCOR, referred to as aE-REMCOR, which we developed to facilitate the application of E-REMCOR in large-scale EEG-fMRI studies. The aE-REMCOR algorithm, implemented in MATLAB, enables an automated preprocessing of the EEG data, an ICA decomposition, and, importantly, an automatic identification of motion-related ICs. aE-REMCOR has been used to perform retrospective motion correction for 305 fMRI datasets from 16 subjects, who participated in EEG-fMRI experiments conducted on a 3 TMRI scanner. Performance of aE-REMCOR has been evaluated based on improvement in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of the fMRI data, as well as correction efficiency defined in terms of spike reduction in fMRI motion parameters. The results show that aE-REMCOR is capable of substantially reducing head motion artifacts in fMRI data. In particular, when there are significant rapid head movements during the scan, a large TSNR improvement and high correction efficiency can be achieved. Depending on a subject's motion, an average TSNR improvement over the brain upon the application of aE-REMCOR can be as high as 27%, with top ten percent of the TSNR improvement values exceeding 55%. The average correction efficiency over the 305 fMRI scans is 18% and the largest achieved efficiency is 71%. The utility of aE-REMCOR on the resting state fMRI connectivity of the default mode network is also examined. The motion-induced position-dependent error in the DMN connectivity analysis is shown to be reduced when aE-REMCOR is utilized. These results demonstrate that aE-REMCOR can be conveniently and efficiently used to improve fMRI motion correction in large clinical EEG-fMRI studies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

One important, but unanswered, question is how these two types of measurements might be related with respect to the VTC. Here we examined which components of the ECoG signal correspond to the fMRI response by using a rare opportunity to measure both fMRI and ECoG responses from the same individuals to images of exemplars of various categories including faces, limbs, cars and houses. Our data reveal three key findings. First, we discovered that the coupling between fMRI and ECoG responses is frequency and time dependent. The strongest and most sustained correlation is observed between fMRI and high frequency broadband (HFB) ECoG responses (30-160 hz). In contrast, the correlation between fMRI and ECoG signals in lower frequency bands is temporally transient, where the correlation is initially positive, but then tapers off or becomes negative. Second, we find that the strong and positive correlation between fMRI and ECoG signals in all frequency bands emerges rapidly around 100 ms after stimulus onset, together with the onset of the first stimulus-driven neural signals in VTC. Third, we find that the spatial topology and representational structure of category-selectivity in VTC reflected in ECoG HFB responses mirrors the topology and structure observed with fMRI. These findings of a strong and rapid coupling between fMRI and HFB responses validate fMRI measurements of functional selectivity with recordings of direct neural activity and suggest that fMRI category-selective signals in VTC are associated with feed-forward neural processing.

However, this opportunity has not been fully explored yet due to the lack of effective and efficient tools for handling such fMRI big data. One major challenge is that computing capabilities still lag behind the growth of large-scale fMRI databases, e.g., it takes many days to perform dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole-brain fMRI data for an fMRI database of average size. Therefore, how to reduce the data size but without losing important information becomes a more and more pressing issue. To address this problem, we propose a signal sampling approach for significant fMRI data reduction before performing structurally-guided dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole brain's fMRI data. We compared the proposed structurally guided sampling method with no sampling, random sampling and uniform sampling schemes, and experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve more than 15 times speed-up without sacrificing the accuracy in identifying task-evoked functional brain networks.

Presurgical language fMRI: Clinical practices and patient outcomes in epilepsy surgical planning	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						epilepsy; fMRI; language; presurgical	SURGERY; SPEECH; LATERALIZATION; WERNICKE; SYSTEMS; AREAS	The goal of this study was to document current clinical practice and report patient outcomes in presurgical language functional MRI (fMRI) for epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgical programs worldwide were surveyed as to the utility, implementation, and efficacy of language fMRI in the clinic; 82 programs responded. Respondents were predominantly US (61%) academic programs (85%), and evaluated adults (44%), adults and children (40%), or children only (16%). Nearly all (96%) reported using language fMRI. Surprisingly, fMRI is used to guide surgical margins (44% of programs) as well as lateralize language (100%). Sites using fMRI for localization most often use a distance margin around activation of 10mm. While considered useful, 56% of programs reported at least one instance of disagreement with other measures. Direct brain stimulation typically confirmed fMRI findings (74%) when guiding margins, but instances of unpredicted decline were reported by 17% of programs and 54% reported unexpected preservation of function. Programs reporting unexpected decline did not clearly differ from those which did not. Clinicians using fMRI to guide surgical margins do not typically map known language-critical areas beyond Broca's and Wernicke's. This initial data shows many clinical teams are confident using fMRI not only for language lateralization but also to guide surgical margins. Reported cases of unexpected language preservation when fMRI activation is resected, and cases of language decline when it is not, emphasize a critical need for further validation. Comprehensive studies comparing commonly-used fMRI paradigms to predict stimulation mapping and post-surgical language decline remain of high importance.	[Benjamin, Christopher F.

Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in motor neurorehabilitation	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						neurological recovery; neuroplasticity; Parkinson's disease; real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging; stroke	PREMOTOR CORTEX ACTIVITY; FMRI NEUROFEEDBACK; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HUMAN BRAIN; SELF-REGULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; STROKE REHABILITATION; LEARNED REGULATION; AMYGDALA RESPONSE; IMAGERY	Purpose of review Recent developments in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have catalyzed a new field of translational neuroscience. Using fMRI to monitor the aspects of task-related changes in neural activation or brain connectivity, investigators can offer feedback of simple or complex neural signals/patterns back to the participant on a quasireal-time basis [real-time-fMRI-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF)]. Here, we introduce some background methodology of the new developments in this field and give a perspective on how they may be used in neurorehabilitation in the future. Recent findings The development of rt-fMRI-NF has been used to promote self-regulation of activity in several brain regions and networks. In addition, and unlike other noninvasive techniques, rt-fMRI-NF can access specific subcortical regions and in principle any region that can be monitored using fMRI including the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. In Parkinson's disease and stroke, rt-fMRI-NF has been demonstrated to alter neural activity after the self-regulation training was completed and to modify specific behaviours. Summary Future exploitation of rt-fMRI-NF could be used to induce neuroplasticity in brain networks that are involved in certain neurological conditions. However, currently, the use of rt-fMRI-NF in randomized, controlled clinical trials is in its infancy.	[Linden, David E.

Language Mapping Using T2-Prepared BOLD Functional MRI in the Presence of Large Susceptibility Artifacts-Initial Results in Patients With Brain Tumor and Epilepsy	TOMOGRAPHY			English	Article						presurgical; implant; hemorrhage; dropout; distortion	TEMPORAL-LOBE; GRADIENT-ECHO; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; DENTAL MATERIALS; CLINICAL FMRI; 1.5 T; CORTEX; DOMINANCE; TESLA; PET	At present, presurgical functional mapping is the most prevalent clinical application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Signal dropouts and distortions caused by susceptibility effects in the current standard echo planar imaging (EPI)-based fMRI images are well-known problems and pose a major hurdle for the application of fMRI in several brain regions, many of which are related to language mapping in presurgical planning. Such artifacts are particularly problematic in patients with previous surgical resection cavities, craniotomy hardware, hemorrhage, and vascular malformation. A recently developed T2-prepared (T2prep) fMRI approach showed negligible distortion and dropouts in the entire brain even in the presence of large susceptibility effects. Here, we present initial results comparing T2prep-and multiband EPI-fMRI scans for presurgical language mapping using a sentence completion task in patients with brain tumor and epilepsy. In all patients scanned, T2prep-fMRI showed minimal image artifacts (distortion and dropout) and greater functional sensitivity than EPI-fMRI around the lesions containing blood products and in air-filled cavities. This enhanced sensitivity in T2prep-fMRI was also evidenced by the fact that functional activation during the sentence completion task was detected with T2prep-fMRI but not with EPI-fMRI in the affected areas with the same statistical threshold, whereas cerebrovascular reactivity during a breath-hold task was preserved in these same regions, implying intact neurovascular coupling in these patients. Although further investigations are required to validate these findings with invasive methods such as direct cortical stimulation mapping as the gold standard, this approach provides an alternative method for performing fMRI in brain regions with large susceptibility effects.

Although fMRI provides indirect measures of neural activity, the advent of fMRI has allowed for 1) the corroboration of significant animal findings in the human brain, and 2) the expansion of models to include more common human attributes that inform behavior. In this review, we briefly consider the neural basis of the blood oxygenation level dependent signal to set up a discussion of how fMRI studies have applied it in examining cognitive models in humans and the promise of using fMRI to advance such models. Specifically, we illustrate the contribution that fMRI has made to the study of reward processing, focusing on the role of the striatum in encoding reward-related learning signals that drive anticipatory and consummatory behaviors. For instance, we discuss how fMRI can be used to link neural signals (e.g., striatal responses to rewards) to individual differences in behavior and traits. While this functional segregation approach has been constructive to our understanding of reward-related functions, many fMRI studies have also benefitted from a functional integration approach that takes into account how interconnected regions (e.g., corticostriatal circuits) contribute to reward processing. We contend that future work using fMRI will profit from using a multimodal approach, such as combining fMRI with noninvasive brain stimulation tools (e.g., transcranial electrical stimulation), that can identify causal mechanisms underlying reward processing. Consequently, advancements in implementing fMRI will promise new translational opportunities to inform our understanding of psychopathologies.

High-quality reconstruction of fMRI data from undersampled measurements requires proper modeling of the data. We present an fMRI reconstruction approach based on modeling the fMRI signal as a sum of periodic and fixed rank components, for improved reconstruction from undersampled measurements. Methods: The proposed approach decomposes the fMRI signal into a component which has a fixed rank and a component consisting of a sum of periodic signals which is sparse in the temporal Fourier domain. Data reconstruction is performed by solving a constrained problem that enforces a fixed, moderate rank on one of the components, and a limited number of temporal frequencies on the other. Our approach is coined PEAR - PEriodic And fixed Rank separation for fast fMRI. Results: Experimental results include purely synthetic simulation, a simulation with real timecourses and retrospective undersampling of a real fMRI dataset. Evaluation was performed both quantitatively and visually versus ground truth, comparing PEAR to two additional recent methods for fMRI reconstruction from undersampled measurements. Results demonstrate PEAR's improvement in estimating the timecourses and activation maps versus the methods compared against at acceleration ratios of R = 8,10.66 (for simulated data) and R = 6.66,10 (for real data). Conclusions: This paper presents PEAR, an undersampled fMRI reconstruction approach based on decomposing the fMRI signal to periodic and fixed rank components. PEAR results in reconstruction with higher fidelity than when using a fixed-rank based model or a conventional Low-rank + Sparse algorithm. We have shown that splitting the functional information between the components leads to better modeling of fMRI, over state-of-the-art methods.

Sensitivity enhancement of task-evoked fMRI using ensemble empirical mode decomposition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Task-fMRI; Resting-state fMRI; fMRI sensitivity; Nonlinear; Nonstationary; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Hilbert-Huang transform	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; NOISE; SIGNAL; ARCHITECTURE; ACTIVATION; REDUCTION; NETWORKS	Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to investigate dynamic brain functions in neurological and psychological issues; however, high noise level limits its applicability for intensive and sophisticated investigations in the field of neuroscience. New method: To deal with both issue (low sensitivity and dynamic signal), we used ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), an adaptive data-driven analysis method for nonstationary and nonlinear features, to filter task-irrelevant noise from raw fMRI signals. Using both simulations and representative fMRI data, we optimized the analytic parameters and identified non-meaningful intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) to remove noise. Results: We revealed the following advantages of EEMD in fMRI analysis: (1) EEMD achieved high detectability for task engagement; (2) the functional sensitivity was markedly enhanced by removing task-irrelevant artifacts based on EEMD. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with other noise-removal methods (e.g., band-pass filtering and independent component analysis), the EEMD-based artifact-removal method exhibited better spatial specificity and superior Gaussianity of the resulting t-score distribution. Conclusions: We found that EEMD method was efficient to enhance the functional sensitivity of evoked fMRI. The same strategy would be applicable to resting-state fMRI signal in the general purpose.

Recent evidence suggests that parameters obtained with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are coupled with anesthetic depth. Therefore, we investigated whether parameters obtained with rs-fMRI, such as functional connectivity (FC), are also directly related to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses. MethodsA simple rs-fMRI protocol was implemented in a pharmacological fMRI study to evaluate the coupling between hemodynamic responses and FC under five anesthetics (-chloralose, isoflurane, medetomidine, thiobutabarbital, and urethane). Temporal change in the FC was evaluated at 1-hour interval. Supplementary forepaw stimulation experiments were also conducted. ResultsUnder thiobutabarbital anesthesia, FC was clearly coupled with nicotine-induced BOLD responses. Good correlation values were also obtained under isoflurane and medetomidine anesthesia. The observations in the thiobutabarbital group were supported by forepaw stimulation experiments. Additionally, the rs-fMRI protocol revealed significant temporal changes in the FC in the -chloralose, thiobutabarbital, and urethane groups. ConclusionOur results suggest that FC can be used to estimate brain hemodynamic responsiveness to stimuli and evaluate the level and temporal changes of anesthesia. Therefore, analysis of the fMRI baseline signal may be highly valuable tool for controlling the outcome of preclinical fMRI experiments. Magn Reson Med 78:1136-1146, 2017.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides full brain coverage with limited temporal resolution, while electroencephalography (EEG), estimates cortical activity with high temporal resolution. Combining them may provide improved network characterization. New Method: We examined relationships between EEG spatiospectral pattern timecourses and concurrent fMRI BOLD signals using canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with 1st and 2nd temporal derivatives in voxel-wise general linear models (GLM). HRF shapes were derived from EEG-fMRI time courses during "resting-state", visual oddball and semantic decision paradigms. Results: The resulting GLM F-maps self-organized into several different large-scale brain networks (LSBNs) often with different timing between EEG and fMRI revealed through differences in GLM-derived HRF shapes (e.g., with a lower time to peak than the canonical HRF). We demonstrate that some EEG spatiospectral patterns (related to concurrent fMRI) are weakly task-modulated. Comparison with existing method(s): Previously, we demonstrated 14 independent EEG spatiospectral patterns within this EEG dataset, stable across the resting-state, visual oddball and semantic decision paradigms. Here, we demonstrate that their time courses are significantly correlated with fMRI dynamics organized into LSBN structures. EEG-fMRI derived HRF peak appears earlier than the canonical HRF peak, which suggests limitations when assuming a canonical HRF shape in EEG-fMRI. Conclusions: This is the first study examining EEG-fMRI relationships among independent EEG spatiospectral patterns over different paradigms. The findings highlight the importance of considering different HRF shapes when spatiotemporally characterizing brain networks using EEG and fMRI.

Despite continuous improvements, it remains a challenging technique, and a standard methodology for data analysis is yet to be established. Here we review the methodologies that are currently available to address the challenges at each step of the data analysis pipeline. We start by surveying methods for preprocessing both EEG and fMRI data. On the EEG side, we focus on the correction for several MR-induced artifacts, particularly the gradient and pulse artifacts, as well as other sources of EEG artifacts. On the fMRI side, we consider image artifacts induced by the presence of EEG hardware inside the MR scanner, and the contamination of the fMRI signal by physiological noise of non-neuronal origin, including a review of several approaches to model and remove it. We then provide an overview of the approaches specifically employed for the integration of EEG and fMRI when using EEG to predict the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, the so-called EEG-informed fMRI integration strategy, the most commonly used strategy in EEG-fMRI research. Finally, we systematically review methods used for the extraction of EEG features reflecting neuronal phenomena of interest.

Albert; Panzeri, Stefano; Gozzi, Alessandro			Infraslow State Fluctuations Govern Spontaneous fMRI Network Dynamics	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GLOBAL SIGNAL; BRAIN; MOUSE; OSCILLATIONS	Spontaneous brain activity as assessed with resting-state fMRI exhibits rich spatiotemporal structure. However, the principles by which brain-wide patterns of spontaneous fMRI activity reconfigure and interact with each other remain unclear. We used a framewise clustering approach to map spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous fMRI activity with voxel resolution in the resting mouse brain. We show that brain-wide patterns of fMRI co-activation can be reliably mapped at the group and subject level, defining a restricted set of recurring brain states characterized by rich network structure. Importantly, we document that the identified fMRI states exhibit contrasting patterns of functional activity and coupled infraslow network dynamics, with each network state occurring at specific phases of global fMRI signal fluctuations. Finally, we show that autism-associated genetic alterations entail the engagement of atypical functional states and altered infraslow network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel set of fundamental principles guiding the spatiotemporal organization of resting-state fMRI activity and its disruption in brain disorders.

On the relationship between instantaneous phase synchrony and correlation-based sliding windows for time-resolved fMRI connectivity analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Time-resolved functional connectivity; Instantaneous phase synchrony; Sliding-windows	DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE FMRI; BRAIN; NETWORK; BOLD; FLUCTUATIONS; PARCELLATION	Correlation-based sliding window analysis (CSWA) is the most commonly used method to estimate time-resolved functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity. However, instantaneous phase synchrony analysis (IPSA) is gaining popularity mainly because it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. We aim to provide a systematic comparison between these two approaches, on temporal, topological and anatomical levels. For this purpose, we used resting-state fMRI data from two separate cohorts with different temporal resolutions (45 healthy subjects from Human Connectome Project fMRI data with repetition time of 0.72 s and 25 healthy subjects from a separate validation fMRI dataset with a repetition time of 3 s). For time-resolved functional connectivity analysis, we calculated tapered CSWA over a wide range of different window lengths that were compared to IPSA. We found a strong association in connectivity dynamics between IPSA and CSWA when considering the absolute values of CSWA. The association between CSWA and IPSA was stronger for a window length of similar to 20s (shorter than filtered fMRI wavelength) than similar to 100 s (longer than filtered fMRI wavelength), irrespective of the sampling rate of the underlying fMRI data. Narrow-band filtering of fMRI data (0.03-0.07 Hz) yielded a stronger relationship between IPSA and CSWA than wider-band (0.01-0.1 Hz). On a topological level, time-averaged IPSA and CSWA nodes were non-linearly correlated for both short (similar to 20 s) and long (similar to 100 s) windows, mainly because nodes with strong negative correlations (CSWA) displayed high phase synchrony (IPSA). IPSA and CSWA were anatomically similar in the default mode network, sensory cortex, insula and cerebellum. Our results suggest that IPSA and CSWA provide comparable characterizations of time-resolved fMRI connectivity for appropriately chosen window lengths. Although IPSA requires narrow-band fMRI filtering, it does not mandate a (semi-)arbitrary choice of window length and window overlap. A code for calculating IPSA is provided.

Building an EEG-fMRI Multi-Modal Brain Graph: A Concurrent EEG-fMRI Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; dynamic; multi-modal; brain graph; ICA	RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; TIME-VARYING CONNECTIVITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; HUMAN CONNECTOME; HEALTHY CONTROLS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; INTEGRATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY	The topological architecture of brain connectivity has been well characterized by graph theory based analysis. However, previous studies have primarily built brain graphs based on a single modality of brain imaging data. Here we develop a framework to construct multi-modal brain graphs using concurrent EEG-fMRI data which are simultaneously collected during eyes open (EC)) and eyes closed (EC) resting states. FMRI data are decomposed into independent components with associated time courses by group independent component analysis (ICA). EEG time series are segmented, and then spectral power time courses are computed and averaged within 5 frequency bands (delta; theta; alpha; beta; low gamma). EEG-fMRI brain graphs, with EEG electrodes and fMRI brain components serving as nodes, are built by computing correlations within and between fMRI ICA time courses and EEG spectral power time courses. Dynamic EEG-fMRI graphs are built using a sliding window method, versus static ones treating the entire time course as stationary. In global level, static graph measures and properties of dynamic graph measures are different across frequency bands and are mainly showing higher values in eyes closed than eyes open. Nodal level graph measures of a few brain components are also showing higher values during eyes closed in specific frequency bands. Overall, these findings incorporate fMRI spatial localization and EEG frequency information which could not be obtained by examining only one modality. This work provides a new approach to examine EEG-fMRI associations within a graph theoretic framework with potential application to many topics.

Functional neuroimaging for addiction medicine: From mechanisms to practical considerations	NEUROSCIENCE FOR ADDICTION MEDICINE: FROM PREVENTION TO REHABILITATION - METHODS AND INTERVENTIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review; Book Chapter						fMRI; Addiction medicine; Prediction; Measurement; Personalized	ALCOHOL-DEPENDENT PATIENTS; BRAIN-FUNCTION; HEROIN; USERS; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; STRESS; REWARD; CUES	During last 20 years, neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in people with drug addictions has introduced a wide range of quantitative biomarkers from brain's regional or network level activities during different cognitive functions. These quantitative biomarkers could be potentially used for assessment, planning, prediction, and monitoring for "addiction medicine" during screening, acute intoxication, admission to a program, completion of an acute program, admission to a long-term program, and postgraduation follow-up. In this chapter, we have briefly reviewed main neurocognitive targets for fMRI studies associated with addictive behaviors, main study types using fMRI among drug dependents, and potential applications for fMRI in addiction medicine. Main challenges and limitations for extending fMRI studies and evidences aiming at clinical applications in addiction medicine are also discussed. There is still a significant gap between available evidences from group-based fMRI studies and personalized decisions during daily practices in addiction medicine. It will be important to fill this gap with large-scale clinical trials and longitudinal studies using fMRI measures with a well-defined strategic plan for the future.

Pharmacological fMRI (pharma-fMRI) is a relatively new application, which is being used to elucidate the effects and mechanisms of pharmacological modulation of brain activity. Characterizing the effects of neuropharmacological agents on regional brain activity using fMRI is challenging because drugs modulate neuronal function in a wide variety of ways, including through receptor agonist, antagonist, and neurotransmitter reuptake blocker events. Here we review current knowledge on neurotransmitter-mediated blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI mechanisms as well as recently updated methodologies aimed at more fully describing the effects of neuropharmacologic agents on the BOLD signal. We limit our discussion to dopaminergic signaling as a useful lens through which to analyze and interpret neurochemical-mediated changes in the hemodynamic BOLD response. We also discuss the need for future studies that use multi-modal approaches to expand the understanding and application of pharma-fMRI.

Here, we present an overview of various unsupervised and supervised machine learning applications to rs-fMRI. We offer a methodical taxonomy of machine learning methods in restingstate fMRI. We identify three major divisions of unsupervised learning methods with regard to their applications to rs-fMRI, based on whether they discover principal modes of variation across space, time or population. Next, we survey the algorithms and rs-fMRI feature representations that have driven the success of supervised subjectlevel predictions. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of the burgeoning field of rs-fMRI from the perspective of machine learning applications.

A New Generation of Brain-Computer Interfaces Driven by Discovery of Latent EEG-fMRI Linkages Using Tensor Decomposition	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG; functional MRI; simultaneous EEG/fMRI; tensor decomposition	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REAL-TIME FMRI; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; COMBINING FMRI; BOLD SIGNAL; RESPONSES; STATE; COMMUNICATION; TASK	A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a setup permitting the control of external devices by decoding brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been extensively used for decoding brain activity since it is non-invasive, cheap, portable, and has high temporal resolution to allow real-time operation. Due to its poor spatial specificity, BCIs based on EEG can require extensive training and multiple trials to decode brain activity (consequently slowing down the operation of the BCI). On the other hand, BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are more accurate owing to its superior spatial resolution and sensitivity to underlying neuronal processes which are functionally localized. However, due to its relatively low temporal resolution, high cost, and lack of portability, fMRI is unlikely to be used for routine BCI. We propose a new approach for transferring the capabilities of fMRI to EEG, which includes simultaneous EEG/fMRI sessions for finding a mapping from EEG to fMRI, followed by a BCI run from only EEG data, but driven by fMRI-like features obtained from the mapping identified previously. Our novel data-driven method is likely to discover latent linkages between electrical and hemodynamic signatures of neural activity hitherto unexplored using model-driven methods, and is likely to serve as a template for a novel multi-modal strategy wherein cross-modal EEG-fMRI interactions are exploited for the operation of a unimodal EEG system, leading to a new generation of EEG-based BCIs.

A standardized and easily used method for the clinical assessment of fMRI scans could decrease the workload and make fMRI more attractive for clinical use. Purpose: To evaluate a standardized clinical approach for distance measurement between benign brain tumors and eloquent cortex in terms of the ability to predict pre- and postoperative neurological deficits after intraoperative neuronavigation-assisted surgery. Material and Methods: A retrospective study of 34 patients. The fMRI data were reanalyzed using a standardized distance measurement procedure combining data from both fMRI and three-dimensional T1 MRI scans. The pre- and postoperative neurological status of each patient was obtained from hospital records. Data analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis to determine whether the distance measured between the tumor margin and fMRI activity could serve as a predictor for neurological deficits. Results: An odds ratio of 0.89mm(-1) (P=0.03) was found between the risk of preoperative neurological motor deficits and the tumor-fMRI distance. An odds ratio of 0.82mm(-1) (P=0.04) was found between the risk of additional postoperative neurological motor deficits and the tumor-fMRI distance. The tumor was radically removed in 10 cases; five patients experienced additional postoperative motor deficits (tumor-fMRI distance <18mm) and five did not (tumor-fMRI distance >18mm) (P=0.008). Conclusion: This study indicates that the distance measured between the tumor margin and fMRI activation could serve as a valuable predictor of neurological motor deficits.

However, the use of fMRI in drug development continues to be relatively limited because of a variety of technical, biological, and strategic barriers that continue to limit progress. Here, we briefly review the roles that fMRI can have in the drug development process and the requirements it must meet to be useful in this setting. We then provide an update on our current understanding of the strengths and limitations of fMRI as a tool for drug developers and recommend activities to enhance its utility.

Constrained temporal parallel decomposition for EEG-fMRI fusion	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; simultaneous EEG/fMRI; ICA; fusion	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG/FMRI ANALYSIS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; MEMORY TASK; HUMAN BRAIN; ICA; LOCALIZATION; ARTIFACTS	Objective. Multimodal neuroimaging has become a common practice in neuroscience research. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a popular multimodal recording approach due to the complementary spatiotemporal relationship between the two modalities. Several data fusion techniques have been proposed in the literature for EEG-fMRI fusion, including joint-ICA and parallel-ICA frameworks. Previous EEG-fMRI fusion approaches have used sensor-level EEG features. Recently, we introduced source-space ICA for EEG-MEG source reconstruction and component identification, which was shown to be a superior alternative to sensor-space ICA. Approach. Here, we extend source-space ICA to the fusion of EEG-fMRI data. Additionally, we incorporate the use of a paradigm signal (constrained) and a lag-based signal decomposition approach to accommodate recent findings demonstrating the potentially variable lag structure between electrophysiological and BOLD signals. We evaluated this method on simulated concurrent EEG-fMRI during a boxcar task design, as well as real concurrent EEG-fMRI data from three participants performing an N-Back working memory task. The block diagram of the algorithm and corresponding source codes are provided. Main results. Based on the results of the real working memory task, for all three subjects, one frontal theta component, and one right posterior alpha component had the highest contribution coefficients (similar to 0.5) to the paradigm-related fused component. There were also two more alpha band components with contribution coefficients of 0.3. The highest contributing fMRI component (similar to 0.8) was one known in the literature to be related to the attention network. The second fMRI component was related to the well-known default mode network, with a contribution coefficient of 0.3. Significance. The proposed EEG-fMRI fusion approach, is capable of estimating the brain maps of the EEG and fMRI for the fused components and account for the variable lag structure between electrophysiological and BOLD signals.

In addition, recent studies have recommended incorporating cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) imaging into clinical fMRI to evaluate the risk of lesion-induced neurovascular uncoupling (NVU). Although each of these imaging techniques possesses its own advantage for presurgical mapping, a specialized clinical software that integrates the three complementary techniques and promptly outputs the analyzed results to radiology and surgical navigation systems in a clinical format is still lacking. We developed the Integrated fMRI for Clinical Research (IClinfMRI) software to facilitate these needs. Beyond the independent processing of task-fMRI, rs-fMRI, and CVR mapping, IClinfMRI encompasses three unique functions: (1) supporting the interactive rs-fMRI mapping while visualizing task-fMRI results (or results from published meta-analysis) as a guidance map, (2) indicating/visualizing the NVU potential on analyzed fMRI maps, and (3) exporting these advanced mapping results in a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format that are ready to export to a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and a surgical navigation system. In summary, IClinfMRI has the merits of efficiently translating and integrating state-of-the-art imaging techniques for presurgical functional mapping and clinical fMRI studies.

To reduce this problem, distortion correction (DC) with field map is widely used for both task and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Although DC with field map has been reported to improve the quality of task fMRI, little is known about its effects on rs-fMRI. Here, we tested the influence of field-map DC on rs-fMRI results using two rs-fMRI datasets derived from 40 healthy subjects: one with DC (DC+) and the other without correction (DC-). Independent component analysis followed by the dual regression approach was used for evaluation of resting-state functional connectivity networks (RSN). We also obtained the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency signal power (0.01-0.1 Hz and above 0.1 Hz, respectively; LFHF ratio) to assess the quality of rs-fMRI signals. For comparison of RSN between DC+ and DC-datasets, the default mode network showed more robust functional connectivity in the DC+ dataset than the DC-dataset. Basal ganglia RSN showed some decreases in functional connectivity primarily in white matter, indicating imperfect registration/ normalization without DC. Supplementary seed-based and simulation analyses supported the utility of DC. Furthermore, we found a higher LFHF ratio after field map correction in the anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and cerebellum. In conclusion, field map DC improved detection of functional connectivity derived from low-frequency rs-fMRI signals. We encourage researchers to include a DC step in the preprocessing pipeline of rs-fMRI analysis.

Sources of Variation Influencing Concordance between Functional MRI and Direct Cortical Stimulation in Brain Tumor Surgery	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						preoperative fMRI; direct cortical stimulation; behavioral testing; concordance; awake craniotomy; glioma; language; motor	LANGUAGE TASKS; AWAKE SURGERY; MOTOR CORTEX; FMRI; ACTIVATION; AREA; REPRODUCIBILITY; LOCALIZATION; VALIDATION; LOCATION	Object: Preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains a promising method to aid in the surgical management of patients diagnosed with brain tumors. For patients that are candidates for awake craniotomies, surgical decisions can potentially be improved by fMRI but this depends on the level of concordance between preoperative brain maps and the maps provided by the gold standard intraoperative method, direct cortical stimulation (DCS). There have been numerous studies of the concordance between fMRI and DCS using sensitivity and specificity measures, however the results are variable across studies and the key factors influencing variability are not well understood. Thus, the present work addresses the influence of technical factors on fMRI and DCS concordance. Methods: Motor and language mapping data were collected for a group of glioma patients (n = 14) who underwent both preoperative fMRI and intraoperative DCS in an awake craniotomy procedure for tumor removal. Normative fMRI data were also acquired in a healthy control group (n = 12). The fMRI and DOS mapping data were co-registered; true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) occurrences were tabulated over the exposed brain surface. Sensitivity and specificity were measured for the total group, and for the motor and language sub-groups. The influence of grid placement, fMRI statistical thresholding, and task standardization were assessed. Correlations between proportions of agreement and error were also carefully scrutinized to evaluate concordance in more detail. Results: Concordance was significantly better for motor vs. language mapping. There was an inverse relationship between TP and TN with increasing statistical threshold, and FP dominated the total error. Sensitivity and specificity were reduced when tasks were not standardized across fMRI and DOS. Conclusions: Although the agreement between fMRI and DCS is good, variability is introduced by technical factors that can diminish the quality of patient data. Neurosurgeons should evaluate the usefulness of fMRI data while considering that (a) discordance arises primarily from FP fMRI results; (b) there is an inherent trade-off between sensitivity and specificity with fMRI statistical threshold; and (c) best results are achieved using batteries of tasks that are standardized across both mapping methods.

However, activities of brain regions which modulate or indirectly participate in the response to a specific task are not event-related. Event-related fMRI can't locate these regulatory regions, detrimental to the integrity of the result that event-related fMRI revealed. Direct-current EEG shifts (DC shifts) have been found linked to the inner brain activity, a fusion DC shifts-fMRI method may have the ability to reveal a more complete response of the brain. In this study, we used DC shifts-fMRI to verify that even when responding to a very simple task, (1) The response of the brain is more complicated than event-related fMRI generally revealed and (2) DC shifts-fMRI have the ability of revealing brain regions whose responses are not in event-related way. We used a classical and simple paradigm which is often used in auditory cortex tonotopic mapping. Data were recorded from 50 subjects (25 male, 25 female) who were presented with randomly presented pure tone sequences with six different frequencies (200, 400, 800, 1,600, 3,200, 6,400 Hz). Our traditional fMRI results are consistent with previous findings that the activations are concentrated on the auditory cortex. Our DC shifts-fMRI results showed that the cingulate-caudate-thalamus network which underpins sustained attention is positively activated while the dorsal attention network and the right middle frontal gyrus which underpin attention orientation are negatively activated. The regional-specific correlations between DC shifts and brain networks indicate the complexity of the response of the brain even to a simple task and that the DC shifts can effectively reflect these non-event-related inner brain activities.

Due to variabilities in fMRI data and the limitation of the collection of human fMRI data, it is not easy to train an efficient and robust supervised-learning classifier for fMRI data. Among various classification techniques, sparse representation classifier (SRC) exhibits a state-of-the-art classification performance in image classification. However, SRC has rarely been applied to fMRI-based decoding. This study aimed to improve SRC using unlabeled testing samples to allow it to be effectively applied to fMRI-based decoding. We proposed a semisupervised-learning SRC with an average coefficient (semiSRC-AVE) method that performed the classification using the average coefficient of each class instead of the reconstruction error and selectively updated the training dataset using new testing data with high confidence to improve the performance of SRC. Simulated and real fMRI experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility and robustness of semiSRC-AVE. The results of the simulated and real fMRI experiments showed that semiSRC-AVE significantly outperformed supervised learning SRC with an average coefficient (SRC-AVE) method and showed better performance than the other three semisupervised learning methods.

Here, we present a miniaturized, wireless platform-"MR-Link" (Multimodal Recording Link) that provides a hardware solution for simultaneous electrophysiological and fMRI signal acquisition. The device detects the changes in the electromagnetic field during fMRI to synchronize amplification and sampling of electrophysiological signals with minimal artifacts. It wirelessly transmits the recorded data at a frequency detectable by the MR-receiver coil. The transmitted data is readily separable from MRI in the frequency domain. To demonstrate its efficacy, we used this device to record electrocardiograms and somatosensory evoked potential during concurrent fMRI scans. The device minimized the fMRI-induced artifacts in electrophysiological data and wirelessly transmitted the data back to the receiver coil without compromising the fMRI signal quality. The device is compact (22 mm dia., 2 gms) and can be placed within the MRI bore to precisely synchronize with fMRI. Therefore, MR-Link offers an inexpensive system by eliminating the need for amplifiers with a high dynamic range, high-speed sampling, additional storage, or synchronization hardware for electrophysiological signal acquisition. It is expected to enable a broader range of applications of simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiology in animals and humans.

Further, vigorous debates exist on whether global signals ought to be removed from fMRI data. However, surprisingly little research has focused on the empirical properties of whole-brain fMRI signals. Here we map the spatial and temporal properties of the global signal, individually, in 1000+ fMRI scans. Variance in the global fMRI signal is strongly linked to head motion, to hardware artifacts, and to respiratory patterns and their attendant physiologic changes. Many techniques used to prepare fMRI data for analysis fail to remove these uninteresting kinds of global signal fluctuations. Thus, many studies include, at the time of analysis, prominent global effects of yawns, breathing changes, and head motion, among other signals. Such artifacts will mimic dynamic neural activity and will spuriously alter signal covariance throughout the brain. Methods capable of isolating and removing global artifactual variance while preserving putative "neural" variance are needed; this paper adopts no position on the topic of global signal regression.

High-resolution fMRI has shown laminar differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF), volume (CBV), and neurovascular coupling. Features and processes that were previously lumped into a single voxel become spatially distinct at high resolution. These features can be vascular compartments such as veins, arteries, and capillaries, or cortical layers and columns, which can have differences in metabolism. Mesoscopic models of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response therefore need to be expanded, for instance, to incorporate laminar differences in the coupling between neural activity, metabolism and the hemodynamic response. Here we discuss biological and methodological factors that affect the modeling and interpretation of high-resolution fMRI data. We also illustrate with examples from neuropharmacology and the negative BOLD response how combining BOLD with CBF- and CBV-based fMRI methods can provide additional information about neurovascular coupling, and can aid modeling and interpretation of high-resolution fMRI.

This prior information has not been included in the K-SVD algorithm when applied to fMRI data analysis. In this paper, we propose three variants of the K-SVD algorithm dedicated to fMRI data analysis by accounting for this prior information. The proposed algorithms differ from the K-SVD in their sparse coding and dictionary update stages. The first two algorithms account for the known correlation structure in the fMRI data by using the squared Q, R-norm instead of the Frobenius norm for matrix approximation. The third and last algorithms account for both the known correlation structure in the fMRI data and the temporal smoothness. The temporal smoothness is incorporated in the dictionary update stage via regularization of the dictionary atoms obtained with penalization. The performance of the proposed dictionary learning algorithms is illustrated through simulations and applications on real fMRI data.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy: Insights from Combined Recording Studies	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						fMRI; fNIRS; multimodal; combined recording; cognition	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SIMULTANEOUS FNIRS; CONCURRENT FMRI; BOLD FMRI; NIRS-FMRI; OXYGENATION; ACTIVATION; CONTRAST; METABOLISM	Although blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely available, non-invasive technique that offers excellent spatial resolution, it remains limited by practical constraints imposed by the scanner environment. More recently, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as an alternative hemodynamic-based approach that possesses a number of strengths where fMRI is limited, most notably in portability and higher tolerance for motion. To date, fNIRS has shown promise in its ability to shed light on the functioning of the human brain in populations and contexts previously inaccessible to fMRI. Notable contributions include infant neuroimaging studies and studies examining full-body behaviors, such as exercise. However, much like fMRI, fNIRS has technical constraints that have limited its application to clinical settings, including a lower spatial resolution and limited depth of recording. Thus, by combining fMRI and fNIRS in such a way that the two methods complement each other, a multimodal imaging approach may allow for more complex research paradigms than is feasible with either technique alone. In light of these issues, the purpose of the current review is to: (1) provide an overview of fMRI and fNIRS and their associated strengths and limitations; (2) review existing combined fMRI-fNIRS recording studies; and (3) discuss how their combined use in future research practices may aid in advancing modern investigations of human brain function.

However, a more flexible and easy-to-use toolbox for EEG-fMRI multimodal fusion is still lacking. In this study, we therefore developed a freely available and open-source MATLAB graphical user interface toolbox, known as the Neuroscience Information Toolbox (NIT), for EEG-fMRI multimodal fusion analysis. The NIT consists of three modules: (1) the fMRI module, which has batch fMRI preprocessing, nuisance signal removal, bandpass filtering, and calculation of resting-state measures; (2) the EEG module, which includes artifact removal, extracting EEG features (event onset, power, and amplitude), and marking interesting events; and (3) the fusion module, in which fMRI-informed EEG analysis and EEG-informed fMRI analysis are included. The NIT was designed to provide a convenient and easy-to-use toolbox for researchers, especially for novice users. The NIT can be downloaded for free at http://www.neuro.uestc.edu.cn/NIT.html, and detailed information, including the introduction of NIT, user's manual and example data sets, can also be observed on this website.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has played an important role in our efforts to understand how Alzheimer's disease alters brain function. Using fMRI in animal models of Alzheimer's disease has the potential to provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the observations made in human clinical fMRI studies. However, using fMRI in animal models of Alzheimer's disease presents some unique challenges. Here, we highlight some of these challenges and discuss potential solutions for researchers interested in performing fMRI in animal models. First, we briefly summarize our current understanding of Alzheimer's disease from a mechanistic standpoint. We then overview the wide array of animal models available for studying this disease and how to choose the most appropriate model to study, depending on which aspects of the condition researchers seek to investigate. Finally, we discuss the contributions of fMRI to our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and the issues to consider when designing fMRI studies for animal models, such as differences in brain activity based on anesthetic choice and ways to interrogate more specific questions in rodents beyond those that can be addressed in humans. The goal of this article is to provide information on the utility of fMRI, and approaches to consider when using fMRI, for studies of Alzheimer's disease in animal models.

The relationship between functional magnetic resonance imaging activation, diffusion tensor imaging, and training effects	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						Diffusion tensor imaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging; training	WORKING-MEMORY; FMRI	While the relationship between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements and training effects is explored by Voelker et al. (this issue), a cursory discussion of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements categorizes increased activation with findings of greater white matter integrity. Evidence of the relationship between fMRI activation and white matter integrity is conflicting, as is the relationship between fMRI activation and training effects. An examination of the changes in fMRI activation in response to training is helpful, but the relationship between DTI and fMRI activation, particularly in the context of white matter changes, must be examined further before general conclusions can be drawn.

Methods: Language mapping using CSM, hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS were compared in nine patients with epilepsy. Considering CSM as reference, we compared language mapping approaches based on hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS using their sensitivity, specificity, and the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Results: Our results show that areas involved in language processing can be identified by hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS. The average sensitivity/specificity of hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS across all patients was 100%/85%, 50%/80%, and 67%/66%, respectively. The average area under the ROC curve of hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS across CSM-positive patients was 0.98, 0.76, and 0.68, respectively. Conclusions: There is considerable concordance between CSM, hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS language mapping. Our results reveal that hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS are valuable tools for presurgical language mapping. Significance: Language mapping on the basis of hgECoG, fMRI, and TMS can provide important additional information, therefore, these methods can be used in conjunction with CSM or as an alternative, when the latter is deemed impractical.

This study aimed to probe the vulnerability of BOLD fMRI to CO and determine whether it may constitute a significant neuroimaging confound. Low-level (6ppm exhaled) CO effects on BOLD response were assessed in 12 healthy never-smokers on two separate experimental days (CO and air control). fMRI tasks were breath-holds (hypercapnia), visual stimulation and fingertapping. BOLD fMRI response was lower during breath holds, visual stimulation and fingertapping in the CO protocol compared to the air control protocol. Behavioural and physiological measures remained unchanged. We conclude that BOLD fMRI might be vulnerable to changes in baseline CO, and suggest exercising caution when imaging populations exposed to elevated CO levels. Further work is required to fully elucidate the impact on CO on fMRI and its underlying mechanisms.

It hereby can help improve the accuracy of EEG source localization. However, most of the current methods directly penalize the sources whose fMRI activation probability is low and estimate the sources activities at every time point. Thus, they do not account for the temporal interrelated and non-stationary features of electromagnetic brain signals, and some are too much dependent on the fMRI prior. Here, we propose a new fMRI informed EEG source localization method and is termed fMRI-informed spatio-temporal unifying tomography (FIST). It uses a mixed norm constraint defined in terms of time frequency decomposition of the sources and combines it with fMRI prior. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. Both simulated and real EEG data are applied to assess the performance of the proposed method. Compared with L2-norm constrained methods, FIST has the superiority brain source estimation both in the spatial and temporal domains. By virtue of the fMRI information as a prior, FIST has great improvement in spatial accuracy and computational efficiency, when comparing with the method which only uses mixed-norm constraint. In addition, FIST shows good ability to select the fMRI priors to get a better estimation without totally depending on the prior, when comparing with the method which also has fMRI prior information.

Coil Compression in Simultaneous Multislice Functional MRI with Concentric Ring Slice-GRAPPA and SENSE	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						coil compression; simultaneous multislice; multiband; GRAPPA; SENSE; fMRI; GRABSMACC	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; SPIRAL TRAJECTORIES; PARALLEL; FMRI; ACQUISITIONS; DESIGN; NOISE; ARRAY	Purpose: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a useful way to accelerate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As acceleration becomes more aggressive, an increasingly larger number of receive coils are required to separate the slices, which significantly increases the computational burden. We propose a coil compression method that works with concentric ring non-Cartesian SMS imaging and should work with Cartesian SMS as well. We evaluate the method on fMRI scans of several subjects and compare it to standard coil compression methods. Methods: The proposed method uses a slice-separation k-space kernel to simultaneously compress coil data into a set of virtual coils. Five subjects were scanned using both non-SMS fMRI and SMS fMRI with three simultaneous slices. The SMS fMRI scans were processed using the proposed method, along with other conventional methods. Code is available at https://github.com/alcu/sms. Results: The proposed method maintained functional activation with a fewer number of virtual coils than standard SMS coil compression methods. Compression of non-SMS fMRI maintained activation with a slightly lower number of virtual coils than the proposed method, but does not have the acceleration advantages of SMS fMRI. Conclusion: The proposed method is a practical way to compress and reconstruct concentric ring SMS data and improves the preservation of functional activation over standard coil compression methods in fMRI.

We investigated whether SZ patients and BD patients show aberrant fMRI adaptation for object perception. About 52 SZ patients, 55 BD patients, and 53 community controls completed an object discrimination task with three conditions: the same object presented twice, two exemplars from the same category, and two exemplars from different categories. We also administered two functional localizer tasks. A region of interest analysis was employed to evaluate a priori hypotheses about the lateral occipital complex (LOC) and early visual cortex (EVC). An exploratory whole brain analysis was also conducted. In the LOC and EVC, controls showed the expected reduced fMRI responses to repeated presentation of the same objects compared with different objects (i.e., fMRI adaptation for objects, p<.001). SZ patients showed an adaptation effect that was significantly smaller compared with controls. BD patients showed a lack of fMRI adaptation. The whole brain analyses showed enhanced fMRI responses to repeated presentation of the same objects only in BD patients in several brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex. This study was the first to employ fMRI adaptation for objects in SZ and BD. The current findings provide empirical evidence of aberrant fMRI adaptation in the visual cortex in SZ and BD, but in distinctly different ways.

The aim of the current study was to quantify neural activity using combined fMRI-MRS at 7 T. BOLD-fMRI and semi-LASER localization MRS data were acquired from the visual cortex of 13 participants during short blocks (64 s) of flickering checkerboards. We demonstrate a correlation between glutamate and BOLD-fMRI time courses (R=0.381, p=0.031). In addition, we show increases in BOLD-fMRI (1.43 +/- 0.17%) and glutamate concentrations (0.15 +/- 0.05 I. U., similar to 2%) during visual stimulation. In contrast, we observed no change in glutamate concentrations in resting state MRS data during sham stimulation periods. Spectral line width changes generated by the BOLD-response were corrected using line broadening. In summary, our results establish the feasibility of concurrent measurements of BOLD-fMRI and neurochemicals using a novel combined fMRI-MRS sequence. Our findings strengthen the link between glutamate and functional activity in the human brain by demonstrating a significant correlation of BOLD-fMRI and glutamate over time, and by showing similar to 2% glutamate increases during 64 s of visual stimulation. Our tool may become useful for studies characterizing functional dynamics between neurochemicals and hemodynamics in health and disease.	[Ipa, I.

The most prevailing fMRI contrast, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, specifically results from a complex interplay between oxygen metabolism, blood flow, and blood volume reactions. Therefore, because fMRI indirectly measures brain function, the spatial accuracy of these blood-borne signal changes to the true neuronal activity comes into question, especially at high resolutions. To better interpret the neural basis of fMRI, these properties have been studied in localized neural circuits of the brain using fMRI with blood flow, blood volume, and BOLD contrasts, as well as optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI), which shares similar signal sources as fMRI. Here, we review how submillimeter-scale high-resolution fMRI and OISI in the visual cortex columnar and olfactory bulb laminar models have advanced our basic knowledge of the spatial localization of the individual hemodynamic signals and neurovascular coupling mechanisms.

Many of the longstanding concerns about fMRI adaptation have received empirical support from neurophysiological studies over the last decade. We review these studies here, and also consider neuroimaging studies that have investigated how fMRI adaptation effects are influenced by high-level perceptual processes. The results of these studies further emphasize the need to interpret fMRI adaptation results with caution, but they also provide helpful guidance for more accurate interpretation and better experimental design. In addition, we argue that rather than being used as a proxy for measurements of neuronal stimulus selectivity, fMRI adaptation may be most useful for studying population-level adaptation effects across cortical processing hierarchies.

Comparison of BOLD, diffusion-weighted fMRI and ADC-fMRI for stimulation of the primary visual system with a block paradigm	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Diffusion-weighted functional MRI; BOLD; ADC; Primary visual system V1; Block stimulation paradigm; IVIM; Cytoarchitecture; Cytoarchitectonic; Grey matter	SPATIAL LOCALIZATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; NEURONAL ACTIVATION; SPIN-ECHO; SIGNAL; BRAIN; COEFFICIENT; CONTRAST; WATER; INFERENCE	The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect is extensively used for functional MRI (fMRI) but presents some limitations. Diffusion-weighted fMRI (DfMRI) has been proposed as a method more tightly linked to neuronal activity. This work proposes a protocol of DfMRI acquired for several b-values and diffusion directions that is compared to gradient-echo BOLD (GE-BOLD) and to repeated spin-echo BOLD (SE-BOLD, acquisitions performed with b = 0 s/mm(2)), which was also used to ensure the reproducibility of the response. A block stimulation paradigm of the primary visual system (V1) was performed in 12 healthy subjects with checkerboard alternations (2 Hz frequency). DfMRI was performed at 3 T with 5 b-values (b = 1500, 1000, 500, 250, 0 s/mm(2)) with TR/TE = 1004/93 ms, Delta/delta = 45.4 ms/30 ms, and 6 spatial directions for diffusion measures. GE-BOLD was performed with a similar block stimulation design timing. Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)-fMRI was computed with all b-values used. An identical Z-score level was used for all fMRI modalities for the comparison of volumes of activation. ADC-fMRI and SE-BOLD fMRI activation locations were compared in a voxel-based analysis to a cytoarchitectural probability map of Vl. SE-BOLD activation volumes represented only 55% of the GE-BOLD activation volumes (P < 0.0001). DfMRI activation volumes averaged for all b-values acquired represented only 12% of GE-BOLD (P < 0.0001) and only 22% of SE-BOLD activation volumes (P < 0.005). Compared to SE-BOLD-fMRI, ADC-fMRI activations showed fewer pixels outside of V1 and a higher average probability of belonging to V1. DfMRI and ADC-fMRI acquisition at 3 T could be easily post-processed with common neuro-imaging software. DfMRI and ADC-fMRI activation volumes were significantly smaller than those obtained with SE-BOLD. ADCfMRI activations were more precisely localized in V1 than those of SE-BOLD-fMRI. This validated the increased capability of ADC-fMRI compared to BOLD to enhance the precision of localizing an fMRI activation in the cytoarchitectural zone V1, thereby justifying the use of ADC-fMRI for neuro-scientific studies.

Spurious correlations in simultaneous EEG-fMRI driven by in-scanner movement	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG-BOLD correlations; Motion artifacts; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Theta oscillations; Subsequent memory effect	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; PULSE ARTIFACT; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG/FMRI; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; CONCURRENT FMRI; ALPHA-RHYTHM; BOLD SIGNAL; MOTION	Simultaneous EEG-fMRI provides an increasingly attractive research tool to investigate cognitive processes with high temporal and spatial resolution. However, artifacts in EEG data introduced by theMR scanner still remain a major obstacle. This study, employing commonly used artifact correction steps, shows that head motion, one overlooked major source of artifacts in EEG-fMRI data, can cause plausible EEG effects and EEG-BOLD correlations. Specifically, low-frequency EEG (<20 Hz) is strongly correlated with in-scanner movement. Accordingly, minor head motion (<0.2 mm) induces spurious effects in a twofold manner: Small differences in task-correlated motion elicit spurious low-frequency effects, and, as motion concurrently influences fMRI data, EEG-BOLD correlations closely match motion-fMRI correlations. We demonstrate these effects in a memory encoding experiment showing that obtained theta power (similar to 3-7 Hz) effects and channel-level theta-BOLD correlations reflect motion in the scanner. These findings highlight an important caveat that needs to be addressed by future EEG-fMRI studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Disrupted functional connectivity affects resting state based language lateralization	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Intrinsic functional connectivity; Lesions; Language lateralization; Resting state	BRAIN-TUMOR PATIENTS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; MOTOR NETWORK; DEFAULT MODE; FMRI; MRI; ACTIVATION; DOMINANCE; SURGERY	Pre-operative assessment of language localization and lateralization is critical to preserving brain function after lesion or epileptogenic tissue resection. Task fMRI (t-fMRI) has been extensively and reliably used to this end, but resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is emerging as an alternative pre-operative brain mapping method that is independent of a patient's ability to comply with a task. We sought to evaluate if language lateralization obtained fromrs-fMRI can replace standard assessment using t-fMRI. In a group of 43 patients scheduled for pre-operative fMRI brain mapping and 17 healthy controls, we found that existing methods of determining rs-fMRI lateralization by considering interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity are inadequate compared to t-fMRI when applied to the language network. We determined that this was attributable to widespread but nuanced disturbances in the functional connectivity of the language network in patients. We found changes in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity that were dependent on lesion location, and particularly impacted patients with lesions in the left temporal lobe. We then tested whether a simpler measure of functional connectivity to the language network has a better relation to t-fMRI based language lateralization. Remarkably, we found that functional connectivity between the language network and the frontal pole, and superior frontal gyrus, as well as the supramarginal gyrus, significantly correlated to task based language lateralization indices in both patients and healthy controls. These findings are consistent with prior work with epilepsy patients, and provide a framework for evaluating language lateralization at rest. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recently, the existence of persistent and stable brain networks of functional nature has been revealed; in particular these so-called intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) appear to link patterns of resting state and task-related state connectivity. These networks provide an opportunity of functionally-derived description and interpretation of fMRI maps, that may be especially important in cases where the maps are predominantly task-unrelated, such as studies of spontaneous brain activity e.g. in the case of seizure-related fMRI maps in epilepsy patients or sleep states. Here we present a new toolbox (ICN_Atlas) aimed at facilitating the interpretation of fMRI data in the context of ICN. More specifically, the new methodology was designed to describe fMRI maps in function-oriented, objective and quantitative way using a set of 15 metrics conceived to quantify the degree of 'engagement' of ICNs for any given fMRI-derived statistical map of interest. We demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a highly reliable quantification of fMRI activation maps using a publicly available longitudinal (test-retest) resting-state fMRI dataset. The utility of the ICN_Atlas is also illustrated on a parametric task-modulation fMRI dataset, and on a dataset of a patient who had repeated seizures during resting-state fMRI, confirmed on simultaneously recorded EEG. The proposed ICN_Atlas toolbox is freely available for download at http://icnatlas.com and at http://www.nitrc.org for researchers to use in their fMRI investigations.

J	Huang, XL; Long, ZL; Lei, X				Huang, Xiaoli; Long, Zhiliang; Lei, Xu			Electrophysiological signatures of the resting-state fMRI global signal: A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Global signal; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Reference electrode standardization technique	ANTI-CORRELATED NETWORKS; AVERAGE REFERENCE; BRAIN; VIGILANCE; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; REGRESSION; AMPLITUDE; PATTERNS	Background: The global signal of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) constitutes an intrinsic fluctuation and presents an opportunity to characterize and understand the activity of the whole brain. Recently, evidence that the global signal contains neurophysiologic information has been growing, but the global signal of electroencephalography (EEG) has never been determined. New methods: We developed a new method to obtain the EEG global signal. The EEG global signal was reconstructed by the reference electrode standardization technique and represented the outer cortical electrophysiological activity. To investigate its relationship with the global signal of resting-state fMRI, a simultaneous EEG-fMRI signal was recorded, and this was analyzed in 24 subjects. Results: We found that the global signal of resting-state fMRI showed a positive correlation with power fluctuations of the EEG global signal in the gamma band (30-45 Hz) and a negative correlation in the low-frequency band (4-20 Hz). Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with the global signal of fMRI, the global signal of EEG provides more temporal information about outer cortical neural activity. Conclusions: These results provide new evidence for the electrophysiology information of the global signal of resting-state fMRI. More importantly, due to its high correlation with the fMRI global signal, the EEG global signal may serve as a new biomarker for neurological disorders.

Until now, the somatosensory-evoked responses in anesthetized mice are often widespread and inconsistent across reports. Here, we adopted a ketamine and xylazine mixture for mouse fMRI, which is relatively new anesthetics in fMRI experiments. Forepaw stimulation frequency was optimized using cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted optical imaging (n = 11) and blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI with a gradient-echo time of 16 ms at 9.4 T, and 4 Hz stimulation with 0.5 ms and 0.5 mA pulses induced the highest hemodynamic response. For 20-s 4-Hz unilateral forepaw stimulation, localized BOLD activity was consistently found in the contralateral primary forelimb somatosensory cortex (S1FL), while no significant change was observed in the ipsilateral S1FL. The mean magnitude was 1.44 +/- 0.20% SEM (n = 9) in the contralateral S1FL and 0.69 +/- 0.10% in the contralateral thalamus. The variability of evoked fMRI responses across sessions was investigated by comparing with resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) functional connectivity (FC). Evoked responses in S1FL were correlated positively with rsfMRI FC between bilateral S1FL (r = 0.63 to 0.69) and negatively with FC between S1FL and the anterior cingulate cortex (r = -0.50 to -0.57), suggesting that rsfMRI FC is a good index of the evoked fMRI response and anesthetized animal condition. Finally, three weekly fMRI scans were performed in 5 mice, and localized activity was reproducibly observed in S1FL, with a success rate of 70-95%. In summary, our developed fMRI protocol can be used for mapping functions of mouse models.

However, noise from human physiological motion is an unresolved problem associated with this technique. Following the unexpected previous result that group differences in head motion between control and patient groups caused group differences in the resting-state network with RS-fMRI, we reviewed the effects of human physiological noise caused by subject motion, especially motion of the head, on functional connectivity at rest detected with RS-fMRI. The aim of the present study was to review head motion artifact with RS-fMRI, individual and patient population differences in head motion, and correction methods for head motion artifact with RS-fMRI. Numerous reports have described new methods [e.g., scrubbing, regional displacement interaction (RDI)] for motion correction on RS-fMRI, many of which have been successful in reducing this negative influence. However, the influence of head motion could not be entirely excluded by any of these published techniques. Therefore, in performing RS-fMRI studies, head motion of the participants should be quantified with measurement technique (e.g., framewise displacement). Development of a more effective correction method would improve the accuracy of RS-fMRI analysis.

Feature selection or extraction methods play an important role in the successful application of machine learning techniques to classifying fMRI data by appropriately reducing the dimensionality of the data. While whole-brain fMRI data contains large numbers of voxels, the curse of dimensionality problem may limit the feature selection/extraction and classification performance of traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a tensor neural network (TensorNet) to extract the essential and discriminative features from the whole-brain fMRI data. The tensor train model was employed to construct a simple and shallow neural network and compress a large number of network weight parameters. The proposed framework can avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, and allow us to extract effective patterns from the whole-brain fMRI data. Furthermore, it reveals a new perspective for analyzing complex fMRI data with a large numbers of voxels, through compressing the number of parameters in a neural network. Experimental results confirmed that our proposed classification framework based on TensorNet outperforms traditional methods based on an SVM classifier for multi-class fMRI data.

Because fMRI measures the indirect and convoluted signals of brain activities at a lower temporal resolution, complex differential equation modeling methods (e.g., Dynamic Causal Modeling) are usually employed to infer the neuronal processes and to fit the resulting fMRI signals. However, this modeling strategy is computationally expensive and remains to be mostly a confirmatory or hypothesis-driven approach. One major statistical challenge here is to infer, in a data-driven fashion, the underlying differential equation models from fMRI data. In this paper, we propose a causal dynamic network (CDN) method to estimate brain activations and connections simultaneously. Our method links the observed fMRI data with the latent neuronal states modeled by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. Using the basis function expansion approach in functional data analysis, we develop an optimization-based criterion that combines data-fitting errors and ODE fitting errors. We also develop and implement a block coordinate-descent algorithm to compute the ODE parameters efficiently. We illustrate the numerical advantages of our approach using data from realistic simulations and two task-related fMRI experiments. Compared with various effective connectivity methods, our method achieves higher estimation accuracy while improving the computational speed by from tens to thousands of times. Though our method is developed for task-related fMRI, we also demonstrate the potential applicability of our method (with a simple modification) to resting-state fMRI, by analyzing both simulated and real data from medium-sized networks.

Correlating Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Connectivity by Independent Component Analysis-Based Epileptogenic Zones with Intracranial Electroencephalogram Localized Seizure Onset Zones and Surgical Outcomes in Prospective Pediatric Intractable Epilepsy Study	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; functional connectivity; independent component analysis; intraoperative electrocorticography; resting-state functional MRI		The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the agreement between the epileptogenic zone(s) (EZ) localization by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and the seizure onset zone(s) (SOZ) identified by intracranial electroencephalogram (ic-EEG) using novel differentiating and ranking criteria of rs-fMRI abnormal independent components (ICs) in a large consecutive heterogeneous pediatric intractable epilepsy population without an a priori alternate modality informing EZ localization or prior declaration of total SOZ number. The EZ determination criteria were developed by using independent component analysis (ICA) on rs-fMRI in an initial cohort of 350 pediatric patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery over a 3-year period. Subsequently, these rs-fMRI EZ criteria were applied prospectively to an evaluation cohort of 40 patients who underwent ic-EEG for SOZ identification. Thirty-seven of these patients had surgical resection/disconnection of the area believed to be the primary source of seizures. One-year seizure frequency rate was collected postoperatively. Among the total 40 patients evaluated, agreement between rs-fMRI EZ and ic-EEG SOZ was 90% (36/40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97). Of the 37 patients who had surgical destruction of the area believed to be the primary source of seizures, 27 (73%) rs-fMRI EZ could be classified as true positives, 7 (18%) false positives, and 2 (5%) false negatives. Sensitivity of rs-fMRI EZ was 93% (95% CI 78-98%) with a positive predictive value of 79% (95% CI, 63-89%). In those with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy, agreement between rs-fMRI EZ and ic-EEG SOZ was 89% (8/9; 95% CI, 0.52-99), with no statistically significant difference between the agreement in the cryptogenic and symptomatic localization-related epilepsy subgroups. Two children with negative ic-EEG had removal of the rs-fMRI EZ and were seizure free 1 year postoperatively. Of the 33 patients where at least 1 rs-fMRI EZ agreed with the ic-EEG SOZ, 24% had at least 1 additional rs-fMRI EZ outside the resection area. Of these patients with un-resected rs-fMRI EZ, 75% continued to have seizures 1 year later. Conversely, among 75% of patients in whom rs-fMRI agreed with ic-EEG SOZ and had no anatomically separate rs-fMRI EZ, only 24% continued to have seizures 1 year later. This relationship between extraneous rs-fMRI EZ and seizure outcome was statistically significant (p=0.01). rs-fMRI EZ surgical destruction showed significant association with postoperative seizure outcome. The pediatric population with intractable epilepsy studied prospectively provides evidence for use of resting-state ICA ranking criteria, to identify rs-fMRI EZ, as developed by the lead author (V.L.B.). This is a high yield test in this population, because no seizure nor particular interictal epilepiform activity needs to occur during the study. Thus, rs-fMRI EZ detected by this technique are potentially informative for epilepsy surgery evaluation and planning in this population. Independent of other brain function testing modalities, such as simultaneous EEG-fMRI or electrical source imaging, contextual ranking of abnormal ICs of rs-fMRI localized EZs correlated with the gold standard of SOZ localization, ic-EEG, across the broad range of pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates, including those with cryptogenic epilepsy.

Memory can be divided into two categories, i.e., long term memory and short term memory (STM). STM or working memory (WM) stores information for a short span of time and it is used for information manipulations and fast response activities. WM is generally involved in the higher cognitive functions of the brain. Different studies have been carried out by researchers to understand the WM process. Most of these studies were based on neuroimaging modalities like fMRI, EEG, MEG etc., which use standalone processes. Each neuroimaging modality has some pros and cons. For example, EEG gives high temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution. On the other hand, the fMRI results have a high spatial resolution but poor temporal resolution. For a more in depth understanding and insight of what is happening inside the human brain during the WM process or during cognitive tasks, high spatial as well as high temporal resolution is desirable. Over the past decade, researchers have been working to combine different modalities to achieve a high spatial and temporal resolution at the same time. Developments of MRI compatible EEG equipment in recent times have enabled researchers to combine EEG-fMRI successfully. The research publications in simultaneous EEG-fMRI have been increasing tremendously. This review is focused on the WM research involving simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquisition and analysis. We have covered the simultaneous EEG-fMRI application in WM and data processing. Also, it adds to potential fusion methods which can be used for simultaneous EEG-fMRI for WM and cognitive tasks.

The statistical power of fMRI group studies is significantly hampered by high inter-subject variance due to differences in baseline vascular physiology. Several methods have been proposed to account for physiological vascularization differences between subjects and hence improve the sensitivity in group studies. However, these methods require the acquisition of additional reference scans (such as a full resting-state fMRI session or ASL-based calibrated BOLD). We present a vascular autorescaling (VasA) method, which does not require any additional reference scans. VasA is based on the observation that slow oscillations (<0.1 Hz) in arterial blood CO2 levels occur naturally due to changes in respiration patterns. These oscillations yield fMRI signal changes whose amplitudes reflect the blood oxygenation levels and underlying local vascularization and vascular responsivity. VasA estimates proxies of the amplitude of these CO2-driven oscillations directly from the residuals of task-related fMRI data without the need for reference scans. The estimates are used to scale the amplitude of task-related fMRI responses, to account for vascular differences. The VasA maps compared well to cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps and cerebral blood volume maps based on vascular space occupancy (VASO) measurements in four volunteers, speaking to the physiological vascular basis of VasA. VasA was validated in a wide variety of tasks in 138 volunteers. VasA increased t-scores by up to 30% in specific brain areas such as the visual cortex. The number of activated voxels was increased by up to 200% in brain areas such as the orbital frontal cortex while still controlling the nominal false-positive rate. VasA fMRI outperformed previously proposed rescaling approaches based on resting-state fMRI data and can be readily applied to any task-related fMRI data set, even retrospectively.

Although this limitation stems in part from the neuro-vascular nature of the fMRI signal, it also reflects particular methodological decisions in the fMRI data analysis pathway. Here we show that the signal detection accuracy of fMRI is affected by the specific way in which whole-brain volumes are created from individually acquired brain slices, and by the method of statistically extracting signals from the sampled data. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework for fMRI data analysis. The new framework creates whole-brain volumes from individual brain slices that are all acquired at the same point in time relative to a presented stimulus. These whole-brain volumes contain minimal temporal distortions, and are available at a high temporal resolution. In addition, statistical signal extraction occurred on the basis of a non-standard time point-by-time point approach. We evaluated the detection accuracy of the extracted signal in the standard and new framework with simulated and real-world fMRI data. The new slice-based data-analytic framework yields greatly improved signal detection accuracy of fMRI signals.

Enhanced control of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurophysiology with real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback training and working memory practice	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Working memory; Neurofeedback; fMRI	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR CORTEX; LEARNED REGULATION; SELF-REGULATION; REORGANIZATION; ACTIVATION; ROBUST; MODULATION; PLASTICITY; OPTIMIZATION	Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback can be used to train localized, conscious regulation of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. As a therapeutic technique, rt-fMRI neurofeedback reduces the symptoms of a variety of neurologic disorders. To date, few studies have investigated the use of self-regulation training using rt-fMRI neurofeedback to enhance cognitive performance. This work investigates the utility of rt-fMRI neurofeedback as a tool to enhance human cognition by training healthy individuals to consciously control activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). A cohort of 18 healthy participants in the experimental group underwent rt-fMRI neurofeedback from the left DLPFC in five training sessions across two weeks while 7 participants in the control group underwent similar training outside the MRI and without rt-fMRI neurofeedback. Working memory (WM) performance was evaluated on two testing days separated by the five rt-fMRI neurofeedback sessions using two computerized tests. We investigated the ability to control the BOLD signal across training sessions and WM performance across the two testing days. The group with rt-fMRI neurofeedback demonstrated a significant increase in the ability to self-regulate the BOLD signal in the left DLPFC across sessions. WM performance showed differential improvement between testing days one and two across the groups with the highest increases observed in the rt-fMRI neurofeedback group. These results provide evidence that individuals can quickly gain the ability to consciously control the left DLPFC, and this training results in improvements of WM performance beyond that of training alone.

Integration of resting state functional MRI into clinical practice - A large single institution experience	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFAULT MODE; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; MOTION ARTIFACT; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORKS; CORTEX; RESECTION; MOTOR; ORGANIZATION	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool for pre-surgical evaluation of eloquent cortex. Classic task-based paradigms require patient participation and individual imaging sequence acquisitions for each functional domain that is being assessed. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), however, enables functional localization without patient participation and can evaluate numerous functional domains with a single imaging session. To date, post-processing of this resting state data has been resource intensive, which limits its widespread application for routine clinical use. Through a novel automated algorithm and advanced imaging IT structure, we report the clinical application and the large-scale integration of rs-fMRI into routine neurosurgical practice. One hundred and ninety one consecutive patients underwent a 3T rs-fMRI, 83 of whom also underwent both motor and language task-based fMRI. Data were processed using a novel, automated, multi-layer perceptron algorithm and integrated into stereotactic navigation using a streamlined IT imaging pipeline. One hundred eighty-five studies were performed for intracranial neoplasm, 14 for refractory epilepsy and 33 for vascular malformations or other neurological disorders. Failure rate of rs-fMRI of 13% was significantly better than that for task-based fMRI (38.5%,) (p<0.001). In conclusion, at Washington University in St. Louis, rs-fMRI has become an integral part of standard imaging for neurosurgical planning. Resting state fMRI can be used in all patients, and due to its lower failure rate than task-based fMRI, it is useful for patients who are unable to cooperate with task-based studies.

J	DSouza, AM; Abidin, AZ; Leistritz, L; Wismüller, A				DSouza, Adora M.; Abidin, Anas Z.; Leistritz, Lutz; Wismueller, Axel			Exploring connectivity with large-scale Granger causality on resting-state functional MRI	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Resting-state fMRI; Functional connectivity; Network recovery; Granger causality; Principal component analysis; Independent component analysis; Multivariate analysis; Non-metric clustering; Louvain method; Hemodynamic response; Repetition time	TIME-SERIES; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS; MODELS; FLOW	Background: Large-scale Granger causality (IsGC) is a recently developed, resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity analysis approach that estimates multivariate voxel-resolution connectivity. Unlike most commonly used multivariate approaches, which establish coarse-resolution connectivity by aggregating voxel time-series avoiding an underdetermined problem, IsGC estimates voxel-resolution, fine-grained connectivity by incorporating an embedded dimension reduction. New method: We investigate application of IsGC on realistic fMRI simulations, modeling smoothing of neuronal activity by the hemodynamic response function and repetition time (TR), and empirical resting state fMRI data. Subsequently, functional subnetworks are extracted from IsGC connectivity measures for both datasets and validated quantitatively. We also provide guidelines to select IsGC free parameters. Results: Results indicate that IsGC reliably recovers underlying network structure with area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 at TR = 1.5 s for a 10-min session of fMRI simulations. Furthermore, subnetworks of closely interacting modules are recovered from the aforementioned IsGC networks. Results on empirical resting-state fMRI data demonstrate recovery of visual and motor cortex in close agreement with spatial maps obtained from (i) visuo-motor fMRI stimulation task-sequence (Accuracy = 0.76) and (ii) independent component analysis (ICA) of resting-state fMRI (Accuracy = 0.86). Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with conventional Granger causality approach (AUC = 0.75), IsGC produces better network recovery on fMRI simulations. Furthermore, it cannot recover functional subnetworks from empirical fMRI data, since quantifying voxel-resolution connectivity is not possible as consequence of encountering an underdetermined problem. Conclusions: Functional network recovery from fMRI data suggests that IsGC gives useful insight into connectivity patterns from resting-state fMRI at a multivariate voxel-resolution.

Systematic Review of fMRI Compatible Devices: Design and Testing Criteria	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						fMRI; Compatibility; Safety; Mechatronic devices	FORCE SENSING SYSTEM; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; HAPTIC INTERFACE; MAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY; TACTILE STIMULATOR; ULTRASONIC MOTOR; MR-COMPATIBILITY; INVESTIGATE; ACTIVATION; FEEDBACK	Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is at present one of the most used methodologies for functional brain exploration, both in clinical and research settings. fMRI can noninvasively measure neural activity by using specific experimental paradigms. Often, these paradigms require the stimulation of the subject to perform sensorimotor tasks: in the past, the stimuli have been administered manually for investigating fundamental aspects of tactile perception and somatosensory processing. Nowadays, the use of mechatronic devices to stimulate the subject during fMRI studies is growing, also to assure reproducibility, control, and monitoring of task performances. For these reasons, researchers are interested in designing interfaces to be used inside the MRI environment during fMRI studies. For the design of every new device safety and compatibility constraints, imposed by the presence of high static magnetic field, switching magnetic gradients and radiofrequency electromagnetic pulses, must be satisfied. Moreover, it should be considered that functional imaging sequences are even more sensitive to perturbations of the magnetic field than MRI standard diagnostic sequences. Despite several existing devices for use in fMRI studies, an extensive review is still lacking. Our survey aims to introduce into the challenges imposed on the development of fMRI-compatible devices. The current state of the art of compatible devices in fMRI will be presented, pointing out the functionalities and peculiarities of various kinds of device. A particular emphasis will be placed on the tests for the evaluation of fMRI compatibility. This review will be useful both for designers of devices to be used in fMRI studies and for neuroscientists that are having to design fMRI experimental paradigm, and therefore require an overview of existing instruments, but also a knowledge of the benefits and criticism arising from their use.

New method: Centers of gravity (CoGs) and response maxima were measured with blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) fMRI during motor tasks against nTMS CoGs and response maxima, which were mapped with motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and silent periods (SPs). Results: No differences in motor representations (CoGs and response maxima) were observed in lateral medial direction (p = 0.265). fMRI methods localized the motor representation more posterior than nTMS (p < 0.001). This was not affected by the BOLD fMRI motor task (p >0.999) nor nTMS response type (p > 0.999). ASL fMRI maxima did not differ from the nTMS nor BOLD fMRI CoGs (p >= 0.070), but the ASL CoG was deeper in comparison to other methods (p <= 0.042). The BOLD fMRI motor task did not influence the depth of the motor representation (p >= 0.745). The median Euclidean distances between the nTMS and fMRI motor representations varied between 7.7 mm and 14.5 mm and did not differ between the methods (F <= 1.23, p >= 0.318). Comparison with existing methods: The relationship between fMRI and nTMS mapped excitatory (MEP) and inhibitory (SP) responses, and whether the choice of motor task affects this relationship, have not been studied before. Conclusions: The congruence between fMRI and nTMS is good. The choice of nTMS motor response type nor BOLD fMRI motor task had no effect on this relationship. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These advances highlight the potential of high resolution fMRI to be a valuable tool to study the fundamental processing performed in cortical micro-circuits, and their interactions such as feedforward and feedback processes. Notably, because fMRI measures neuronal activity via hemodynamics, the ultimate resolution it affords depends on the spatial specificity of hemodynamics to neuronal activity at a detailed spatial scale, and by the evolution of this specificity over time. Several laminar (<= 1 mm spatial resolution) fMRI studies have examined spatial characteristics of the measured hemodynamic signals across cortical depth, in light of understanding or improving the spatial specificity of laminar fMRI. Few studies have examined temporal features of the hemodynamic response across cortical depth. Temporal features of the hemodynamic response offer an additional means to improve the specificity of fMRI, and could help target neuronal processes and neurovascular coupling relationships across laminae, for example by differences in the onset times of the response across cortical depth. In this review, we discuss factors that affect the timing of neuronal and hemodynamic responses across laminae, touching on the neuronal laminar organization, and focusing on the laminar vascular organization. We provide an overview of hemodynamics across the cortical vascular tree based on optical imaging studies, and review temporal aspects of hemodynamics that have been examined across cortical depth in high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI studies. Last, we discuss the limits and potential of high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI to study laminar neurovascular coupling and neuronal processes.	[Petridou, Natalia; Siero, Jeroen C.

Consequently, S2-SSFP fMRI has been suggested as an alternative to mitigate these problems. Nevertheless, no accurate analysis has been performed thus far to evaluate spatial specificity of this technique. To study spatial specificity, we performed Monte Carlo simulations for evaluating the micro-vasculature contribution in functional contrast along with vessel size sensitivity estimations for a range of relevant imaging parameters. Results showed a spatial specificity at the level of SE fMRI. Simulations further revealed that similar to SE fMRI, an effective echo time (TE) close to the tissue T2 maximizes the microvasculature contribution in the obtained contrast. The amount of this contribution, however, showed a slight decrease at ultra -high fields compared to SE fMRI. As for vessel size sensitivity, simulations presented a pattern for S2-SSFP similar to SE fMRI but with a minor shift toward larger vessels. These results are in general agreement with reported experimental studies. Our findings also suggest that the effect of older pathways, rather than primary SE pathway, might be responsible for the observed discrepancies between S2 and SE. Based on this study, provided that optimum experimental parameters are used, S2, with its desirable micro-vasculature contribution and high sensitivity to small vessels, is a promising low SAR approach to replace SE fMRI in high field.

Multimodal methods have sought to combine the high temporal resolution of EEG with the spatial precision of fMRI, but the complexity of this approach is currently in need of improvement. The protocol presented here describes the recently developed spatiotemporal fMRI-constrained EEG source imaging method, which seeks to rectify source biases and improve EEG-fMRI source localization through the dynamic recruitment of fMRI sub-regions. The process begins with the collection of multimodal data from concurrent EEG and fMRI scans, the generation of 3D cortical models, and independent EEG and fMRI processing. The processed fMRI activation maps are then split into multiple priors, according to their location and surrounding area. These are taken as priors in a two-level hierarchical Bayesian algorithm for EEG source localization. For each window of interest (defined by the operator), specific segments of the fMRI activation map will be identified as active to optimize a parameter known as model evidence. These will be used as soft constraints on the identified cortical activity, increasing the specificity of the multimodal imaging method by reducing cross-talk and avoiding erroneous activity in other conditionally active fMRI regions. The method generates cortical maps of activity and time-courses, which may be taken as final results, or used as a basis for further analyses (analyses of correlation, causation, etc.) While the method is somewhat limited by its modalities (it will not find EEG-invisible sources), it is broadly compatible with most major processing software, and is suitable for most neuroimaging studies.

Ten Key Insights into the Use of Spinal Cord fMRI	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Review						spinal cord; fMRI; human; animal; methods; analysis; review	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VOLUME-WEIGHTED FMRI; BRAIN-STEM; THERMAL-STIMULATION; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SENSORY STIMULATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; ALPHA-CHLORALOSE	A comprehensive review of the literature-to-date on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the spinal cord is presented. Spinal fMRI has been shown, over more than two decades of work, to be a reliable tool for detecting neural activity. We discuss 10 key points regarding the history, development, methods, and applications of spinal fMRI. Animal models have served a key purpose for the development of spinal fMRI protocols and for experimental spinal cord injury studies. Applications of spinal fMRI span from animal models across healthy and patient populations in humans using both task-based and resting-state paradigms. The literature also demonstrates clear trends in study design and acquisition methods, as the majority of studies follow a task-based, block design paradigm, and utilize variations of single-shot fast spin-echo imaging methods. We, therefore, discuss the similarities and differences of these to resting-state fMRI and gradient-echo EPI protocols. Although it is newly emerging, complex connectivity and network analysis is not only possible, but has also been shown to be reliable and reproducible in the spinal cord for both task-based and resting-state studies. Despite the technical challenges associated with spinal fMRI, this review identifies reliable solutions that have been developed to overcome these challenges.

We combined submillimeter fMRI with microelectrode recordings to localize the deafferented digit regions in areas 3b and S2 by mapping tactile stimulus-evoked fMRI activations before and after cervical dorsal column lesion in each male monkey. An average afferent disruption of 97% significantly reduced fMRI, local field potential (LFP), and spike responses to stimuli in both areas. Analysis of resting-state fMRI signal correlation, LFP coherence, and spike cross-correlation revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between deafferented areas 3b and S2. The degrees of reductions in stimulus responsiveness and FC after deafferentation differed across fMRI, LFP, and spiking signals. The reduction of FC was much weaker than that of stimulus-evoked responses. Whereas the largest stimulus-evoked signal drop (similar to 80%) was observed in LFP signals, the greatest FC reduction was detected in the spiking activity (similar to 30%). fMRI signals showed mild reductions in stimulus responsiveness (similar to 25%) and FC (similar to 20%). The overall deafferentation-induced changes were quite similar in areas 3b and S2 across signals. Here we demonstrated that FC strength between areas 3b and S2 was much weakened by dorsal column lesion, and stimulus response reduction and FC disruption in fMRI covary with those of LFP and spiking signals in deafferented areas 3b and S2. These findings have important implications for fMRI studies aiming to probe FC alterations in pathological conditions involving deafferentation in humans.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the local functional activity in healthy controls (HC) subjects and left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy-hippocampal sclerosis patients, after a SD, by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and EEG. Materials and methods: We enrolled 22 healthy controls and 34 patients with a diagnosis of left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy-hippocampal sclerosis. Each participant underwent two examinations separately: an fMRI study using 3 T MRI to detect spontaneous activity during the RS-fMRI and an EEG. Results: The SD-EEG results showed the presence of epileptiform discharges predominantly in left fronto-centro-temporal areas. fMRI findings if compared to HC showed an increase of functional activity in some areas. Discussion: We showed that SD-EEG study confirmed a high specificity to assess a specific diagnosis. Therefore, the decrease of activity observed in DMN could be explain by a different amount of sleep/awake time during fMRI recording in the two groups or the interictal activity during fMRI acquisition. Our study highlighted alterated functional activity in SD cortical areas of epileptic patients if compared to HC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the DL-based methods for fMRI analysis proposed to date do not naturally extend to multi-subject analysis. In this paper, we propose a DL algorithm for multi subject fMRI data analysis which is derived using a hybrid (temporal and spatial) concatenation scheme. It differs from existing DL methods in both its sparse coding and dictionary update stages. It has the advantage of learning a dictionary common to all subjects as well as a set of subject-specific dictionaries, as a result, it is able to generate both group-level spatial activation maps as well as group-level temporal dynamics, which are particularly attractive for task-based fMRI studies. In addition, by simultaneously learning multiple sub-specific dictionaries, it also provides us with unique sub-specific features as well. Performance of the proposed DL method is illustrated using simulated and real fMRI datasets. The results show that it can successfully extract common as well as sub-specific latent components.

Recent work suggests a contribution from the sympathetic vascular innervation, which may affect the fMRI signal through its putative and poorly understood role in cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation. By analyzing fMRI and (electro-) physiological signals concurrently acquired during sleep, we found that widespread fMRI signal changes often co-occur with electroencephalography (EEG) K-complexes, signatures of sub-cortical arousal, and episodic drops in finger skin vascular tone; phenomena that have been associated with intermittent sympathetic activity. These findings support the notion that the extrinsic sympathetic innervation of the cerebral vasculature contributes to CBF regulation and the fMRI signal. Accounting for this mechanism could help separate systemic from local signal contributions and improve interpretation of fMRI studies.

Brain imaging by functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used to examine brain function related to human cognition/behavior. However, few aspects of cognition/behavior of individuals or experimental groups can be examined through task-based fMRI. Recently, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals have been shown to represent functional infrastructure in the brain that is highly involved in processing information related to cognition/behavior. Using rs-fMRI may allow diverse information about the brain through a single MRI scan to be obtained, as rs-fMRI does not require stimulus tasks. In this study, we attempted to identify a set of functional networks representing cognition/behavior that are related to a wide variety of human characteristics and to evaluate these characteristics using rs-fMRI data. If possible, these findings would support the potential of rs-fMRI to provide diverse information about the brain. We used resting-state fMRI and a set of 130 psychometric parameters that cover most human characteristics, including those related to intelligence and emotional quotients and social ability/skill. We identified 163 brain regions by VBM analysis using regression analysis with 130 psychometric parameters. Next, using a 163 x 163 correlation matrix, we identified functional networks related to 111 of the 130 psychometric parameters. Finally, we made an 8-class support vector machine classifiers corresponding to these 111 functional networks. Our results demonstrate that rs-fMRI signals contain intrinsic information about brain function related to cognition/behaviors and that this set of 111 networks/classifiers can be used to comprehensively evaluate human characteristics.

Partial resection of presurgical fMRI activation is associated with a postsurgical loss of language function after frontal lobe epilepsy surgery	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Frontal lobe epilepsy; epilepsy surgery; language; electrocortical stimulation; fMRI	DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION; HIGH GAMMA ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; WADA TEST; BRAIN-TUMORS; BROCAS AREA; LOCALIZATION; CORTEX; MOTOR; NEURONAVIGATION; LATERALIZATION	We describe five patients with frontal lobe epilepsy who underwent electrocortical stimulation (ES) for language localization and language functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to epilepsy surgery. Six months after surgery, three patients suffered from a drop of verbal fluency. In all of them, frontal areas with presurgical language fMRI activity were resected. Our results suggest that resection in regions of areas with presurgical fMRI activation is not without risk for a postsurgical loss of function, even when ES results were negative for language function in these areas. Using fMRI activations might be specifically helpful to plan the resection when ES delivered inconclusive results.

Previously, the fMRI signal analysis has been conducted using empirical mean curve decomposition (EMCD) model and voxel selection on raw fMRI signal. The erstwhile methodology loses frequency component, while the latter methodology suffers from signal redundancy. Both challenges are addressed by our methodology in which the frequency component is considered by decomposing the raw fMRI signal using geometric mean rather than arithmetic mean and the voxels are selected from EMCD signal using GMCD components, rather than raw fMRI signal. The proposed methodologies are adopted for predicting the neural response. Experimentations are conducted in the openly available fMRI data of six subjects, and comparisons are made with existing decomposition models and voxel selection frameworks. Subsequently, the effect of degree of selected voxels and the selection constraints are analyzed. The comparative results and the analysis demonstrate the superiority and the reliability of the proposed methodology.

Decoding Task-Related Functional Brain Imaging Data to Identify Developmental Disorders: The Case of Congenital Amusia	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); rs-fMRI; sMRI; task-based fMRI; tone deafness; diagnostic; brain-based biomarkers	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; DEFAULT MODE; PITCH; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; DISCRIMINATION; NETWORK; REGIONS	Machine learning classification techniques are frequently applied to structural and resting-state fMRI data to identify brain-based biomarkers for developmental disorders. However, task-related fMRI has rarely been used as a diagnostic tool. Here, we used structural MRI, resting-state connectivity and task-based fMRI data to detect congenital amusia, a pitch-specific developmental disorder. All approaches discriminated amusics from controls in meaningful brain networks at similar levels of accuracy. Interestingly, the classifier outcome was specific to deficit-related neural circuits, as the group classification failed for fMRI data acquired during a verbal task for which amusics were unimpaired. Most importantly, classifier outputs of task-related fMRI data predicted individual behavioral performance on an independent pitch-based task, while this relationship was not observed for structural or resting-state data. These results suggest that task-related imaging data can potentially be used as a powerful diagnostic tool to identify developmental disorders as they allow for the prediction of symptom severity.

However, the mechanisms underlying these side effects, and why certain brain anatomies are more affected still remain poorly understood. Advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods, such as pharmaco-fMRI, can investigate medication-related effects on brain activities using task and resting state fMRI and showing reproducible activation and deactivation patterns. This methodological approach has been used successfully to complement neuropsychological studies of AEDs. Here we review pharmaco-fMRI studies in people with epilepsy targeting the most-widely prescribed AEDs. Pharmco-fMRI has advanced our understanding of the impact of AEDs on specific brain networks and thus may provide potential biomarkers to move beyond the current "trial and error" approach when commencing anti-epileptic medication.

Nevertheless, most studies use only the magnitude signals and thus discard half of the data that could potentially contain important information. Methods that make use of complex-valued fMRI (CV-fMRI) data have been shown to lead to superior power in detecting active voxels when compared to magnitude-only methods, particularly for small signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We present a new Bayesian variable selection approach for detecting brain activation at the voxel level from CV-fMRI data. We develop models with complex-valued spike-and-slab priors on the activation parameters that are able to combine the magnitude and phase information. We present a complex-valued EM variable selection algorithm that leads to fast detection at the voxel level in CV-fMRI slices and also consider full posterior inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Model performance is illustrated through extensive simulation studies, including the analysis of physically based simulated CV-fMRI slices. Finally, we use the complex-valued Bayesian approach to detect active voxels in human CV-fMRI from a healthy individual who performed unilateral finger tapping in a designed experiment. The proposed approach leads to improved detection of activation in the expected motor-related brain regions and produces fewer false positive results than other methods for CV-fMRI.

J	Ai, L; Xiong, JH				Ai, Leo; Xiong, Jinhu			Temporal-spatial mean-shift clustering analysis to improve functional MRI activation detection	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						fMRI; fMRI analysis; Clustering; Mean-shift	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; GRADIENT; NA-23; P-31	Cluster analysis (CA) is often used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis to improve detection of functional activations. Commonly used clustering techniques typically only consider spatial information of a statistical parametric image (SPI) in their calculations. This study examines incorporating the temporal characteristics of acquired fMRI data with mean-shift clustering (MSC) for fMRI analysis to enhance activation detections. Simulated data and real fMRI data was used to compare the commonly used cluster analysis with MSC using a feature space containing temporal characteristics. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves show that improvements in low contrast to noise scenarios using MSC over CA and our previous MSC technique at all tested simulated activation sizes. The proposed MSC technique with a feature space using both temporal and spatial data characteristics shows improved activation detection for both simulated and real Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data (approximately 60% increase). The proposed techniques are useful in techniques that inherently have low contrast to noise ratios, such as non-proton imaging or high resolution BOLD fMRI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, less is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spontaneous activity of the brain. By examining the characteristics of both rs-fMRI and vascular time lag that was measured using dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion weighted imaging, the present study identifies several structured propagation of the rs-fMRI signal as putative neural streams. Temporal shift of both rs-fMRI and perfusion imaging data in each voxel compared with the averaged whole-brain signal was computed using cross-correlation analysis. In contrast to the uniformity of the vascular time lag across subjects, whole-brain rs-fMRI time lag was estimated to be composed of three independent components. After regression of vascular time lag, independent component analysis was applied to rs-fMRI data. The putative neural streams showed slow propagation of the signal from task-positive regions to main nodes of the default mode network, which may represent a mode of transmission underlying the interactions among the resting-state networks.

Physiological noise originating from the cardiac and respiration signal is the dominant interference in human rs-fMRI and extensive efforts have been made to reduce these artifacts from the human data. In animal fMRI studies, physiological noise sources including the respiratory and cardiorespiratory artifacts to the rs-fMRI signal fluctuation have typically been less investigated. In this article, we demonstrate evidence of aliasing effects into the low-frequency rs-fMRI signal fluctuation mainly due to respiration-induced BO offsets in anesthetized rats. This aliased signal was examined by systematically altering the fMRI sampling rate, i.e., the time of repetition (TR), in free-breathing conditions and by adjusting the rate of ventilation. Anesthetized rats under ventilation showed a significantly narrower frequency bandwidth of the aliasing effect than free-breathing animals. It was found that the aliasing effect could be further reduced in ventilated animals with a muscle relaxant. This work elucidates the respiration-related aliasing effects on the rs-fMRI signal fluctuation from anesthetized rats, indicating non-negligible physiological noise needed to be taken care of in both awake and anesthetized animal rs-fMRI studies.

However, the DL-based methods for fMRI analysis proposed to date do not naturally extend to multisubject analysis. In this paper, we propose a DL algorithm for multisubject fMRI data analysis. Methods: The proposed algorithm [named shared and subject-specific dictionary learning (ShSSDL)] is derived based on a temporal concatenation, which is particularly attractive for the analysis of multisubject task-related fMRI datasets. It differs from existing DL algorithms in both its sparse coding and dictionary update stages and has the advantage of learning a dictionary shared by all subjects as well as a set of subject-specific dictionaries. Results: The performance of the proposed DL algorithm is illustrated using simulated and real fMRI datasets. The results show that it can successfully extract shared as well as subject-specific latent components. Conclusion: In addition to offering a new DL approach, when applied on multisubject fMRI data analysis, the proposed algorithm generates a group level as well as a set of subject-specific spatial maps. Significance: The proposed algorithm has the advantage of learning simultaneously multiple dictionaries providing us with a shared as well discriminative source of information about the analyzed fMRI datasets.

While it has mainly been used to explore the hemodynamic changes associated with epileptic spikes, this approach could also provide new insight into human cognition. However, the first step is to ensure that cognitive EEG components, that have lower amplitudes than epileptic spikes, can be appropriately detected under fMRI. We compared the high frequency activities (HFA, 50-150 Hz) elicited by a reading task in icEEG- only and subsequent icEEG-fMRI in the same patients (n = 3), implanted with depth electrodes. Comparable responses were obtained, with 71% of the recording sites that responded during the icEEG- only session also responding during the icEEG- fMRI session. For all the remaining sites, nearby clusters (distant of 7 mm or less) also demonstrated significant HFA increase during the icEEG- fMRI session. Significant HFA increases were also observable at the single-trial level in icEEG- fMRI recordings. Our results show that low-amplitude icEEG signal components such as cognitive-induced HFAs can be reliably recorded with simultaneous fMRI. This paves the way for the use of icEEG- fMRI to address various fundamental and clinical issues, notably the identification of the neural correlates of the BOLD signal.

CASE DESCRIPTION: Presurgical planning included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) localization of language, motor, and somatosensory processing. fMRI results for motor and somatosensory tasks revealed activation in perilesional regions near the surgical resection as well as deactivation in the tumor for the sensory task, suggesting decreased autoregulation in the region owing to the glioma. fMRI results showed left-hemisphere dominance for language and activation in perilesional regions for all 3 speech tasks (i.e., word reading, picture naming, and semantic questions). In addition, the results demonstrated that the high vascularity of the lesion altered the blood oxygen leveledependent function, resulting in false-positive and false-negative activation in the semantic questions and leg/foot rubbing task, respectively. Intraoperative direct cortical stimulation was conducted in the regions corresponding to fMRI activation while the patient performed motor, sensory, and language tasks and showed no loss of function. Follow-up fMRI revealed that there was no longer activation in the tumor or in perilesional regions, presumably owing to the resection of the vascularized tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of presurgical fMRI to inform the neurosurgical approach and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of fMRI data, especially in cases of malignant glioma, which can decrease autoregulation in surrounding regions, affecting fMRI blood oxygen leveledependent signal.

Clinical assessment takes advantage of objective parameters extracted by electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among others, to support clinical management of neurological diseases. The complementarity of these two tools can be now emphasized by the possibility of integrating the two technologies in a hybrid solution, allowing simultaneous acquisition of the two signals by the novel EEG-fMRI technology. This review will focus on simultaneous EEG-fMRI technology and related early studies, dealing about issues related to the acquisition and processing of simultaneous signals, and including critical discussion about clinical and technological perspectives.

Individual differences in reactivity to U threat have been measured in the laboratory with two methodologiesstartle eyeblink potentiation and fMRI. While startle and fMRI are purported to relate to each other, very little research exists on whether individual differences in one measure are associated with individual differences in another and, thus, whether startle and fMRI capture shared mechanisms. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate if and where in the brain measures of startle potentiation and fMRI BOLD signal correlate during response to U threat across two independent samples. Participants in both studies completed two threat anticipation tasks-once during collection of startle potentiation and once during fMRI. In Study 1 (n=43), the startle and fMRI tasks both used electric shock as the threat. As an extension, in Study 2 (n=38), the startle task used electric shock but the fMRI task used aversive images. Despite these methodological differences, greater startle potentiation to U threat was associated with greater dorsal anterior cingulate, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex reactivity to U threat in both samples. The findings suggest that startle and fMRI measures of responding to U threat overlap, and points toward an integrated brain-behavior profile of aberrant U threat responding.

Beyond physiology, laminar fMRI also offers an unprecedented opportunity to test influential theories of brain function. Specifically, hierarchical Bayesian theories of brain function, such as predictive coding, assign specific computational roles to different cortical layers. Combined with computational models, laminar fMRI offers a unique opportunity to test these proposals non-invasively in humans. This review provides a brief overview of predictive coding and related hierarchical Bayesian theories, summarises their predictions with regard to layered cortical computations, examines how these predictions could be tested by laminar fMRI, and considers methodological challenges. We conclude by discussing the potential of laminar fMRI for clinically useful computational assays of layer-specific information processing.	[Stephan, K. E.; Petzschner, F.

Four healthy female classical singers (mean age: 26 years) participated in the study. All subjects had normal vocal folds and vocal characteristics and showed supraglottic compression. The fMRI experiment was carried out using a block design paradigm. Brain activation during phonation and exhalation was analyzed using Brain Voyager software (Brain Innovation B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands). An fMRI data analysis showed a significant effect of phonation control in the bilateral pre/postcentral gyrus, and in the frontal, cingulate, superior and middle temporal gyrus, as well as in the parietal lobe, insula, lingual gyrus, cerebellum, thalamus and brainstem. These activation areas are consistent with previous reports using other fMRI protocols. In addition, a significant effect of phonation compared to exhalation control was found in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and the pre/postcentral gyrus. This fMRI pilot study allowed to detect a normal pattern of brain activity during phonation in healthy female singers with supraglottic compression using the proposed protocol. However, the pilot study detected problems with the experimental material/procedures that would necessitate refining the fMRI protocol. The phonation tasks were not capable to show brain activation difference between high-pitched and comfortable phonation. Further fMRI studies manipulating vocal parameters during phonation of the vowels /a/ and /i/ may elicit more distinctive hemodynamic response (HDR) activity patterns relative to voice modulation.

Presurgical Assessment of the Sensorimotor Cortex Using Resting-State fMRI	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; RANDOM-FIELD	Task-based approaches to functional localization of the motor cortex have limitations such as long scanning times and exclusion of patients with severe functional or neurologic disabilities and children. Resting-state fMRI may avoid these difficulties because patients do not perform any goal-directed tasks. Nineteen patients were prospectively evaluated by using task-based and resting-state fMRI to localize sensorimotor function. Independent component analyses were performed to generate spatial independent components reflecting functional brain networks or noise. The motor cortex was successfully and consistently identified by using resting-state fMRI. Hand, foot, and face regions were defined in a comparable fashion with task-based fMRI. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The functional characterization of the motor cortex is an important issue in the presurgical evaluation of brain lesions. fMRI noninvasively identifies motor areas while patients are asked to move different body parts. This task-based approach has some drawbacks in clinical settings: long scanning times and exclusion of patients with severe functional or neurologic disabilities and children. Resting-state fMRI can avoid these difficulties because patients do not perform any goal-directed tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with diverse brain pathologies were prospectively evaluated by using task-based and resting-state fMRI to localize sensorimotor function. Independent component analyses were performed to generate spatial independent components reflecting functional brain networks or noise. Three radiologists identified the motor components and 3 portions of the motor cortex corresponding to the hand, foot, and face representations. Selected motor independent components were compared with task-based fMRI activation maps resulting from movements of the corresponding body parts. RESULTS: The motor cortex was successfully and consistently identified by using resting-state fMRI by the 3 radiologists for all patients. When they subdivided the motor cortex into 3 segments, the sensitivities of resting-state and task-based fMRI were comparable. Moreover, we report a good spatial correspondence with the task-based fMRI activity estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Resting-state fMRI can reliably image sensorimotor function in a clinical preoperative routine. It is a promising opportunity for presurgical localization of sensorimotor function and has the potential to benefit a large number of patients affected by a wide range of pathologies.	[Schneider, F.

However, acquiring and interpreting ECS results can sometimes be challenging. This retrospective study assesses whether intraoperative availability of fMRI impacted surgical decision-making when ECS was problematic or unobtainable. METHODS Records were reviewed for 191 patients who underwent presurgical fMRI with fMRI loaded into the neuronavigation system. Four patients were excluded as a bur-hole biopsy was performed. Imaging was acquired at 3 Tesla and analyzed using the general linear model with significantly activated pixels determined via individually determined thresholds. fMRI maps were displayed intraoperatively via commercial neuronavigation systems. RESULTS Seventy-one cases were planned ECS; however, 18 (25.35%) of these procedures were either not attempted or aborted/limited due to: seizure (10), patient difficulty cooperating with the ECS mapping (4), scarring/limited dural opening (3), or dural bleeding (1). In all aborted/limited ECS cases, the surgeon continued surgery using fMRI to guide surgical decision-making. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative deficits between cases with completed ECS and those with limited/aborted ECS. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative fMRI allowed for continuation of surgery in over one-fourth of patients in which planned ECS was incomplete or impossible, without a significantly different incidence of postoperative deficits compared to the patients with completed ECS. This demonstrates additional value of fMRI beyond presurgical planning, as fMRI data served as a backup method to ECS.

We hypothesized that calculating the rs-fMRI features, for example, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in individual space, before the spatial normalization (referred to as "Postnorm") can be an improvement to avoid artifacts and increase the results' reliability. We utilized two datasets: (1) simulated images where temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is kept a constant and (2) an empirical fMRI dataset with 50 healthy young subjects. For simulated images, the tSNR is constant as generated in individual space but increased after Prenorm and intersubject variability of tSNR was induced. In contrast, tSNR was kept constant after Postnorm. Consistently, for empirical images, higher tSNR, ReHo, and FC (default mode network, seed in precuneus) and lower ALFF were found after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Coefficient of variability of tSNR and ALFF was higher after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Moreover, the significant correlation was found between simulated tSNR after Prenorm and empirical tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo after Prenorm, indicating algorithmic variation in empirical rs-fMRI features. Furthermore, comparing to Prenorm, ALFF and ReHo showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients between two serial scans after Postnorm. Our results indicated that Prenorm may induce algorithmic intersubject variability on tSNR and reduce its reliability, which also significantly affected ALFF and ReHo. We suggest using Postnorm instead of Prenorm for future rs-fMRI studies using ALFF/ReHo.

This information is difficult to obtain directly in the human brain, and is instead typically inferred from resting-state fMRI. New method: Here, we demonstrate the safety and scientific promise of a novel and complementary approach: concurrent electrical stimulation and fMRI (es-fMRI) at 3 T in awake neurosurgical patients with implanted depth electrodes. Results: We document the results of safety testing, actual experimental setup, and stimulation parameters, that safely and reliably evoke activation in distal structures through stimulation of amygdala, cingulate, or prefrontal cortex. We compare connectivity inferred from the evoked patterns of activation with that estimated from standard resting-state fMRI in the same patients: while connectivity patterns obtained with each approach are correlated, each method produces unique results. Response patterns were stable over the course of 11 min of es-fMRI runs. Comparison with existing method: es-fMRI in awake humans yields unique information about effective connectivity, complementing resting-state fMRI. Although our stimulations were below the level of inducing any apparent behavioral or perceptual effects, a next step would be to use es-fMRI to modulate task performances. This would reveal the acute network-level changes induced by the stimulation that mediate the behavioral and cognitive effects seen with brain stimulation. Conclusions: es-fMRI provides a novel and safe approach for mapping effective connectivity in the human brain in a clinical setting, and will inform treatments for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders that use deep brain stimulation.

However, the resting state paradigm allows an unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by future studies.

However, high spatiotemporal resolution SE-fMRI with large slice-coverage is challenging as SE-fMRI requires a long echo time to generate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, leading to long repetition times. The aim of this work is to develop an acquisition method that enhances the slice-coverage of SE-fMRI at high spatiotemporal resolution. Theory and Methods An acquisition scheme was developed entitled multisection excitation by simultaneous spin-echo interleaving (MESSI) with complex-encoded generalized slice dithered enhanced resolution (cgSlider). MESSI uses the dead-time during the long echo time by interleaving the excitation and readout of 2 slices to enable 2x slice-acceleration, while cgSlider uses the stable temporal background phase in SE-fMRI to encode/decode 2 adjacent slices simultaneously with a "phase-constrained" reconstruction method. The proposed cgSlider-MESSI was also combined with simultaneous multislice (SMS) to achieve further slice-acceleration. This combined approach was used to achieve 1.5-mm isotropic whole-brain SE-fMRI with a temporal resolution of 1.5 s and was evaluated using sensory stimulation and breath-hold tasks at 3T. Results Compared with conventional SE-SMS, cgSlider-MESSI-SMS provides 4-fold increase in slice-coverage for the same repetition time, with comparable temporal signal-to-noise ratio. Corresponding fMRI activation from cgSlider-MESSI-SMS for both fMRI tasks were consistent with those from conventional SE-SMS. Overall, cgSlider-MESSI-SMS achieved a 32x encoding-acceleration by combining R-inplane x MB x cgSlider x MESSI = 4 x 2 x 2 x 2. Conclusion High-quality, high-resolution whole-brain SE-fMRI was acquired at a short repetition time using cgSlider-MESSI-SMS. This method should be beneficial for high spatiotemporal resolution SE-fMRI studies requiring whole-brain coverage.

Emotional decision is a part of hot executive function and contains emotion and logic elements. As a kind of important social adaptation ability, more and more attention has been paid in recent years. Objective: Gambling task can be well performed in the study of emotional decision. As fMRI researches focused on gambling task show not completely consistent brain activation regions, this study adopted EEG-fMRI fusion technology to reveal brain neural activity related with feedback stimuli. Methods: In this study, an EEG-informed fMRI analysis was applied to process simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. First, relative power-spectrum analysis and K-means clustering method were performed separately to extract EEG-fMRI features. Then, Generalized linear models were structured using fMRI data and using different EEG features as regressors. Results: The results showed that in the win versus loss stimuli, the activated regions almost covered the caudate, the ventral striatum (VS), the orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and the cingulate. Wide activation areas associated with reward and punishment were revealed by the EEG-fMRI integration analysis than the conventional fMRI results, such as the posterior cingulate and the OFC. The VS and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were found when EEG power features were performed as regressors of GLM compared with results entering the amplitudes of feedbacK-related negativity (FRN) as regressors. Furthermore, the brain region activation intensity was the strongest when theta-band power was used as a regressor compared with the other two fusion results. Conclusions: The EEG-based fMRI analysis can more accurately depict the whole-brain activation map and analyze emotional decision problems.

Effects of spatial fMRI resolution on the classification of naturalistic movies	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; High-resolution; High-field; 7T; Multivariate pattern analysis; MVPA; Naturalistic stimuli; Movies; Eye tracking	MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; VENTRAL TEMPORAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; HIGH-FIELD FMRI; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; 7 T; REPRESENTATIONAL SPACES; BOLD FMRI; ORIENTATION	Studies involving multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of BOLD fMRI data generally attribute the success of the information-theoretic approach to BOLD signal contrast on the fine spatial scale of millimeters facilitating the classification or decoding of perceptual stimuli. However, to date MVPA studies that have actually explored fMRI resolutions at less than 2 mm voxel size are rare and limited to small sets of unnatural stimuli (like visual gratings) as well as specific sub-regions of the brain, notably the primary somatosensory cortices. To investigate what spatial scale best supports high information extraction under more general conditions this study combined naturalistic movie stimuli with high-resolution fMRI at 7 T and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of global and local BOLD signal patterns. Contrary to predictions, LDA and similar classifiers reached a maximum in classification accuracy (CA) at a smoothed resolution close to 3 mm, well above the 1.2 mm voxel size of the fMRI acquisition. Maximal CAs around 90% were contingent upon global fMRI signal patterns comprising 4 k-16 k of the most reactive voxels distributed sparsely throughout the occipital and ventro-temporal cortices. A Searchlight analysis of local fMRI patterns largely confirmed the global results, but also revealed a small subset of brain regions in early visual cortex showing limited increases in CA with higher resolution. Principal component analysis of the global and local fMRI signal patterns suggested that reproducible neuronal contributions were spatially auto-correlated and smooth, while other components of higher spatial frequency were likely related to physiological noise and responsible for the reduced CA at higher resolution. Systematic differences between experiments and subjects suggested that higher CA was significantly correlated with more consistent behavior revealed by eye tracking. Thus, the optimal resolution of fMRI data for MVPA was mainly limited by physiological noise of high spatial frequency as well as behavioral (in-)consistency.	[Mandelkow, H.; de Zwart, J.

In this work, we use variational mode decomposition (VMD) to precisely decompose the rs-fMRI time series into its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in a datadriven manner. The accuracy of the VMD decomposition of constituent IMFs is verified through simulations, with higher reconstruction accuracy and much-reduced mode mixing relative to previous methods. Furthermore, we examine the relative contribution of the VMD-derived modes (frequencies) to the rs-fMRI signal as well as functional connectivity measurements. Our primary findings are: (1) The rs-fMRI signal within the 0.01-0.25 Hz range can be consistently characterized by four intrinsic frequency clusters, centered at 0.028 Hz (IMF4), 0.080 Hz (IMF3), 0.15 Hz (IMF2) and 0.22 Hz (IMF1); (2) these frequency clusters were highly reproducible, and independent of rs-fMRI data sampling rate; (3) not all frequencies were associated with equivalent network topology, in contrast to previous findings. In fact, while IMF4 is most likely associated with physiological fluctuations due to respiration and pulse, IMF3 is most likely associated with metabolic processes, and IMF2 with vasomotor activity. Both IMF3 and IMF4 could produce the brain-network topology typically observed in fMRI, whereas IMF1 and IMF2 could not. These findings provide initial evidence of feasibility in decomposing the rs-fMRI signal into its intrinsic oscillatory frequencies in a reproducible manner.

Most UHF-fMRI studies utilize the dramatic increases in sensitivity and specificity to acquire high-resolution data reaching sub-millimeter scales, which enable new classes of experiments to probe the functional organization of the human brain. This review article surveys advanced data analysis strategies developed for high-resolution fMRI at UHF. These include strategies designed to mitigate distortion and artifacts associated with higher fields in ways that attempt to preserve spatial resolution of the fMRI data, as well as recently introduced analysis techniques that are enabled by these extremely high-resolution data. Particular focus is placed on anatomically-informed analyses, including cortical surface-based analysis, which are powerful techniques that can guide each step of the analysis from preprocessing to statistical analysis to interpretation and visualization. New intracortical analysis techniques for laminar and columnar fMRI are also reviewed and discussed. Prospects for single-subject individualized analyses are also presented and discussed. Altogether, there are both specific challenges and opportunities presented by UHF-fMRI, and the use of proper analysis strategies can help these valuable data reach their full potential.

Due to the complementary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and given the possibility of simultaneous acquisition, the joint data analysis can afford a better understanding of the underlying neural activity estimation. In this simulation study we want to show the benefit of the joint EEG-fMRI neural activity estimation in a Bayesian framework. Approach. We built a dynamic Bayesian framework in order to perform joint EEG-fMRI neural activity time course estimation. The neural activity is originated by a given brain area and detected by means of both measurement techniques. We have chosen a resting state neural activity situation to address the worst case in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. To infer information by EEG and fMRI concurrently we used a tool belonging to the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods: the particle filter (PF). Main results. First, despite a high computational cost, we showed the feasibility of such an approach. Second, we obtained an improvement in neural activity reconstruction when using both EEG and fMRI measurements. Significance. The proposed simulation shows the improvements in neural activity reconstruction with EEG-fMRI simultaneous data. The application of such an approach to real data allows a better comprehension of the neural dynamics.

Prospects of Synchronous fMRI-EEG Recording as the Basis for Neurofeedback (Exemplified on Patient with Stroke Sequelae)	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						interactive brain stimulation; fMRI-EEG mapping; stroke; biofeedback; neurorehabilitation	REAL-TIME FMRI	Synchronous fMRI-EEG mapping of cerebral activity in stroke patients made it possible to implement neurofeedback, a novel and promising therapeutic technology. This method integrates a real-time monitoring of cerebral activity by EEG and fMRI signals and training of the patients to control this activity simultaneously or alternatively via neurofeedback. The targets of such cerebral stimulation are cortical regions controlling arbitrary movements (Brodmann area 4), whereas its aim is optimization of activity in these regions in order to achieve better rehabilitation of stroke patients. The paper discusses the methodical details, advantages, and promise of bimodal neurofeedback treatment.	[Savelov, A. A.; Petrovskii, E. D.; Pokrovskii, M.

Methods: The study is a retrospective chart review investigating the use of clinical fMRI from 2002 through 2013 in the preoperative evaluation of brain tumour patients. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected. The specific fMRI protocols used for each patient were recorded. Results: Sixty patients were identified over the 12-year period. The tumour types most commonly investigated were high-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade III or IV), low-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade II), and meningioma. Most common presenting symptoms were seizures (69.6%), language deficits (23.2%), and headache (19.6%). There was a predominance of left hemispheric lesions investigated with fMRI (76.8% vs 23.2% for right). The most commonly involved lobes were frontal (64.3%), temporal (33.9%), parietal (21.4%), and insular (7.1%). The most common fMRI paradigms were language (83.9%), motor (75.0%), sensory (16.1%), and memory (10.7%). The majority of patients ultimately underwent a craniotomy (75.0%), whereas smaller groups underwent stereotactic biopsy (8.9%) and nonsurgical management (16.1%). Time from request for fMRI to actual fMRI acquisition was 3.1 +/- 2.3 weeks. Time from fMRI acquisition to intervention was 4.9 +/- 5.5 weeks. Conclusions: We have characterized patient demographics in a retrospective single-surgeon cohort undergoing preoperative clinical fMRI at a Canadian centre. Our experience suggests an acceptable wait time from scan request to scan completion/analysis and from scan to intervention.

Subject motion during fMRI scans reduces statistical significance of the activation maps and increases the prevalence of false activations. Motion correction is therefore an essential tool for a successful fMRI data analysis. Retrospective motion correction techniques are now commonplace and are incorporated into a wide range of fMRI analysis toolboxes. These techniques are advantageous due to robustness, sequence independence and have minimal impact on the fMRI study setup. Retrospective techniques however, do not provide an accurate intra-volume correction, nor can these techniques correct for the spin-history effects. The application of prospective motion correction in fMRI appears to be effective in reducing false positives and increasing sensitivity when compared to retrospective techniques, particularly in the cases of substantial motion. Especially advantageous in this regard is the combination of prospective motion correction with dynamic distortion correction. Nevertheless, none of the recent methods are able to recover activations in presence of motion that are comparable to no-motion conditions, which motivates further research in the area of adaptive dynamic imaging.

We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) with electroencephalography (EEG) and collected fMRI data from identical experiments where participants performed visual and auditory discrimination tasks separately or simultaneously and with or without distractors. To overcome the low temporal resolution of fMRI, we used a novel ERP-based application of multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) to parse time-averaged fMRI pattern activity into distinct spatial maps that each corresponded, in representational structure, to a short temporal ERP segment. Discriminant analysis of ERP-fMRI correlations revealed 8 cortical networks-2 sensory, 3 attention, and 3 other-segregated by 4 orthogonal, temporally multifaceted and spatially distributed functions. We interpret these functions as 4 spatiotemporal components of attention: modality-dependent and stimulus-driven orienting, top-down control, mode transition, and response preparation, selection and execution.

We argue that fMRI research is not always restricted to correlational statements when it is combined with perturbation techniques and can sometimes permit some degree of causal inferencing, such as when bodily illusions are examined with fMRI. In these instances, one is changing a participant's conscious bodily self by experimentally perturbing mechanisms that are involved in multisensory integration.

Template-based prediction of vigilance fluctuations in resting-state fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Vigilance; Global signal; Eyes-open; Eyes-closed; Caffeine	INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; GLOBAL SIGNAL; SLEEP; WAKEFULNESS; CAFFEINE; BRAIN; ALERTNESS	Changes in vigilance or alertness during a typical resting state fMRI scan are inevitable and have been found to affect measures of functional brain connectivity. Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study, conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions. We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking these correlation maps as "templates" for vigilance estimation, we found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the overall amount of variability in a subject's vigilance state, and that the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.

An important approach for understanding the dynamics of neuronal activity in the resting state is to use complementary imaging modalities. Electrophysiological recordings can access fast temporal dynamics, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reveal detailed spatial patterns. However, the relationship between these two measures is not fully established. In this study, we used simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI, along with Hidden Markov Modelling, to investigate how network dynamics at fast sub-second time-scales, accessible with EEG, link to the slower time-scales and higher spatial detail of fMRI. We found that the fMRI correlates of fast transient EEG dynamic networks show highly reproducible spatial patterns, and that their spatial organization exhibits strong similarity with traditional fMRI resting state networks maps. This further demonstrates the potential of electrophysiology as a tool for understanding the fast network dynamics that underlie fMRI resting state networks.

To date, such decoding paradigms were mostly used for visual modalities. On the other hand, reconstructing functional brain activity in motor areas was primarily achieved through more invasive electrophysiological techniques. Here, we investigated whether non-invasive fMRI responses from human motor cortex can also be used to predict individual arm movements. To this end, we conducted fMRI studies in which participants moved their arm from a center position to one of eight target directions. Our results suggest that arm movement directions can be distinguished from the multivoxel patterns of fMRI responses in motor cortex. Furthermore, compared to multivoxel pattern analysis, encoding models were able to also reconstruct unknown movement directions from the predicted brain activity. We conclude for our study that non-invasive fMRI signal can be utilized to predict directional motor movements in human motor cortex.

Methods A brain functional activity is represented in terms of magnetic source by a perturbation model chi = chi(0) + delta(chi), with d. for BOLD magnetic perturbations and. chi(0) for background. A brain fMRI experiment produces a timeseries of complex-valued images (T2* images), whereby we extract the BOLD phase signals (denoted by delta P) by a complex division. By solving an inverse problem, we reconstruct the BOLD delta chi dataset from the delta P dataset, and the brain. distribution from a (unwrapped) T2* phase image. Given a 4D dataset of task BOLD fMRI, we implement brain functional mapping by temporal correlation analysis. Results Through a high-field (7T) and high-resolution (0.5mm in plane) task fMRI experiment, we demonstrated in detail the BOLD perturbation model for fMRI phase signal separation (P + delta P) and reconstructing intrinsic brain magnetic source (chi and delta chi). We also provided to a low-field (3T) and low-resolution (2mm) task fMRI experiment in support of single-subject fMRI study. Our experiments show that the delta chi-depicted functional map reveals bidirectional BOLD. perturbations during the task performance. Conclusions The BOLD perturbation model allows us to separate fMRI phase signal (by complex division) and to perform inverse mapping for pure BOLD delta chi reconstruction for intrinsic functional. mapping. The full brain. reconstruction (from unwrapped fMRI phase) provides a new brain tissue image that allows to scrutinize the brain tissue idiosyncrasy for the pure BOLD delta chi response through an automatic function/structure co-localization.

In the present work, we studied two CGE-FoS epileptic patients with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. We aim to identify brain areas that are specifically related to the pathology by identifying the brain networks that are related to the EEG brain altered rhythms. Three main analyses were performed: EEG standalone, where the voltage fluctuations in delta, alpha, and beta EEG bands were obtained; fMRI standalone, where resting-state fMRI ICA analyses for opened and closed eyes conditions were computed per subject; and, EEG-informed fMRI, where EEG delta, alpha and beta oscillations were used to analyze fMRI. Patient 1 showed EEG abnormalities for lower beta band EEG brain rhythm. Fluctuations of this rhythm were correlated with a brain network mainly composed by temporo-frontal areas only found in the closed eyes condition. Patient 2 presented alterations in all the EEG brain rhythms (delta, alpha, beta) under study when closing eyes. Several biologically relevant brain networks highly correlated (r>0.7) to each other in the closed eyes condition were found. EEG-informed fMRI results in patient 2 showed hypersynchronized patterns in the fMRI correlation spatial maps. The obtained findings allow a differential diagnosis for each patient and different profiles with respect to healthy volunteers. The results suggest a different disruption in the functional brain networks of these patients that depends on their altered brain rhythms. This knowledge could be used to treat these patients by novel brain stimulation approaches targeting specific altered brain networks in each patient.

To illustrate the patterns of interactions between the dorsal and ventral visual systems in text reading, we conducted analyses of functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity (EC) in a left-hemispheric network for reading-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. In reading-driven fMRI (Experiment 1), we found significant FCs among the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the visual word form area (VWFA), and there were topdown effects from the left MFG to the left IPS, from the left MFG to the VWFA, and from the left IPS to the VWFA. In rs-fMRI (Experiment 2), we identified FCs and ECs for MFG-IPS and IPS-VWFA connections. In addition, the brainbehavior relationship in resting states showed that the dorsal connection was more associated with reading fluency relative to lexical decision. The combination of two experiments revealed that the MFG-IPS and the VWFA-IPS connections were shared connections both in reading-driven fMRI and rs-fMRI, and that the MFG-VWFA was specific connectivity in reading-driven fMRI. These results suggest that topdown effects from the dorsal visual system to ventral visual system play an important role in text reading.

Multimodal Classification of Schizophrenia Patients with MEG and fMRI Data Using Static and Dynamic Connectivity Measures	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						connectivity; fMRI; MEG; Schizophrenia; static and dynamic functional connectivity; classification	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY; MODEL; ICA; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; SEPARATION	Mental disorders like schizophrenia are currently diagnosed by physicians/psychiatrists through clinical assessment and their evaluation of patient's self-reported experiences as the illness emerges. There is great interest in identifying biological markers of prognosis at the onset of illness, rather than relying on the evolution of symptoms across time. Functional network connectivity, which indicates a subject's overall level of "synchronicity" of activity between brain regions, demonstrates promise in providing individual subject predictive power. Many previous studies reported functional connectivity changes during resting-state using only functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nevertheless, exclusive reliance on fMRI to generate such networks may limit the inference of the underlying dysfunctional connectivity, which is hypothesized to be a factor in patient symptoms, as fMRI measures connectivity via hemodynamics. Therefore, combination of connectivity assessments using fMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG), which more directly measures neuronal activity, may provide improved classification of schizophrenia than either modality alone. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that metrics of dynamic connectivity may also be critical for understanding pathology in schizophrenia. In this work, we propose a new framework for extraction of important disease related features and classification of patients with schizophrenia based on using both fMRI and MEG to investigate functional network components in the resting state. Results of this study show that the integration of fMRI and MEG provides important information that captures fundamental characteristics of functional network connectivity in schizophrenia and is helpful for prediction of schizophrenia patient group membership. Combined fMRI/MEG methods, using static functional network connectivity analyses, improved classification accuracy relative to use of fMRI or MEG methods alone (by 15 and 12.45%, respectively), while combined fMRI/MEG methods using dynamic functional network connectivity analyses improved classification up to 5.12% relative to use of fMRI alone and up to 17.21% relative to use of MEG alone.

However, there are many instances when this method is unsuccessful or not applicable, and other data driven fMRI methods may be utilized. One such method is the two-dimensional temporal clustering analysis (2dTCA). In this study we compared the classic EEG-fMRI and 2dTCA performance in mapping regions related to the seizure onset region in 18 focal epilepsy patients (12 presenting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), during EEG-fMRI acquisition) with Engel I or II surgical outcome. Activation maps of both 2dTCA timing outputs (positive and negative histograms) and EEG detected IEDs were computed and compared to the region of epilepsy surgical resection. Patients were evaluated in three categories based on frequency of EEG detected spiking during the MRI. EEG-fMRI maps were concordant to the epilepsy region in 5/12 subjects, four with frequent IEDs on EEG. The 2dTCA was successful in mapping 13/18 patients including 3/6 with no IEDs detected (10/12 with IEDs detected). The epilepsy-related activities were successfully mapped by both methods in only 4/12 patients. This work suggests that the epilepsy-related information detected by each method may be different: while EEG-fMRI is more accurate in patients with high rather than lower numbers of EEG detected IEDs; 2dTCA can be useful in evaluating patients even when no concurrent EEG spikes are detected or EEG-fMRI is not effective. Therefore, our results support that 2dTCA might be an alternative for mapping epilepsy-related BOLD activity in negative EEG-fMRI (6/7 patients) and spike-less patients.

The influence of sample set construction on the estimation performance and the benefit of combining EEG and fMRI features remain unclear. In this study, we extracted spectral power and event-related-potentials from the Pz electrode and 9 electrodes in related lobes as the EEG feature and extracted the beta values of the activation brain regions as the fMRI feature at the two sample set construction levels of trial and run. Then we combined EEG and fMRI features. The results showed that the classification performance of memory load at the run level got higher classification accuracy when using rapid event-related experimental design. As for EEG features, the classification performance of memory load was related to channel selection. The combination of EEG and fMRI features did not contribute to load classification accuracy.

Structural and functional quantitative susceptibility mapping from standard fMRI studies	NMR IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM)	SEP 26-28, 2016	Univ Graz, Graz, AUSTRIA		Univ Graz	quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); fMRI; functional QSM; deep grey matter; brain iron	GRADIENT-ECHO MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; IRON DEPOSITION; BASAL GANGLIA; GRAY-MATTER; PHASE DATA; VALIDATION; CONTRAST; PLANAR; MAP	Standard functional MRI (fMRI), which includes resting-state or paradigm-driven designs, is widely used in studies of brain function, aging, and disease. These fMRI studies typically use two-dimensional gradient echo-planar imaging, which inherently contains phase data that enables quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). This work focuses on the dual value of QSM within fMRI studies, by providing both a localized analysis of functional changes in activated tissue, and iron-sensitive structural maps in deep grey matter (DGM). Using a visual paradigm fMRI study on healthy volunteers at clinical (1.5 T) and high field strength (4.7 T), we perform functional analysis of magnitude andQSMtime series, andat thesametime harness structuralQSMof iron-richDGM, including globus pallidus, putamen, caudate head, substantia nigra, and red nucleus. The effects of fMRI spatial resolution and time series variation on structuralDGMQSMare investigated. Ourresults indicate that structuralDGMQSMis feasible within existing fMRI studies, provided that the voxel dimensions are equal to or less than3 mm, with higher resolutions preferred. ThemeanDGM QSMvalues were about 40 to 220 ppb, while the interquartile ranges of theDGMQSMtime series varied from about 3 to 9 ppb, depending on structure and resolution. In contrast, the peak voxel functional QSM (fQSM) changes in activated visual cortex ranged from about -10 to -30 ppb, and functional clusters were consistently smaller on QSM than magnitude fMRI. Mean-levelDGMQSMof the time series was successfully extracted in all cases, while fQSMresults were moreprone to residual background fields and showed less functional change compared with standard magnitude fMRI. Under the conditions prescribed, standard fMRI studiesmaybe used for robust mean-levelDGMQSM, enabling study of DGM iron accumulation, in addition to functional analysis.

Previous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and with magneto-and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) have demonstrated consistent temporal dynamics of brain activity across movie viewers. However, little is known about the similarities and differences of fMRI and MEG or EEG dynamics during such naturalistic situations. We thus compared MEG and fMRI responses to the same 15-min black-and-white movie in the same eight subjects who watched the movie twice during both MEG and fMRI recordings. We analyzed intra-and intersubject voxel-wise correlations within each imaging modality as well as the correlation of the MEG envelopes and fMRI signals. The fMRI signals showed voxel-wise within-and between-subjects correlations up to r = 0.66 and r = 0.37, respectively, whereas these correlations were clearly weaker for the envelopes of band-pass filtered (7 frequency bands below 100 Hz) MEG signals (within-subjects correlation r < 0.14 and between-subjects r < 0.05). Direct MEG-fMRI voxel-wise correlations were unreliable. Notably, applying a spatial-filtering approach to the MEG data uncovered consistent canonical variates that showed considerably stronger (up to r = 0.25) between-subjects correlations than the univariate voxel-wise analysis. Furthermore, the envelopes of the time courses of these variates up to about 10 Hz showed association with fMRI signals in a general linear model. Similarities between envelopes of MEG canonical variates and fMRI voxel time-courses were seen mostly in occipital, but also in temporal and frontal brain regions, whereas intra-and intersubject correlations for MEG and fMRI separately were strongest only in the occipital areas. In contrast to the conventional univariate analysis, the spatial-filtering approach was able to uncover associations between the MEG envelopes and fMRI time courses, shedding light on the similarities of hemodynamic and electromagnetic brain activities during movie viewing.

Compressed Sensing (CS) based methods for accelerating fMRI data acquisition are promising. Other advanced algorithms like k-t FOCUSS or PICCS have been developed to improve performance. This study aims to investigate a new method, Dual-TRACER, based on Temporal Resolution Acceleration with Constrained Evolution Reconstruction (TRACER), for accelerating fMRI acquisitions using golden angle variable density spiral. Both numerical simulations and in vivo experiments at 3T were conducted to evaluate and characterize this method. Results show that Dual-TRACER can provide functional images with a high spatial resolution (1x1 mm(2)) under an acceleration factor of 20 while maintaining hemodynamic signals well. Compared with other investigated methods, dual-TRACER provides a better signal recovery, higher fMRI sensitivity and more reliable activation detection.

Multiple resting-state networks have been identified, including the somatosensory, language, and visual networks, which are of primary importance for surgical planning. We discuss the feasibility of rest-fMRI examination before and after surgical resection of brain tumors in routine clinical practice and the usefulness of the information obtained for surgical planning in brain tumor resection. rest-fMRI is particularly useful for patients who are unable to cooperate with the task-based paradigm, such as children or patients who are sedated, paretic, or aphasic. Although standardization and validation of rest-fMRI are still ongoing, this technique is feasible and valuable and can be implemented for routine clinical surgical planning.

Methods: Patients with refractory extra-temporal focal epilepsy, referred for presurgical evaluation were recruited in a period of 18 months. The EEG-fMRI based localization was presented during a multi-disciplinary meeting after the team had defined the presumed Results: Sixteen patients (six women), with a median age of 28 years, were recruited. Interpretable EEG-fMRI results were available in 13: interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were recorded in eleven patients and seizures were recorded in two patients. In three patients, no epileptic activity was captured during EEG-fMRI acquisition and in two of those an IED topographic map correlation was performed (between EEG recorded inside the scanner and long-term video EEG monitoring). EEG-fMRI results presentation had no impact on the initial clinical decision in three patients (23%) of the thirteen and resulted in a modification of the initial surgical plan in ten patients (77%) of the thirteen finally presented in MDT; in eight patients the impact was on the planned placement of invasive electrodes and in two patients the EEG-fMRI led to additional non-invasive tests before proceeding further with surgery. Conclusion: The study is a prospective observational cohort study specifically designed to assess the impact of EEG-fMRI on the clinical decision making process, suggesting a significant influence of EEG-fMRI on epilepsy surgery planning.

Inspired by the intrinsic structural differences between gyri and sulci, in this paper, we present a data-driven framework based on sparse representation of fMRI data for functional network inferences, then examine the interactions within and across gyral and sulcal functional networks and finally elucidate possible functional differences using graph theory based properties. We apply the proposed framework to the high-resolution Human Connectome Project (HCP) grayordinate fMRI data. Extensive experimental results on both resting state fMRI data and task-based fMRI data consistently suggested that gyri are more functionally integrated, while sulci are more functionally segregated in the organizational architecture of cerebral cortex, offering novel understanding of the byzantine cerebral cortex.

It is unclear to what extent this information originates from different spatial scales of neuronal selectivity, ranging from orientation columns to global areal maps. According to the global-areal-map account, fMRI orientation decoding relies exclusively on fMRI voxels in V1 exhibiting a radial or vertical preference. Here we show, by contrast, that 2-mm isotropic voxels in a small patch of V1 within a quarterfield representation exhibit reliable opposite selectivities. Sets of voxels with opposite selectivities are locally intermingled and each set can support orientation decoding. This indicates that global areal maps cannot fully account for orientation information in fMRI and demonstrates that fMRI also reflects fine-grained patterns of neuronal selectivity.

A novel and effective fMRI decoding approach based on sliced inverse regression and its application to pain prediction	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						fMRI decoding; Dimension reduction; Sliced inverse regression; Pain prediction	MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; DIMENSION REDUCTION; DATA VISUALIZATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; NETWORK; DYNAMICS; MODEL	Dimension reduction is essential in fMRI decoding, but the complex relationship between fMRI data and class labels is often unknown or not well modeled so that the most effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) directions can hardly be identified. In the present study, we introduce a novel fMRI decoding approach based on an effective and general dimension reduction method, namely sliced inverse regression (SIR), which can exploit class information for estimating e.d.r. directions even when the relationship between fMRI data and class labels is not explicitly known. We incorporate singular value decomposition (SVD) into SIR to overcome SIR's limitation in dealing with ultra-high-dimensional data, and integrate SVD-SIR into a pattern classifier to enable quantification of the contributions of fMRI voxels to class labels. The resultant new SIR decoding analysis (SIR-DA) approach is capable of decoding behavioral responses and identifying predictive fMRI patterns. Simulation results showed that SIR-DA can more accurately detect e.d.r. directions and achieve higher classification accuracy than decoding approaches based on conventional dimension reduction methods. Further, we applied SIR-DA on real-world pain-evoked fMRI data to decode the level of pain perception and showed that SIR-DA can achieve higher accuracy in pain prediction than conventional methods. These results suggest that SIR-DA is an effective data-driven technique to decode behavioral or cognitive states from fMRI data and to uncover unknown brain patterns associated with behavior or cognitive responses.

The neural basis of such interference remains unknown. We employed a novel fMRI prime-target embedded word paradigm to test for involvement of a visual word form area (VWFA) in left ventral occipitotemporal cortex in co-activation of embedded words and their carriers. Based on the results of related fMRI studies we predicted either enhancement or suppression of fMRI responses to embedded words initially viewed as primes, and repeated in the context of target carrier words. Our results clearly showed enhancement of fMRI responses in the VWFA to embedded-carrier word pairs as compared to unrelated prime-target pairs. In contrast to non-visual language-related areas (e.g., left inferior frontal gyrus), enhanced fMRI responses did not occur in the VWFA when embedded-carrier word pairs were restricted to the left visual hemifield. Our finding of fMRI enhancement in the VWFA is novel evidence of its involvement in representational rivalry between orthographically similar words, and the co-activation of embedded words and their carriers.

In glioma patients, fMRI is frequently used to determine the individual functional anatomy of the motor and language network in a presurgical setting to optimize surgical procedures and prevent extensive damage to functionally eloquent areas. Novel developments based on resting-state fMRI may help to improve presurgical planning for patients which are unable to perform structured tasks and might extend presurgical mapping to include additional functional networks. Recent advances indicate a promising potential for future applications of fMRI in glioma patients which might help to identify neoplastic tissue or predict the long-term functional outcome of individual patients.

Adaptive independent vector analysis for multi-subject complex-valued fMRI data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Independent vector analysis (IVA); Complex-valued fMRI data; MGGD; Shape parameter; Subspace de-noising; Post-IVA phase de-noising; Noncircularity	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PHASE; ICA; SEPARATION; DECOMPOSITION; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; MAGNITUDE; BOLD	Background: Complex-valued fMRI data can provide additional insights beyond magnitude-only data. However, independent vector analysis (IVA), which has exhibited great potential for group analysis of magnitude-only fMRI data, has rarely been applied to complex-valued fMRI data. The main challenges in this application include the extremely noisy nature and large variability of the source component vector (SCV) distribution. New method: To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive fixed-point IVA algorithm for analyzing multiple-subject complex-valued fMRI data. We exploited a multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution (MGGD)-based nonlinear function to match varying SCV distributions in which the MGGD shape parameter was estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. To achieve our de-noising goal, we updated the MGGD-based nonlinearity in the dominant SCV subspace, and employed a post-IVA de-noising strategy based on phase information in the IVA estimates. We also incorporated the pseudo covariance matrix of fMRI data into the algorithm to emphasize the noncircularity of complex-valued fMRI sources. Results: Results from simulated and experimental fMRI data demonstrated the efficacy of our method. Comparison with existing method(s): Our approach exhibited significant improvements over typical complex-valued IVA algorithms, especially during higher noise levels and larger spatial and temporal changes. As expected, the proposed complex-valued IVA algorithm detected more contiguous and reasonable activations than the magnitude-only method for task-related (393%) and default mode (301%) spatial maps.

J	Soch, J; Allefeld, C				Soch, Joram; Allefeld, Carsten			MACS - a new SPM toolbox for model assessment, comparison and selection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						fMRI-based neuroimaging; mass-univariate GLM; SPM toolbox; analysis pipelines; model assessment; model comparison; model selection; model averaging	DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; FMRI TIME-SERIES; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; FREE-ENERGY; TESTS	Background: In cognitive neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are widely analyzed using general linear models (GLMs). However, model quality of GLMs for fMRI is rarely assessed, in part due to the lack of formal measures for statistical model inference. New method: We introduce a new SPM toolbox for model assessment, comparison and selection (MACS) of GLMs applied to fMRI data. MACS includes classical, information-theoretic and Bayesian methods of model assessment previously applied to GLMs for fMRI as well as recent methodological developments of model selection and model averaging in fMRI data analysis. Results: The toolbox which is freely available from GitHub directly builds on the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package and is easy-to-use, general-purpose, modular, readable and extendable. We validate the toolbox by reproducing model selection and model averaging results from earlier publications. Comparison with existing methods: A previous toolbox for model diagnosis in fMRI has been discontinued and other approaches to model comparison between GLMs have not been translated into reusable computational resources in the past. Conclusions: Increased attention on model quality will lead to lower false-positive rates in cognitive neuroscience and increased application of the MACS toolbox will increase the reproducibility of GLM analyses and is likely to increase the replicability of fMRI studies.

The predominant stimulus used in task-based fMRI in the mouse is electrical stimulation of the paw. Task-based fMRI in mice using visual stimuli remains underexplored, despite visual stimuli being common in human fMRI studies. In this study, we map the mouse brain visual system with BOLD measurements at 9.4 T using flashing light stimuli with medetomidine anaesthesia. BOLD responses were observed in the lateral geniculate nucleus, the superior colliculus and the primary visual area of the cortex, and were modulated by the flashing frequency, diffuse vs focussed light and stimulus context. Negative BOLD responses were measured in the visual cortex at 10 Hz flashing frequency; but turned positive below 5 Hz. In addition, the use of interleaved snapshot GE-EPI improved fMRI image quality without diminishing the temporal contrast-noise-ratio. Taken together, this work demonstrates a novel methodological protocol in which the mouse brain visual system can be non-invasively investigated using BOLD fMRI. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Here, we developed an MRI-guided robotic arm (MgRA) as a flexible positioning system with high precision to real-time assist optical fiber brain intervention for multi-modal animal fMRI. Besides the ex vivo precision evaluation, we present the highly reliable brain activity patterns in the projected basal forebrain regions upon MgRA-driven optogenetic stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus. Also, we show the step-wise optical fiber targeting thalamic nuclei and map the region-specific functional connectivity with whole-brain fMRI accompanied by simultaneous calcium recordings to specify its circuit-specificity. The MgRA also guides the real-time microinjection to specific deep brain nuclei, which is demonstrated by an Mn-enhanced MRI method. The MgRA represents a clear advantage over the standard stereotaxic-based fiber implantation and opens a broad avenue to investigate the circuit-specific functional brain mapping with the multi-modal fMRI platform.

We mapped individual vessels penetrating the rat somatosensory cortex with 100-ms temporal resolution by MRI with sensory or optogenetic stimulation. The BOLD signal originated primarily from venules, and the CBV signal from arterioles. The single-vessel fMRI method and its combination with optogenetics provide a platform for mapping the hemodynamic signal through the neurovascular network with specificity at the level of individual arterioles and venules.

J	Efromovich, S				Efromovich, Sam			Statistical analysis of fMRI using wavelets: Big Data, denoising, large-<i>p</i>-small-<i>n</i> matrices	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Big Data; fMRI; wavelet analysis	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; BRAIN NETWORKS; PLASTICITY; ANTICORRELATIONS; CHALLENGES; CONFOUNDS; MODEL; MRI; EEG	Over the past decade functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been intensively used to study the complex functional network organization of the human brain and how it changes in time. An fMRI machine produces 3D time-course cerebral images that contain hundreds of thousands of voxels and each voxel is scanned for hundreds of times. This potentially allows the researchers to explore functional connectivity on a voxel-to-voxel level, and also yields a number of serious statistical complications. First of all, the high-dimension property of fMRI data turns it into Big Data. Furthermore, the study of functional brain network for so many voxels involves the problem of estimation of and simultaneous inference for large-p-small-n cross-covariance matrices. Furthermore, all problems should be solved in the presence of notoriously large fMRI noise which often forces statisticians to average signals over large areas instead of considering a network between individual voxels. An attractive alternative to the averaging, discussed in the paper, is a multiresolution wavelet analysis complemented by special procedures of estimating noise and estimation and simultaneous inference for cross-covariance and cross-correlation matrices for hundreds of thousands pairs of voxels, and it is fair to say that if wavelets have not been already known, fMRI applications would necessitates their creation. Both task and resting-state fMRI are considered, and lessons from the wavelet analysis of ultra-fast and conventional neuroplasticity fMRI experiments are presented. The article is self-contained and does not require familiarity with wavelets or fMRI.

However, rodent fMRI studies of somatosensory stimulation have commonly reported BOLD changes only in S1FL, which may be due to side effects of anesthetics and/or the low sensitivity in the thalamus. Thus, we have obtained mouse BOLD fMRI under newly-adopted ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. High-resolution BOLD fMRI obtained with same imaging parameters at 9.4T versus 15.2T shows the improvement of functional detectability by >= 2 times at 15.2T due to higher signal intensity and larger BOLD response. The fMRI responses at 15.2T were robustly observed at well-known somatosensory networks including thalamus. Second, echo-time-dependent BOLD signals are dominant based on multi-echo fMRI data. A ratio of BOLD responses in S1FL to thalamus is similar to 2, which is not related to different baseline T-2(*) or different cerebral blood volume. Third, group-averaged 15.2T BOLD maps show activities in S1FL, S2, motor cortices, and thalamic nuclei, which agree well with neural tracing network data from the Allen Institute, demonstrating that fMRI detects entire somatosensory networks. Our data suggest that ultrahigh field fMRI provides a unique window into understanding functional networks in normal and transgenic mouse models noninvasively.

Comparison of separation performance of independent component analysis algorithms for fMRI data	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain; blood oxygenation level dependent signals; blind source separation; spatial sorting; temporal sorting; mutual information; resting state networks	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; MRI; TOOLBOX; NETWORK; ICA	Independent component analysis, a data-driven analysis method, has found significant applications in task-based as well as resting state fMRI studies. There are numbers of independent component analysis algorithms available, but only a few of them have been used frequently so far for fMRI images. With a view that algorithms that are overlooked may outperform the most opted, a comparative study is taken up in this paper to analyze their abilities for the purpose of synthesis of fMRI images. In this paper, ten independent component algorithms: Fast ICA, INFOMAX, SIMBEC, JADE, ERICA, EVD, RADICAL, ICA-EBM, ERBM, and COMBI are compared. Their separation abilities are adjudged on both, synthetic and real fMRI images. Performance to decompose synthetic fMRI images is being monitored on the basis of spatial correlation coefficients, time elapsed to extract independent components and the visual appearance of independent components. Ranking of their performances on task-based real fMRI images are based on the closeness of time courses of identified independent components with model time course and the closeness of spatial maps of components with spatial templates while their competencies for resting state fMRI data are analyzed by examining how distinctly they decompose the data into the most consistent resting state networks. Sum of mutual information between all the permutations of decomposed components of resting state fMRI data are also calculated.	[Sariya, Yogesh Kumar; Anand, R.

Activation volume vs BOLD signal change as measures of fMRI activation - Its impact on GABA - fMRI activation correlation	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						fMRI; GABA; BOLD signal; Activation volume	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; WATER-SUPPRESSION; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; ACID; QUANTIFICATION; PLASTICITY	Purpose: To explore the relative robustness of functional MRI (fMRI) activation volume and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal change as fMRI metric, and to study the effect of relative robustness on the correlation between fMRI activation and cortical gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: fMRI data were acquired from healthy controls and patients with MS, with the subjects peforming self paced bilateral finger tapping in block design. GABA spectroscopy was performed with voxel placed on the area of maximum activation during fMRI. Activation volume and BOLD signal changes at primary motor cortex (M1), as well as GABA concentration were calculated for each patient. Results: Activation volume correlated with BOLD signal change in healthy controls, but no such correlation was observed in patients with MS. This difference was likely the result of higher intersubject noise variance in the patient population. GABA concentration correlated with M1 activation volume in patients but not in controls, and did not correlate with any fMRI metric in patients or controls. Conclusion: Our data suggest that activation volume is a more robust measure than BOLD signal change in a group with high intersubject noise variance as in patients with MS. Additionally, this study demonstrated difference in correlation behavior between GABA concentration and the 2 fMRI metrics in patients with MS, suggesting that GABA - activation volume correlation is more appropriate measure in the patient group.

An efficient FMRI classification technique in cloud using multiple parallel feature selection algorithm	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Feature selection; Independent component analysis (ICA); Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machine (SVM)		Extensive research is going on in the field of analyzing the applications involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with the help of machine learning classifiers. Studies have proven that inspiring new information can be obtained through neuroimaging data using machine learning classifiers. Feature selection has been an active research area and its key idea is to select a subset of input variables by removing features with little or no predictive data. Feature selection enhanced the clarity of the resulting classifier models and often dimensions a model that generalizes better to unseen points. In this work, fMRI classification technique is proposed using Multiple Parallel Feature Selection Algorithm. In case of parallel feature selection, the proposed algorithm's computation is fully improved and parallelized based on data partitioning. Inputs for classifiers are used extensively through voxel-based features. The fMRI images are classified as normal or abnormal. From healthy persons normal fMRI images were obtained and from subjects with schizophrenia abnormal fMRI were obtained and a total of 140 normal fMRI and 67 abnormal fMRI were used. Multiple particle swarm optimization was used after independent component analysis phase and techniques varying by c1 and c2 were used through cluster computing techniques. From the obtained cluster the feature subset was selected and support vector machine is made use in classifying.	[Priya, M.

Integrated Analysis of EEG and fMRI Using Sparsity of Spatial Maps	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Integration analysis; Referenced-based signal processing; Weighted sparse decomposition; Elastic net; Pareto optimization	MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; MEG; SELECTION; MODEL; REGULARIZATION; REGRESSION; SIGNAL	Integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an open problem, which has motivated many researches. The most important challenge in EEG-fMRI integration is the unknown relationship between these two modalities. In this paper, we extract the same features (spatial map of neural activity) from both modality. Therefore, the proposed integration method does not need any assumption about the relationship of EEG and fMRI. We present a source localization method from scalp EEG signal using jointly fMRI analysis results as prior spatial information and source separation for providing temporal courses of sources of interest. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated quantitatively along with multiple sparse priors method and sparse Bayesian learning with the fMRI results as prior information. Localization bias and source distribution index are used to measure the performance of different localization approaches with or without a variety of fMRI-EEG mismatches on simulated realistic data. The method is also applied to experimental data of face perception of 16 subjects. Simulation results show that the proposed method is significantly stable against the noise with low localization bias. Although the existence of an extra region in the fMRI data enlarges localization bias, the proposed method outperforms the other methods. Conversely, a missed region in the fMRI data does not affect the localization bias of the common sources in the EEG-fMRI data. Results on experimental data are congruent with previous studies and produce clusters in the fusiform and occipital face areas (FFA and OFA, respectively). Moreover, it shows high stability in source localization against variations in different subjects.

Unlike motor symptoms, the mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear and may involve multiple pathophysiological processes. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a fast-developing research field, and its application in cognitive impairments in PD is rapidly growing. In this review, we summarize rs-fMRI studies on cognitive function in PD and discuss the strong potential of rs-fMRI in this area. rs-fMRI can help reveal the pathophysiology of cognitive symptoms in PD, facilitate early identification of PD patients with cognitive impairment, distinguish PD dementia from dementia with Lewy bodies, and monitor and guide treatment for cognitive impairment in PD. In particular, ongoing and future longitudinal studies would enhance the ability of rs-fMRI in predicting PD dementia.

Improving fMRI reliability in presurgical mapping for brain tumours	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; FUNCTIONAL MR; LANGUAGE AREAS; NPAIRS; CORTEX; ACTIVATION; PIPELINES; RESECTION	Purpose Functional MRI (fMRI) is becoming increasingly integrated into clinical practice for presurgical mapping. Current efforts are focused on validating data quality, with reliability being a major factor. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a recently developed approach that uses receiver operating characteristic-reliability (ROC-r) to: (1) identify reliable versus unreliable data sets; (2) automatically select processing options to enhance data quality; and (3) automatically select individualised thresholds for activation maps. Methods Presurgical fMRI was conducted in 16 patients undergoing surgical treatment for brain tumours. Within-session test-retest fMRI was conducted, and ROC-reliability of the patient group was compared to a previous healthy control cohort. Individually optimised preprocessing pipelines were determined to improve reliability. Spatial correspondence was assessed by comparing the fMRI results to intraoperative cortical stimulation mapping, in terms of the distance to the nearest active fMRI voxel. Results The average ROC-r reliability for the patients was 0.58 +/- 0.03, as compared to 0.72 +/- 0.02 in healthy controls. For the patient group, this increased significantly to 0.65 +/- 0.02 by adopting optimised preprocessing pipelines. Co-localisation of the fMRI maps with cortical stimulation was significantly better for more reliable versus less reliable data sets (8.3 +/- 0.9 vs 29 +/- 3 mm, respectively). Conclusions We demonstrated ROC-r analysis for identifying reliable fMRI data sets, choosing optimal postprocessing pipelines, and selecting patient-specific thresholds. Data sets with higher reliability also showed closer spatial correspondence to cortical stimulation. ROC-r can thus identify poor fMRI data at time of scanning, allowing for repeat scans when necessary. ROC-r analysis provides optimised and automated fMRI processing for improved presurgical mapping.

Among neuroimaging techniques, resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) is currently expanding exponentially. Beyond the general neuroimaging analysis packages (e.g., SPM, AFNI and FSL), REST and DPARSF were developed to meet the increasing need of user-friendly toolboxes for R-fMRI data processing. To address recently identified methodological challenges of R-fMRI, we introduce the newly developed toolbox, DPABI, which was evolved from REST and DPARSF. DPABI incorporates recent research advances on head motion control and measurement standardization, thus allowing users to evaluate results using stringent control strategies. DPABI also emphasizes test-retest reliability and quality control of data processing. Furthermore, DPABI provides a user-friendly pipeline analysis toolkit for rat/monkey R-fMRI data analysis to reflect the rapid advances in animal imaging. In addition, DPABI includes preprocessing modules for task-based fMRI, voxel-based morphometry analysis, statistical analysis and results viewing. DPABI is designed to make data analysis require fewer manual operations, be less time-consuming, have a lower skill requirement, a smaller risk of inadvertent mistakes, and be more comparable across studies. We anticipate this open-source toolbox will assist novices and expert users alike and continue to support advancing R-fMRI methodology and its application to clinical translational studies.

However, such reconstructed networks have no correspondences across different subjects. Thus, automatic, effective, and accurate classification and recognition of these large numbers of fMRI-derived functional brain networks are very important for subsequent steps of functional brain analysis in cognitive and clinical neuroscience applications. However, this task is still a challenging and open problem due to the tremendous variability of various types of functional brain networks and the presence of various sources of noises. In recognition of the fact that convolutional neural networks (CNN) has superior capability of representing spatial patterns with huge variability and dealing with large noises, in this paper, we design, apply, and evaluate a deep 3-D CNN framework for automatic, effective, and accurate classification and recognition of large number of functional brain networks reconstructed by sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals. Our extensive experimental results based on the Human Connectome Project fMRI data showed that the proposed deep 3-D CNN can effectively and robustly perform functional networks classification and recognition tasks, while maintaining a high tolerance for mistakenly labeled training instances. This study provides a new deep learning approach for modeling functional connectomes based on fMRI data.

Therefore, to optimize fMRI protocols, it becomes crucial to investigate how physiological signal fluctuations impact various acquisition and reconstruction schemes at different acquisition speeds. In particular, further differences can arise between 2D and 3D fMRI acquisitions due to different encoding strategies, thereby impacting fMRI sensitivity in potentially significant ways. MethodsThe amount of physiological noise to be removed from the BOLD fMRI signal acquired at 7T was quantified for different sampling rates (repetition time from 3300 to 350 ms, acceleration 1 to 8) and techniques dedicated to fast fMRI (simultaneous multislice echo planar imaging [EPI] and 3D EPI). Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) performances were evaluated using temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and network characterization based on seed correlation and independent component analysis. ResultsOverall, acceleration enhanced tSNR and rsfMRI metrics. 3D EPI benefited the most from physiological noise removal at long repetition times. Differences between 2D and 3D encoding strategies disappeared at high acceleration factors (6- to 8-fold). ConclusionAfter physiological noise correction, 2D- and 3D-accelerated sequences provide similar performances at high fields, both in terms of tSNR and resting state network identification and characterization.

Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) has been routinely adopted for presurgical mapping of the surrounding functional areas. For completely utilizing such imaging data, here we show the feasibility of using presurgical fMRI for tumor delineation. In particular, we introduce a novel method dedicated to tumor detection based on independent component analysis (ICA) of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) with automatic tumor component identification. Multi-center rs-fMRI data of 32 glioma patients from three centers, plus the additional proof-of-concept data of 28 patients from the fourth center with non-brain musculoskeletal tumors, are fed into individual ICA with different total number of components (TNCs). The best-fitted tumorrelated components derived from the optimized TNCs setting are automatically determined based on a new template-matching algorithm. The success rates are 100%, 100% and 93.75% for glioma tissue detection for the three centers, respectively, and 85.19% for musculoskeletal tumor detection. We propose that the high success rate could come from the previously overlooked ability of BOLD rs-fMRI in characterizing the abnormal vascularization, vasomotion and perfusion caused by tumors. Our findings suggest an additional usage of the rs-fMRI for comprehensive presurgical assessment.

Asymmetric Weighting to Optimize Regional Sensitivity in Combined fMRI-MEG Maps	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Functional MRI; Magnetoencephalography; Multimodal Neuroimaging; Language	ROBUST; MODEL; HIPPOCAMPUS; MEMORY; SIGNAL	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are neuroimaging techniques that measure inherently different physiological processes, resulting in complementary estimates of brain activity in different regions. Combining the maps generated by each technique could thus provide a richer understanding of brain activation. However, present approaches to integration rely on a priori assumptions, such as expected patterns of brain activation in a task, or use fMRI to bias localization of MEG sources, diminishing fMRI-invisible sources. We aimed to optimize sensitivity to neural activity by developing a novel method of integrating data from the two imaging techniques. We present a data-driven method of integration that weights fMRI and MEG imaging data by estimates of data quality for each technique and region. This method was applied to a verbal object recognition task. As predicted, the two imaging techniques demonstrated sensitivity to activation in different regions. Activity was seen using fMRI, but not MEG, throughout the medial temporal lobes. Conversely, activation was seen using MEG, but not fMRI, in more lateral and anterior temporal lobe regions. Both imaging techniques were sensitive to activation in the inferior frontal gyrus. Importantly, integration maps retained activation from individual activation maps, and showed an increase in the extent of activation, owing to greater sensitivity of the integration map than either fMRI or MEG alone.

Resting-state fMRI and social cognition: An opportunity to connect	HUMAN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL			English	Article						intrinsic functional connectivity; resting functional connectivity; resting-state fMRI; social cognition; task-free fMRI	DEFAULT MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE	Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by altered social cognition. The importance of social cognition has previously been recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria project, in which it features as a core domain. Social task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) currently offers the most direct insight into how the brain processes social information; however, resting-state fMRI may be just as important in understanding the biology and network nature of social processing. Resting-state fMRI allows researchers to investigate the functional relationships between brain regions in a neutral state: so-called resting functional connectivity (RFC). There is evidence that RFC is predictive of how the brain processes information during social tasks. This is important because it shifts the focus from possibly context-dependent aberrations to context-independent aberrations in functional network architecture. Rather than being analysed in isolation, the study of resting-state brain networks shows promise in linking results of task-based fMRI results, structural connectivity, molecular imaging findings, and performance measures of social cognition-which may prove crucial in furthering our understanding of the social brain.

However, the use of anesthetics to immobilize rodents during fMRI experiments has restricted the type of questions that can be addressed using this technique. Here we describe an innovative procedure to train rats to be constrained without the need of any anesthesia during the whole procedure. We show that with 8-10 days of acclimation rats can be conscious and remain still during fMRI experiments under minimal stress. In addition, we provide fMRI results of conscious rodents in a variety of commonly used fMRI experimental paradigms, and we demonstrate the improved quality of these scans by comparing results when the same rodents were scanned under anesthesia. We confirm that the awake scanning procedure permits an improved evaluation of brain networks and brain response to external stimuli with minimal movement artifact. The present study further advances the field of fMRI in awake rodents, which provide more direct, forward and reverse, translational opportunities regarding brain functional correspondences between human and rodent research.

Previous investigations commonly utilize a block paradigm to study sustained and transient changes in attention networks. fMRI investigations have shown that sustained attention in visual block design attention tasks corresponds to decreased signal in the default mode and visual processing networks. While task negative networks are anticipated to decrease during active task engagement, it is unexpected that visual networks would also be suppressed during a visual task where event-related fMRI studies have found transient increases to visual stimuli. To resolve these competing results, the current investigations utilized intracranial EEG to directly interrogate visual and default mode network dynamics during a visual continuous performance task. We used the electrophysiological data to model expected fMRI signals and to maximize interpretation of current results with previous investigations. Results show broadband gamma power decreases in the default mode network, corresponding to previous EEG and fMRI findings. Meanwhile, visual processing regions including the primary visual cortex and fusiform gyrus demonstrate both sustained decreases during task engagement and stimuli-driven transient increases in gamma power. Modeled fMRI based on gamma power reproduces signal decreases reported in the fMRI literature, and emphasizes the insensitivity of fMRI to transient, regularly spaced signal changes embedded within sustained network dynamics. The signal processing functions of the dynamic visual and default mode network changes explored in this study are unknown but may be elucidated through further investigation.

It allows displaying brain damages that can be quantified and linked to neurobehavioral deficits. fMRI can potentially draw a new cartography of brain functional areas, allow us to understand aspects of brain function evolution or even breach the wall into cognition and consciousness. However, fMRI is not deprived of pitfalls, such as limitation in spatial resolution, poor reproducibility, different time scales of fMRI measurements and neuron action potentials, low statistical values. Thus, caution is needed in the assessment of fMRI results and conclusions. Additional diagnostic techniques based on MRI such as arterial spin labeling (ASL) and the measurement of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provide new tools to assess normal brain development or disruption of anatomical networks in diseases. A cutting edge of recent research uses fMRI techniques to establish a "map" of neural connections in the brain, or "connectome". It will help to develop a map of neural connections and thus understand the operation of the network. New applications combining fMRI and real time visualization of one's own brain activity (rtfMRl) could empower individuals to modify brain response and thus could enable researchers or institutions to intervene in the modification of an individual behavior. The latter in particular, as well as the concern about the confidentiality and storage of sensitive information or fMRI and lie detectors forensic use, raises new ethical questions.

However, how exactly optogenetic activation or inhibition reproduces normal physiological input has not been fully unraveled. To assess details of temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response, temporal resolution in rodent fMRI is often not sufficient. Recent advances in human fMRI using faster acquisition schemes cannot be easily translated to small animals due to smaller dimensions, fast physiological motion, and higher sensitivity to artefacts. Here, we applied a one dimensional line scanning acquisition with 50 ms temporal resolution in rat somatosensory cortex. We observed that optogenetic activation reproduces the hemodynamic response upon sensory stimulation, but shows a 160 to 340 ms earlier onset of the response. This difference is explained by direct activation of all opsin-expressing and illuminated cortical layers, while hemodynamic response to sensory stimulation is delayed during intracortical transmission between cortical layers. Our results confirm that optogenetic activation is a valid model for physiological neuronal input, and that differences in temporal behavior of only a few hundred milliseconds can be resolved in rodent fMRI.

Invalidation of fMRI Experiments Secondary to Neurovascular Uncoupling in Patients With Cerebrovascular Disease	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article							ACHILLES TENDONS; T2-ASTERISK ANALYSIS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; IN-VIVO; 7 TESLA; CARTILAGE; RELAXATION; HEALTHY; MRI; REPRODUCIBILITY	Purpose: Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique used to infer neuronal activity from the observed changes in blood flow. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is the ability of arterioles to increase blood flow in response to vasodilatory stimulus. We hypothesize that in areas of disease where there is exhausted vascular reserve and impaired CVR there will be diminished blood flow response following neuronal activation, and that these areas would appear as false-negative tests on BOLD fMRI. Materials and Methods: Patients with steno-occlusive disease and unilateral hemodynamic impairment received a standardized hypercapnic stimuli while being imaged with BOLD fMRI to generate CVR maps. These were compared to traditional BOLD fMRI maps of neuronal activation in the motor cortex in response to a motor task. Results: Neuronal activation from the motor task was found to be linearly correlated with CVR (n511 patients, R50.82). Regions with positive (normal) CVR showed positive activation on BOLD fMRI, while regions with negative CVR had attenuated neuronal activation on BOLD fMRI. Conclusion: In areas with cerebrovascular disease where CVR is impaired, there is uncoupling of neuronal activation and blood flow that confounds traditional BOLD fMRI. CVR mapping is a noninvasive MRI-based imaging technique that can provide information about the vascular reactivity of the brain that is important to consider when interpreting traditional BOLD fMRI studies.

Inter-subject phase synchronization for exploratory analysis of task-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Exploratory fMRI; Brain synchronization; Inter-subject correlation; Instantaneous phase analysis; General linear model; Task fMRI	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; BRAINS DEFAULT NETWORK; MOTION; CORTEX; FLUCTUATIONS; ACTIVATION; HYPOTHESIS	Analysis of task-based fMRI data is conventionally carried out using a hypothesis-driven approach, where blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) time courses are correlated with a hypothesized temporal structure. In some experimental designs, this temporal structure can be difficult to define. In other cases, experimenters may wish to take a more exploratory, data-driven approach to detecting task-driven BOLD activity. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency and power of an inter-subject synchronization approach for exploratory analysis of task-based fMRI data. Combining the tools of instantaneous phase synchronization and independent component analysis, we characterize whole-brain task-driven responses in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this framework to fMRI data collected during performance of a simple motor task and a social cognitive task. Analyses using an inter-subject phase synchronization approach revealed a large number of brain networks that dynamically synchronized to various features of the task, often not predicted by the hypothesized temporal structure of the task. We suggest that this methodological framework, along with readily available tools in the fMRI community, provides a powerful exploratory, data-driven approach for analysis of task-driven BOLD activity.

Cortical depth (i.e., laminar) contrast responses have been studied in monkey early visual cortex, but not in humans. In addition to the high spatial resolution needed and the ensuing low signal-to-noise ratio, laminar studies in humans using fMRI are hampered by the strong venous vascular weighting of the fMRI signal. In this study, we measured luminance contrast responses in human V1 and V2 with high-resolution fMRI at 7 T. To account for the effect of intracortical ascending veins, we applied a novel spatial deconvolution model to the fMRI depth profiles. Before spatial deconvolution, the contrast response in V1 showed a slight local maximum at mid cortical depth, whereas V2 exhibited a monotonic signal increase toward the cortical surface. After applying the deconvolution, both V1 and V2 showed a pronounced local maximum at mid cortical depth, with an additional peak in deep grey matter, especially in V1. Moreover, we found a difference in contrast sensitivity between V1 and V2, but no evidence for variations in contrast sensitivity as a function of cortical depth. These findings are in agreement with results obtained in nonhuman primates, but further research will be needed to validate the spatial deconvolution approach.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) is currently a technique used in research in both healthy individuals as well as patients. EEG and fMRI are procedures used to obtain direct and indirect measurements of brain neural activity: EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp, and fMRI detects the changes in blood oxygenation that occur in response to neural activity. EEG has a high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution, while fMRI has high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution. Thus, the combination of EEG with rs-fMRI using different methods could be very useful for research and clinical applications. In this article, we describe and show the results of a new methodology for processing rs-fMRI using seeds positioned according to the 10-10 EEG standard. We analyze the functional connectivity and adjacency matrices obtained using 65 seeds based on 10-10 EEG scheme and 21 seeds based on 10-20 EEG. Connectivity networks are created using each 10-20 EEG seeds and are analyzed by comparisons to the seven networks that have been found in recent studies. The proposed method captures high correlation between contralateral seeds, ipsilateral and contralateral occipital seeds, and some in the frontal lobe.

Presurgical language fMRI: Technical practices in epilepsy surgical planning	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						clinical; epilepsy; fMRI; language; presurgical	BRAIN	Little is known about how language functional MRI (fMRI) is executed in clinical practice in spite of its widespread use. Here we comprehensively documented its execution in surgical planning in epilepsy. A questionnaire focusing on cognitive design, image acquisition, analysis and interpretation, and practical considerations was developed. Individuals responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting clinical language fMRI data at 63 epilepsy surgical programs responded. The central finding was of marked heterogeneity in all aspects of fMRI. Most programs use multiple tasks, with a fifth routinely using 2, 3, 4, or 5 tasks with a modal run duration of 5 min. Variants of over 15 protocols are in routine use with forms of noun-verb generation, verbal fluency, and semantic decision-making used most often. Nearly all aspects of data acquisition and analysis vary markedly. Neither of the two best-validated protocols was used by more than 10% of respondents. Preprocessing steps are broadly consistent across sites, language-related blood flow is most often identified using general linear modeling (76% of respondents), and statistical thresholding typically varies by patient (79%). The software SPM is most often used. fMRI programs inconsistently include input from experts with all required skills (imaging, cognitive assessment, MR physics, statistical analysis, and brain-behavior relationships). These data highlight marked gaps between the evidence supporting fMRI and its clinical application. Teams performing language fMRI may benefit from evaluating practice with reference to the best-validated protocols to date and ensuring individuals trained in all aspects of fMRI are involved to optimize patient care.

Adaptive Smoothing Based on Gaussian Processes Regression Increases the Sensitivity and Specificity of fMRI Data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						fMRI smoothing; Gaussian processes regression; denoising; retinotopic mapping; classification; visual cortex; early visual areas; multivoxel pattern analysis; searchlight	CORTICAL THICKNESS ANALYSIS; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; TASK-BASED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; RANDOM-FIELDS; HUMAN BRAIN; 7 T; AREAS; ACTIVATION	Temporal and spatial filtering of fMRI data is often used to improve statistical power. However, conventional methods, such as smoothing with fixed-width Gaussian filters, remove fine-scale structure in the data, necessitating a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, smoothing may increase sensitivity (reduce noise and increase statistical power) but at the cost loss of specificity in that fine-scale structure in neural activity patterns is lost. Here, we propose an alternative smoothing method based on Gaussian processes (GP) regression for single subjects fMRI experiments. This method adapts the level of smoothing on a voxel by voxel basis according to the characteristics of the local neural activity patterns. GP-based fMRI analysis has been heretofore impractical owing to computational demands. Here, we demonstrate a new implementation of GP that makes it possible to handle the massive data dimensionality of the typical fMRI experiment. We demonstrate how GP can be used as a drop-in replacement to conventional preprocessing steps for temporal and spatial smoothing in a standard fMRI pipeline. We present simulated and experimental results that show the increased sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional smoothing strategies. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods In this prospective case series, 17 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had intracranial monitoring and resection from 2012 to 2016 with 1-year follow-up. All patients completed preoperative language fMRI, mapping with DCS of subdural electrodes, pre- and postoperative neuropsychological testing for language function, and resection. Changes in language function before and after surgery were assessed. fMRI activation and DCS electrodes in the resection were evaluated as potential predictors of language decline. Results Four of 17 patients (12 female; median [range] age, 43 [23-59] years) experienced postoperative language decline 1 year after surgery. Two of 4 patients had overlap of fMRI activation, language-positive electrodes in basal temporal regions (within 1 cm), and resection.

When fMRI and DCS language findings were concordant, the combined tests showed 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity for language outcome.

Changes in behaviors after real-time fMRI neurofeedback are postulated to be caused by neural plasticity driven by the induction of specific targeted activities at the neuronal level (targeted neural plasticity model). However, some research groups argued that behavioral changes in conventional real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies are explained by alternative accounts, including the placebo effect and physiological artifacts. Recently, decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) has been developed as a result of adapting new technological advancements, including implicit neurofeedback and fMRI multivariate analyses. DecNef provides strong evidence for the targeted neural plasticity model while refuting the abovementioned alternative accounts. In this review, we first discuss how DecNef refutes the alternative accounts. Second, we propose a model that shows how targeted neural plasticity occurs at the neuronal level during DecNef training. Finally, we discuss computational and empirical evidence that supports the model. Clarification of the neural mechanisms of DecNef would lead to the development of more advanced fMRI neurofeedback methods that may serve as powerful tools for both basic and clinical research.

Interpreting Intervention Induced Neuroplasticity with fMRI: The Case for Multimodal Imaging Strategies	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE FUNCTION; CHRONIC STROKE PATIENTS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; MOTOR RECOVERY; CONGENITAL HEMIPARESIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TRANSCALLOSAL INHIBITION; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION	Direct measurement of recovery from brain injury is an important goal in neurorehabilitation, and requires reliable, objective, and interpretable measures of changes in brain function, referred to generally as "neuroplasticity." One popular imaging modality for measuring neuroplasticity is task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (t-fMRI). In the field of neurorehabilitation, however, assessing neuroplasticity using t-fMRI presents a significant challenge. This commentary reviews t-fMRI changes commonly reported in patients with cerebral palsy or acquired brain injuries, with a focus on studies of motor rehabilitation, and discusses complexities surrounding their interpretations. Specifically, we discuss the difficulties in interpreting t-fMRI changes in terms of their underlying causes, that is, differentiating whether they reflect genuine reorganisation, neurological restoration, compensation, use of preexisting redundancies, changes in strategy, or maladaptive processes. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of heterogeneous disease states and essential t-fMRI processing steps on the interpretability of activation patterns. To better understand therapy-induced neuroplastic changes, we suggest that researchers utilising t-fMRI consider concurrently acquiring information from an additional modality, to quantify, for example, haemodynamic differences or microstructural changes. We outline a variety of such supplementary measures for investigating brain reorganisation and discuss situations in which they may prove beneficial to the interpretation of t-fMRI data.

However, as the fMRI blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is a vascular signal, the spatial specificity of fMRI data is ultimately determined by the characteristics of the underlying vasculature. At 7 T, fMRI measurement parameters determine the relative contribution of the macro- and microvasculature to the acquired signal. Here we investigate how these parameters affect relevant high-end fMRI analyses such as encoding, decoding, and submillimeter mapping of voxel preferences in the human auditory cortex. Specifically, we compare a T-2* weighted fMRI dataset, obtained with 2D gradient echo (GE) EPI, to a predominantly T-2 weighted dataset obtained with 3D GRASE. We first investigated the decoding accuracy based on two encoding models that represented different hypotheses about auditory cortical processing. This encoding/decoding analysis profited from the large spatial coverage and sensitivity of the T-2* weighted acquisitions, as evidenced by a significantly higher prediction accuracy in the GE-EPI dataset compared to the 3D GRASE dataset for both encoding models. The main disadvantage of the T-2* weighted GE-EPI dataset for encoding/decoding analyses was that the prediction accuracy exhibited cortical depth dependent vascular biases. However, we propose that the comparison of prediction accuracy across the different encoding models may be used as a post processing technique to salvage the spatial interpretability of the GE-EPI cortical depth-dependent prediction accuracy. Second, we explored the mapping of voxel preferences. Large-scale maps of frequency preference (i.e., tonotopy) were similar across datasets, yet the GE-EPI dataset was preferable due to its larger spatial coverage and sensitivity. However, submillimeter tonotopy maps revealed biases in assigned frequency preference and selectivity for the GE-EPI dataset, but not for the 3D GRASE dataset. Thus, a T-2 weighted acquisition is recommended if high specificity in tonotopic maps is required. In conclusion, different fMRI acquisitions were better suited for different analyses. It is therefore critical that any sequence parameter optimization considers the eventual intended fMRI analyses and the nature of the neuroscience questions being asked.

However, the specificity of this activation to semantic unification remains unknown. To more closely examine the brain processes involved in semantic unification, we employed simultaneous EEG-fMRI to time-lock the semantic unification related N400 change, and integrated trial-by-trial variation in both N400 and BOLD change beyond the condition-level BOLD change difference measured in traditional fMRI analyses. Participants read sentences in which semantic unification load was parametrically manipulated by varying doze probability. Separately, ERP and fMRI results replicated previous findings, in that semantic unification load parametrically modulated the amplitude of N400 and cortical activation. Integrated EEG-fMRI analyses revealed a different pattern in which functional activity in the left IFG and bilateral supramarginal gyrus (SMG) was associated with N400 amplitude, with the left IFG activation and bilateral SMG activation being selective to the condition level and trial-level of semantic unification load, respectively. By employing the EEG-fMRI integrated analyses, this study among the first sheds light on how to integrate trial-level variation in language comprehension.

Examples for using this Big Data platform in graph analysis of fMRI datasets are shown to illustrate how processing pipelines employing it can be developed. With more tools for the convenient integration of neuroimaging file formats and typical processing steps, big data technologies could find wider endorsement in the community, leading to a range of potentially useful applications especially in view of the current collaborative creation of a wealth of large data repositories including thousands of individual fMRI datasets.

It is a technique for brain imaging that, according to advocates, provides information about which areas of the brain are activated during organizational processes (e.g., leadership and decision-making). In this article, we take a critical look at this tool from a technical perspective. In particular, we take the reader through the assumptions that must be made at the three main steps of the research process (study design, data capture, and interpretation of results) in order to draw conclusions about organizational phenomena from fMRI research. Applying this analysis to three case studies demonstrates the gap between what fMRI can actually tell us and the claims often made about the contribution of fMRI to understanding and improving organizational behavior. Our discussion provides researchers with a series of recommendations oriented toward optimizing the use of fMRI to help it live up to its potential in the field of organizational behavior and consumers with a means of evaluating fMRI research in order to draw appropriate and warranted conclusions.

For instance, different layers compartmentalize different cell types, synaptic activities, and have unique intrinsic and extrinsic connections that serve as units for specialized signal processing. Functional MRI is an invaluable tool to investigate laminar processing in the in vivo human brain, but it measures neuronal activity indirectly by way of the hemodynamic response. Therefore, the accuracy of high-resolution laminar fMRI depends on how precisely it can measure localized microvascular changes nearest to the site of evoked activity. To determine the specificity of fMRI responses to the true neurophysiological responses across layers, the flexibility to invasive procedures in animal models has been necessary. In this review, we will examine different fMRI contrasts and their appropriate uses for layer-specific fMRI, and how localized laminar processing was examined in the neocortex and olfactory bulb. Through collective efforts, it was determined that microvessels, including capillaries, are regulated within single layers and that several endogenous and contrast-enhanced fMRI contrast mechanisms can separate these neural-specific vascular changes from the nonspecific, especially cerebral blood volume-weighted fMRI with intravenous contrast agent injection. We will also propose some open questions that are relevant for the successful implementation of layer-specific fMRI and its potential future directions to study laminar processing when combined with optogenetics.

However, many toolboxes only cover a certain range of functions, and use exclusively designed GUIs. To facilitate data processing and alleviate the burden of manually drawing GUIs, we have developed a versatile and extendable MATLAB-based toolbox, BRANT (BRAinNetome fmri Toolkit), with a wide range of rs-fMRI data processing functions and code-generated GUIs. During the implementation, we have also empowered the toolbox with parallel computing techniques, efficient file handling methods for compressed file format, and one-line scripting. In BRANT, users can find rs-fMRI batch processing functions for preprocessing, brain spontaneous activity analysis, functional connectivity analysis, complex network analysis, statistical analysis, and results visualization, while developers can quickly publish scripts with code-generated GUIs.

Because using fMRI in patients with DOC is difficult, studies increasingly employ EEG. However, there has been no verification that these modalities provide converging information at the individual subject level. The present study examined simultaneous EEG and fMRI in healthy volunteers during six mental imagery tasks to determine whether one mental imagery task generates more robust activation across subjects; whether activation can be predicted from familiarity with the imagined activity; and whether EEG and fMRI converge upon the same conclusions about individual imagery performance. Mental arithmetic generated the most robust activation in the majority of subjects for both EEG and fMRI, and level of activation could not be predicted from familiarity, with either modality. We conclude that overall, EEG and fMRI agree regarding individual mental imagery performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate fMRI test-retest reliability in dementia patients and typical older adults using noun and verb confrontation naming to evaluate the validity of using a single pre/post-treatment scan comparison. Seven individuals with dementia and 9 control participants were tested three times over two months using the same fMRI procedures. Differences in individual and group level activation patterns were observed that varied across time. Additionally, the extent of variability fluctuated across individuals, groups, and the grammatical category of target words. Our findings suggested that one time fMRI scanning may inadequately represent an individual's typical brain activation pattern, particularly an individual with dementia. Thus, multiple imaging baselines are recommended.

Quantitative analysis tool for clinical functional MRI in mild traumatic brain injury	UNDERSEA AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; functional MRI; central auditory processing; clinical radiological interpretation; general linear modeling		Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been available commercially for clinical diagnostic use for many years. However, both clinical interpretation of fMRI by a neuroradiologist and quantitative analysis of fMRI data can require significant personnel resources that exceed reimbursement. In this report, a fully automated computer-based quantification methodology (Enumerated Auditory Response, EAR) has been developed to provide an auditory fMRI assessment of patients who have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury. Fifty-five study participants with interpretable auditory fMRI sequence data were assessed by EAR analysis, as well as both clinical radiologist fMRI interpretation and voxelwise general linear model (GLM) analysis. Comparison between the clinical interpretation and the two computer analysis methods resulted in 67% concordance (identical), 32% near-concordance (one level difference), and 1% discordant. Comparison between the clinical computer-based quantification (EAR) and GLM analysis yielded significant correlations in right and left ear responses (p<0.05) for the full subject group. Automated fMRI quantification analysis equivalent to EAR might be appropriate for both future research projects with constrained resources, as well as possible routine clinical use.

As such, the development of novel treatments is urgently needed. Unfortunately, the costs associated with high failure rates for investigational compounds as they enter clinical trials has led to pharmaceutical companies downsizing or eliminating research programs needed to develop these drugs. One way of increasing the probability of success for investigational compounds is to incorporate alternative methods of identifying biological targets in order to more effectively screen new drugs. A promising method of accomplishing this goal for psychiatric drugs is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI investigates neural circuits, shedding light on the biology that generates symptoms such as hallucinations. Once identified, relevant neural circuits can be targeted with pharmacologic interventions and the response to these drugs measured with fMRI. This review describes the early use of fMRI in this context, and discusses the alpha7 nicotinic receptor agonist 3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene) anabaseine (DMXB-A), as an example of the potential value of fMRI for psychiatric drug development.

However, multiple technical considerations (ranging from specifics of paradigm design to imaging artifacts, complex protocol definition, and multitude of processing and methods of analysis, as well as intrinsic methodological limitations) must be considered and addressed in order to optimize fMRI analysis and to arrive at the most accurate and grounded interpretation of the data. In practice, the researcher/clinician must choose, from many available options, the most suitable software tool for each stage of the fMRI analysis pipeline. Herein we provide a straightforward guide designed to address, for each of the major stages, the techniques, and tools involved in the process. We have developed this guide both to help those new to the technique to overcome the most critical difficulties in its use, as well as to serve as a resource for the neuroimaging community.

The simplicity and speed of executionmake rs-fMRI applicable in a variety of normal and pathological conditions. Since it does not require any task, rs-fMRI is particularly useful for protocols on patients, children, and elders, increasing participant's compliance and reducing intersubjective variability due to the task performance. rs-fMRI has shown high sensitivity in identification of RSNs modifications in several diseases also in absence of structural modifications. In this narrative review, we provide the state of the art of rs-fMRI studies about physiological and pathological aging processes. First, we introduce the background of resting state; then we review clinical findings provided by rs-fMRI in physiological aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer Dementia (AD), and Late Life Depression (LLD). Finally, we suggest future directions in this field of research and its potential clinical applications.

However, acceleration of rodent brain fMRI using parallel and simultaneous multi-slice imaging techniques is hampered by the lack of high-density phased-array coils for the small brain. To overcome this limitation, we adapted phase-offset multiplanar and blipped-controlled aliasing echo planar imaging (EPI) to enable simultaneous multi-slice fMRI of the mouse brain using a single loop coil on a 9.4T scanner. Four slice bands of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.5 mm(3) resolution can be simultaneously acquired to cover the whole brain at a temporal resolution of 300 ms or the whole cerebrum in 150 ms. Instead of losing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), both spatial and temporal SNR can be increased due to the increased k-space sampling compared to a standard single-band EPI. Task fMRI using a visual stimulation shows close to 80% increase of z-score and 4 times increase of activated area in the visual cortex using the multiband EPI due to the highly increased temporal samples. Resting-state fMRI shows reliable detection of bilateral connectivity by both single-band and multiband EPI, but no significant difference was found. Without the need of a dedicated hardware, we have demonstrated a practical method that can enable unparallelly fast whole-brain fMRI for preclinical studies. This technique can be used to increase sensitivity, distinguish transient response or acquire high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI.

METHODS: We reviewed the reported data and performed a meta-analysis of studies that had validated fMRI using DCS and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We performed the meta-analysis of the studies that had met our inclusion criteria. The positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), false omission rates (FORs), false discovery rates (FDRs), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. We also identified the factors that could influence the fMRI findings. RESULTS: Six studies of language activation and two of motor activation were eligible for the present meta-analysis. The PPV of fMRI for the detection of eloquent motor cortex was 59.5%, and the FDR was 40.5%. The NPV was 96% and the FOR was 3.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of fMRI for the detection of the eloquent motor cortex was 91% and 76%, respectively. For language activation, the PPV was 71.7%, the NPV was 80%, the FDR was 28.2%, and the FOR was 19.5%. The sensitivity and specificity was 80% and 71.5%, respectively. The factors that could have caused a mismatch or affected the reliability were analyzed. CONCLUSION: The results from the present analysis of the available reported evidence suggest that fMRI itself (due to neurovascular uncoupling) or analysis of the findings have limitations regarding reliability when validated against DCS. From the existing studies, our results indicate that using fMRI alone for surgical planning could lead to undesirable outcomes.

Specifically, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which allows the assessment of the vascular response that serves as the basis for fMRI, has been shown to be reduced in healthy aging aswell as in a range of diseases, including chronic stroke. However, the timing ofwhen this occurs relative to the stroke event is unclear. We used a breath-hold fMRI task to evaluate CVR across gray matter in a group of acute stroke patients (<10 days from stroke; N = 22) to address this question. These estimates were compared with those from both age-matched (N = 22) and younger (N = 22) healthy controls. As expected, young controls had the greatest mean CVR, as indicated by magnitude and extent of fMRI activation; however, stroke patients did not differ fromage-matched controls. Moreover, the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres of stroke patients did not differ with respect to any of these measures. These findings suggest that fMRI remains a valid tool within the first few days of a stroke, particularly for group fMRI studies in which findings are compared with healthy subjects of similar age. However, given the relatively high variability in CVR observed in our stroke sample, caution is warranted when interpreting fMRI data from individual patients or a small cohort. We conclude that a breath-hold task can be a useful addition to functional imaging protocols for stroke patients. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

How to reduce the size of fMRI data but not lose much information becomes a more and more pressing issue. Recent literature studies tried to deal with it by dictionary learning and sparse representation methods, however, their computation complexities are still high, which hampers the wider application of sparse representation method to large scale fMRI datasets. To effectively address this problem, this work proposes to represent resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals of a whole brain via a statistical sampling based sparse representation. First we sampled the whole brain's signals via different sampling methods, then the sampled signals were aggregate into an input data matrix to learn a dictionary, finally this dictionary was used to sparsely represent the whole brain's signals and identify the resting state networks. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed signal sampling framework can speed-up by ten times in reconstructing concurrent brain networks without losing much information. The experiments on the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project further demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.

Although many networks appear modular and specific, global and nonspecific fMRI fluctuations also exist and both pose a challenge and present an opportunity for characterizing and understanding brain networks. Here, we used a multimodal approach to investigate the neural correlates to the global fMRI signal in the resting state. Like fMRI, resting-state power fluctuations of broadband and arrhythmic, or scale-free, macaque electrocorticography and human magnetoencephalography activity were correlated globally. The power fluctuations of scale-free human electroencephalography (EEG) were coupled with the global component of simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI, with the global hemodynamic change lagging the broadband spectral change of EEG by similar to 5 s. The levels of global and nonspecific fluctuation and synchronization in scale-free population activity also varied across and depended on arousal states. Together, these results suggest that the neural origin of global resting-state fMRI activity is the broadband power fluctuation in scale-free population activity observable with macroscopic electrical or magnetic recordings. Moreover, the global fluctuation in neurophysiological and hemodynamic activity is likely modulated through diffuse neuromodulation pathways that govern arousal states and vigilance levels.

Accurate autocorrelation modeling substantially improves fMRI reliability	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION; TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION; CLUSTER FAILURE; SPATIAL EXTENT; BRAIN; INFERENCES; DESIGN; NOISE	Given the recent controversies in some neuroimaging statistical methods, we compare the most frequently used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analysis packages: AFNI, FSL and SPM, with regard to temporal autocorrelation modeling. This process, sometimes known as pre-whitening, is conducted in virtually all task fMRI studies. Here, we employ eleven datasets containing 980 scans corresponding to different fMRI protocols and subject populations. We found that autocorrelation modeling in AFNI, although imperfect, performed much better than the autocorrelation modeling of FSL and SPM. The presence of residual autocorrelated noise in FSL and SPM leads to heavily confounded first level results, particularly for low-frequency experimental designs. SPM's alternative pre-whitening method, FAST, performed better than SPM's default. The reliability of task fMRI studies could be improved with more accurate autocorrelation modeling. We recommend that fMRI analysis packages provide diagnostic plots to make users aware of any pre-whitening problems.

Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n = 9; 5 male) completed two 20-min rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1 Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain similar to 2.2% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-min rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n = 5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R-2* decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e., blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.

Using large-scale connectivity and graph-theoretical analyses of task-based magnetoencephalography (MEG), we aimed to provide robust representations of receptive and expressive language processes, comparable with spatial profiles of corresponding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We examined MEG and fMRI data from 12 healthy young adults (age 20-37 years) completing covert auditory word-recognition task (WRT) and covert auditory verb-generation task (VGT). For MEG language mapping, broadband (3-30 Hz) beamformer sources were estimated, voxel-level connectivity was quantified using phase locking value, and highly connected hubs were characterized using eigenvector centrality graph measure. fMRI data were analyzed using a classic general linear model approach. A laterality index (LI) was computed for 20 language-specific frontotemporal regions for both MEG and fMRI. MEG network analysis showed bilateral and symmetrically distributed hubs within the left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) during WRT and predominant hubs in left inferior prefrontal gyrus (IFG) during VGT. MEG and fMRI localization maps showed high correlation values within frontotemporal regions during WRT and VGT (r = 0.63, 0.74, q < 0.05, respectively). Despite good concordance in localization, notable discordances were observed in lateralization between MEG and fMRI. During WRT, MEG favored a left-hemispheric dominance of left STG (LI = 0.25 +/- 0.22) whereas fMRI supported a bilateral representation of STG (LI = 0.08 +/- 0.2). Laterality of MEG and fMRI during VGT consistently showed a strong asymmetry in left IFG regions (MEG-LI = 0.45 +/- 0.35 and fMRI-LI = 0.46 +/- 0.13). Our results demonstrate the utility of a large-scale connectivity and graph theoretical analyses for robust identification of language-specific regions. MEG hubs are in great agreement with the literature in revealing with canonical and extra-canonical language sites, thus providing additional support for the underlying topological organization of receptive and expressive language cortices. Discordances in lateralization may emphasize the need for multimodal integration of MEG and fMRI to obtain an excellent predictive value in a heterogeneous healthy population and patients with neurosurgical conditions.

J	Abreu, R; Nunes, S; Leal, A; Figueiredo, P				Abreu, Rodolfo; Nunes, Sandro; Leal, Alberto; Figueiredo, Patricia			Physiological noise correction using ECG-derived respiratory signals for enhanced mapping of spontaneous neuronal activity with simultaneous EEG-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Physiological noise; Epilepsy; Resting-state; Default mode network; ECG-derived respiratory signal	RESTING-STATE FMRI; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION; MOTION CORRECTION; RESPONSE FUNCTION; COMBINING EEG	The study of spontaneous brain activity based on BOLD-fMRI may be seriously compromised by the presence of signal fluctuations of non-neuronal origin, most prominently due to cardiac and respiratory mechanisms. Methods used for modeling and correction of the so-called physiological noise usually rely on the concurrent measurement of cardiac and respiratory signals. In simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings, which are primarily aimed at the study of spontaneous brain activity, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically measured as part of the EEG setup but respiratory data are not generally available. Here, we propose to use the ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signal estimated by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) as a surrogate of the respiratory signal, for retrospective physiological noise correction of typical simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. A physiological noise model based on these physiological signals (P-PNM) complemented with fMRI-derived noise regressors was generated, and evaluated, for 17 simultaneous EEG-fMRI datasets acquired from a group of seven epilepsy patients imaged at 3 T. The respiratory components of P-PNM were found to explain BOLD variance significantly in addition to the cardiac components, suggesting that the EDR signal was successfully extracted from the ECG, and P-PNM outperformed an image-based model (I-PNM) in terms of total BOLD variance explained. Further, the impact of the correction using P-PNM on fMRI mapping of patient-specific epileptic networks and the resting-state default mode network (DMN) was assessed in terms of sensitivity and specificity and, when compared with an ICA-based procedure and a standard pre-processing pipeline, P-PNM achieved the best performance. Overall, our results support the feasibility and utility of extracting physiological noise models of the BOLD signal resorting to ECG data exclusively, with substantial impact on the simultaneous EEG-fMRI mapping of resting-state networks, and, most importantly, epileptic networks where sensitivity and specificity are still limited.

Language function shows comparable cortical patterns by functional MRI and repetitive nTMS in healthy volunteers	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Action naming; Functional MRI; Object naming; Pseudoword reading; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NEURAL SUBSTRATE; SPEECH ARREST; NAMING ERRORS; BRAIN; MOTOR; FMRI; WORD; VERB; CORTEX	In preoperative planning, fMRI and repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) repeatedly revealed differences in the detected language sites, which can be attributed to tumor-induced oxygenation changes impairing the accuracy of fMRI. We therefore compared the accordance of those techniques in healthy subjects using exactly the same tasks in both investigations. 19 healthy right-handed subjects performed object naming, pseudoword reading, verb generation, and action naming during fMRI at 3T and rTMS. For rTMS language mapping, we stimulated 46 cortical spots over the left hemisphere; each site was stimulated for three times. Language positive points during rTMS for one, two, or three errors out the three stimulations per spot (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) were exported via DICOM, and compared to the positive fMRI clusters. As a result of this comparison, the best correlation was observed between 3/3 errors and fMRI for pseudoword reading and verb generation with t-values of p(u)<0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, on average across the whole rTMS-spot map. We found a close spatial agreement between several rTMS-spots (2/3 and 3/3 errors) and fMRI clusters accentuated in the frontal lobe, followed by the parietal lobe and less in the temporal lobe. Compared to the fMRI clusters, there was a higher congruence for 2/3 and 3/3 errors than for 1/3 errors. Overall, results of language mapping in healthy subjects by fMRI and rTMS correspond well yet depending on the used language task.

Resting-state fMRI data reflects default network activity rather than null data: A defense of commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						fMRI; default network; clusterwise inference; false cluster; false positive; familywise error; multiple comparisons; type I error	MEMORY	Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data typically involves over one hundred thousand independent statistical tests; therefore, it is necessary to correct for multiple comparisons to control familywise error. In a recent paper, Eklund, Nichols, and Knutsson used resting-state fMRI data to evaluate commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons and reported unacceptable rates of familywise error. Eklund et al.'s analysis was based on the assumption that resting-state fMRI data reflect null data; however, their null data' actually reflected default network activity that inflated familywise error. As such, Eklund et al.'s results provide no basis to question the validity of the thousands of published fMRI studies that have corrected for multiple comparisons or the commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons.

Group independent component analysis (ICA) is applied to the magnitude and phase data separately. We then compare the spatial patterns for both magnitude and phase data using an empirical spatial smoothing procedure. We also evaluate the magnitude and phase functional network connectivity (FC) matrices. Results: We observed the positive/negative correlation-balanced functional connectivity in phase data, which is distinct from the positive correlation prevalence in magnitude data. The phase FC (pFC) structure is quite different from the magnitude FC (mFC) in functional clusters (on-diagonal blocks or cliques) and inter-cluster couplings (off-diagonal blocks). Comparison with existing: Methods since both the magnitude and phase data of the fMRI signals are generated from the same magnetic source, either can be useful for brain function analysis from different perspective (per different measurements). Herein, we report on making use of resting-state fMRI phase data for brain functional analysis in comparison with magnitude data. This exploration in phase fMRI may provide a new arena for more comprehensive brain function analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intracortical smoothing of small-voxel fMRI data can provide increased detection power without spatial resolution losses compared to conventional large-voxel fMRI data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI analysis; High-resolution fMRI; Spatial smoothing; Surface-based analysis; Physiological noise; Cortical depth analysis; Laminar fMRI; Columnar fMRI	CORTICAL SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; 7 T; ANALYSIS STRATEGIES; ACQUISITION; VOLUME; ACCURATE; IMPACT	Continued improvement in MRI acquisition technology has made functional MRI (fMRI) with small isotropic voxel sizes down to 1 mm and below more commonly available. Although many conventional fMRI studies seek to investigate regional patterns of cortical activation for which conventional voxel sizes of 3 mm and larger provide sufficient spatial resolution, smaller voxels can help avoid contamination from adjacent white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and thereby increase the specificity of fMRI to signal changes within the gray matter. Unfortunately, temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), a metric of fMRI sensitivity, is reduced in high-resolution acquisitions, which offsets the benefits of small voxels. Here we introduce a framework that combines small, isotropic fMRI voxels acquired at 7 T field strength with a novel anatomically-informed, surface mesh-navigated spatial smoothing that can provide both higher detection power and higher resolution than conventional voxel sizes. Our smoothing approach uses a family of intracortical surface meshes and allows for kernels of various shapes and sizes, including curved 3D kernels that adapt to and track the cortical folding pattern. Our goal is to restrict smoothing to the cortical gray matter ribbon and avoid noise contamination from CSF and signal dilution from WM via partial volume effects. We found that the intracortical kernel that maximizes tSNR does not maximize percent signal change (Delta S/S), and therefore the kernel configuration that optimizes detection power cannot be determined from tSNR considerations alone. However, several kernel configurations provided a favorable balance between boosting tSNR and Delta S/S, and allowed a 1.1-mm isotropic fMRI acquisition to have higher performance after smoothing (in terms of both detection power and spatial resolution) compared to an unsmoothed 3.0-mm isotropic fMRI acquisition. Overall, the results of this study support the strategy of acquiring voxels smaller than the cortical thickness, even for studies not requiring high spatial resolution, and smoothing them down within the cortical ribbon with a kernel of an appropriate shape to achieve the best performance-thus decoupling the choice of fMRI voxel size from the spatial resolution requirements of the particular study. The improvement of this new intracortical smoothing approach over conventional surface-based smoothing is expected to be modest for conventional resolutions, however the improvement is expected to increase with higher resolutions. This framework can also be applied to anatomically-informed intracortical smoothing of higher-resolution data (e.g. along columns and layers) in studies with prior information about the spatial structure of activation.

Non-BOLD contrast for laminar fMRI in humans: CBF, CBV, and CMR<sub>O2</sub>	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review							CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; KETOGLUTARATE GLUTAMATE EXCHANGE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; CALIBRATED FUNCTIONAL MRI; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TIDAL CARBON-DIOXIDE; LAYER-DEPENDENT BOLD; SPIN-ECHO BOLD	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast indirectly probes neuronal activity changes via evoked cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) changes. The gradient-echo BOLD signal is mostly sensitive to ascending veins in the tissue and to pial veins. Thereby, the achievable spatial specificity to neuronal activation is limited. Furthermore, the non-linear interaction of CBF, CBV and CMRO2 can hamper quantitative interpretations of the BOLD signal across cortical depths with different baseline physiology. Measuring CBF, CBV or CMRO2 directly on a depth-dependent level has the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we review these candidates of physiologically well-defined contrasts with the particular focus on arterial spin labeling (ASL), vascular space occupancy (VASO) and calibrated fMRI. These methods are reviewed with respect to their fMRI sequence parameter space and the applicability for neuroscientific studies in humans. We show representative results of depth-dependent 'non-BOLD-fMRI' in humans and their spatiotemporal characteristics. We conclude that non-BOLD methods are promising alternatives compared to conventional fMRI as they can provide improved spatial specificity, quantifiability and, hence, physiological interpretability as a function of cortical depth. At submillimeter resolution with inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), however, their use is still challenging. Nevertheless, we believe that 'non-BOLD-fMRI' is a useful alternative for depth-dependent investigations, by providing valuable insights into neurovascular coupling models that facilitate the interpretability of fMRI for neuroscientific applications.

METHODSEleven ischemic stroke patients were examined by fMRI. The fMRI paradigm was based on passive ankle movement on both the healthy and the paretic leg's side. Three individual-level motion correction strategies were compared and we introduced five measures to characterize each subjects' in-scanner relative head movement. After analyzing the correlation of motion parameters and the subjects' physiological scale scores, we selected a parameter to model the motion-related artifacts in the second-level analysis. RESULTSAt first (individual) level analysis, the noise-component correction-based CompCor method provided the highest -log10(p) value of cluster-level occurrence probability at 12.4/13.6 for healthy and paretic side stimulus, respectively, with a maximal z-value of 15/16.3. Including the motion parameter at second (group) level resulted in lower cluster occurrence values at 10.9/5.55 while retaining the maximal z-value. CONCLUSIONSWe proposed a postprocessing pipeline for ischemic stroke fMRI data that combine the CompCor correction at first level with the modeling of motion effect at second-level analysis by a parameter obtained from fMRI data. Our solution is applicable for any fMRI-based stroke rehabilitation study since it does not require any MRI-compatible motion capture system and is based on commonly used methods.

Although efficient designs on these fMRI experiments are important for rendering precise statistical inference on brain functions, they are not systematically constructed. Design with circulant property is crucial for estimating a hemo-dynamic response function (HRF) and discussing fMRI experimental optimality. In this paper, we develop a theory that not only successfully explains the structure of a circulant design, but also provides a method of constructing efficient fMRI designs systematically. We further provide a class of two-level circulant designs with good performance (statistically optimal), and they can be used to estimate the HRF of a stimulus type and study the comparison of two HRFs. Some efficient three-and four-levels circulant designs are also provided, and we proved the existence of a class of circulant orthogonal arrays.

Clinical benefit of presurgical EEG-fMRI in difficult-to-localize focal epilepsy: A single-institution retrospective review	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						EEG; epilepsy surgery; fMRI; focal epilepsy	LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROME; SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FRONTAL-LOBE; NETWORK; RESPONSES; SURGERY; VALIDATION; ACTIVATION	Objective The aim of this report is to present our clinical experience of electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) in localizing the epileptogenic focus, and to evaluate the clinical impact and challenges associated with the use of EEG-fMRI in pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Methods We identified EEG-fMRI studies (n = 118) in people with focal epilepsy performed at our center from 2003 to 2018. Participants were referred from our Comprehensive Epilepsy Program in an exploratory research effort to address often difficult clinical questions, due to complex and difficult-to-localize epilepsy. We assessed the success of each study, the clinical utility of the result, and when surgery was performed, the postoperative outcome. Results Overall, 50% of EEG-fMRI studies were successful, meaning that data were of good quality and interictal epileptiform discharges were recorded. With an altered recruitment strategy since 2012 with increased inclusion of patients who were inpatients for video-EEG monitoring, we found that this patients in this selected group were more likely to have epileptic discharges detected during EEG-fMRI (96% of inpatients vs 29% of outpatients, P<.0001). To date, 48% (57 of 118) of patients have undergone epilepsy surgery. In 10 cases (17% of the 59 successful studies) the EEG-fMRI result had a "critical impact" on the surgical decision. These patients were difficult to localize because of subtle abnormalities, apparently normal MRI, or extensive structural abnormalities. All 10 had a good seizure outcome at 1 year after surgery (mean follow-up 6.5 years). Significance EEG-fMRI results can assist identification of the epileptogenic focus in otherwise difficult-to-localize cases of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Surgery determined largely by localization from the EEG-fMRI result can lead to good seizure outcomes. A limitation of this study is its retrospective design with nonconsecutive recruitment. Prospective clinical trials with well-defined inclusion criteria are needed to determine the overall benefit of EEG-fMRI for preoperative localization and postoperative outcome in focal epilepsy.

Multi-phase passband balanced SSFP fMRI with 50 ms sampling rate at 7 Tesla enables high precision in resolving 100 ms neuronal events	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Balanced SSFP (b-SSFP); Event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI); 50 ms sampling rate; 7 Tesla; Event-related potential (ERP)	STATE FREE PRECESSION; SPIN-ECHO FMRI; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL MRI; NEGATIVE RESPONSE; GRADIENT-ECHO; WHOLE-BRAIN; BLOOD-FLOW; RESOLUTION; SIGNAL	Passband balanced steady state free precession (b-SSFP) fMRI employs the flat portion of the SSFP off-resonance response to obtain microscopic susceptibility changes elicited by changes in blood oxygenation following enhancement in neuronal activity. This technique can reduce geometric distortion and signal dropout while maintaining rapid acquisition and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with traditional fMRI techniques. In the study, we developed a novel multi-phase passband b-SSFP fMRI technique that can achieve a spatial resolution of a few mm(3) and a high temporal sampling rate of 50 ms per slice at 7 Tesla. This technique was further applied for an event-related (ER) fMRI paradigm. As a comparison, gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) with similar spatial resolution and temporal sampling rate was carried out for the same ER-fMRI experiment. Experiments with visual cortex stimulation were carried out at 7 Tesla to demonstrate whether the multi-phase b-SSFP technique and GE-EPI are able to differentiate temporal delays in hemodynamic response function (HRF) separated by 100 ms in stimulus onset. Consistent with ERP results, the upslope of the HRF of both techniques can differentiate 100 ms delay in stimulus onset, with the former showing a lower level of intersubject variability. The present study demonstrated that the multi-phase passband b-SSFP fMRI technique can be applied for resolving neuronal events on the order of 100 ms at ultrahigh magnetic fields.

Although BOLD fMRI is a high temporal resolution fMRI approach to assess alterations in brain networks, it cannot pinpoint to a single correlation of neuronal activity since BOLD signals are composite. In contrast, arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a lower temporal resolution fMRI technique for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) that can provide quantitative, direct brain network physiology measurements. This paper proposes a novel sparse regression algorithm for inference of the integrated hyper-connectivity networks from BOLD fMRI and ASL fMRI. Specifically, a least absolution shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, which is constrained by the functional connectivity derived from ASL fMRI, is employed to estimate hyper-connectivity for characterizing BOLD-fMRI-based functional interaction among multiple regions. An ASL-derived functional connectivity is constructed by using an Ultra-GroupLASSO-UOLS algorithm, where the combination of ultra-least squares (ULS) criterion with a group LASSO (GroupLASSO) algorithm is applied to detect the topology of ASL-based functional connectivity networks, and then an ultra-orthogonal least squares (UOLS) algorithm is used to estimate the connectivity strength. By combining the complementary characterization conveyed by rs-fMRI and ASL fMRI, our multimodal hyper-networks demonstrated much better discriminative characteristics than either the conventional pairwise connectivity networks or the unimodal hyper-connectivity networks. Experimental results on publicly available ADNI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing single modality based sparse functional connectivity inference methods.

Recently, several groups have shown that temporal shifts are present in rs-fMRI maps in patients with cerebrovascular disease due to spatial differences in arterial arrival times, and that this can be exploited to map arrival times in the brain. This suggests that rs-fMRI connectivity mapping may be similarly sensitive to such temporal shifts, and that standard rs-fMRI analysis methods may fail to identify functional connectivity networks. To investigate this, we studied the default mode network (DMN) in Moyamoya disease patients and compared it with normal healthy volunteers. Our results show that using standard independent component analysis (ICA) and seed-based approaches, arterial arrival delays lead to inaccurate incomplete characterization of functional connectivity within the DMN in Moyamoya disease patients. Furthermore, we propose two techniques to correct these errors, for seed-based and ICA methods, respectively. Using these methods, we demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate the deleterious effects of arterial arrival time on the assessment of functional connectivity of the DMN. As these corrections have not been applied to the vast majority of >200 prior rs-fMRI studies in patients with cerebrovascular disease, we suggest that they be interpreted with great caution. Correction methods should be applied in any rs-fMRI connectivity study of subjects expected to have abnormally delayed arterial arrival times.

Resting-State Functional Connectivity of the Middle Frontal Gyrus Can Predict Language Lateralization in Patients with Brain Tumors	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; WORKING-MEMORY; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; FMRI ACTIVATION; DOMINANCE; MRI; NETWORKS; AREAS; CORTEX	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A recent study using task-based fMRI demonstrated that the middle frontal gyrus is comparable with Broca's area in its ability to determine language laterality using a measure of verbal fluency. This study investigated whether the middle frontal gyrus can be used as an indicator for language-hemispheric dominance in patients with brain tumors using task-free resting-state fMRI. We hypothesized that no significant difference in language lateralization would occur between the middle frontal gyrus and Broca area and that the middle frontal gyrus can serve as a simple and reliable means of measuring language laterality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using resting-state fMRI, we compared the middle frontal gyrus with the Broca area in 51 patients with glial neoplasms for voxel activation, the language laterality index, and the effect of tumor grade on the laterality index. The laterality index derived by resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI was compared in a subset of 40 patients. RESULTS: Voxel activations in the left middle frontal gyrus and left Broca area were positively correlated (r = 0.47, P < .001). Positive correlations were seen between the laterality index of the Broca area and middle frontal gyrus regions (r = 0.56, P < .0005). Twenty-seven of 40 patients (67.5%) showed concordance of the laterality index based on the Broca area using resting-state fMRI and the laterality index based on a language task. Thirty of 40 patients (75%) showed concordance of the laterality index based on the middle frontal gyrus using resting-state fMRI and the laterality index based on a language task. CONCLUSIONS: The middle frontal gyrus is comparable with the Broca area in its ability to determine hemispheric dominance for language using resting-state fMRI. Our results suggest the addition of resting-state fMRI of the middle frontal gyrus to the list of noninvasive modalities that could be used in patients with gliomas to evaluate hemispheric dominance of language before tumor resection. In patients who cannot participate in traditional task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI offers a task-free alternate to presurgically map the eloquent cortex.

The Benefit of Slice Timing Correction in Common fMRI Preprocessing Pipelines	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						slice timing correction; fMRI - functional magnetic resonance imaging; motion correction; preprocessing algorithms; interleaved 2D multislice sequence	MOTION CORRECTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CONFOUND REGRESSION; REGISTRATION; ARTIFACT; SEGMENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; ACTIVATIONS; RELIABILITY	Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from each other. To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it (1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, (2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and (3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined. Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level. We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing. However, its effectiveness interacts with other preprocessing steps and with other scan parameters and conditions which may obscure its significant importance in the fMRI processing pipeline.

A step-by-step tutorial on using the cognitive architecture ACT-R in combination with fMRI data	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ACT-R; fMRI; Cognitive architecture; Model-based analysis; Tutorial	MODEL-BASED FMRI; CONTROL NETWORK; GOOD FIT	The cognitive architecture ACT-R is at the same time a psychological theory and a modeling framework for constructing cognitive models that adhere to the principles of the theory. ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI data in two different ways: (1) fMRI data can be used to evaluate and constrain models in ACT-R by means of predefined Region-of-Interest (ROI) analysis, and (2) predictions from ACT-R models can be used to locate neural correlates of model processes and representations by means of model based fMRI analysis. In this paper we provide a step-by-step tutorial on both approaches. Note that this tutorial neither teaches the ACT-R theory in any detail, nor fMRI analysis, but explains how ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI data. To this end, we provide all data and computer code necessary to run the ACT-R model, carry out the analyses, and recreate the figures in the paper. As an example dataset we use a relatively simple algebra task. In the first section, we develop an ACT-R model of this task and fit it to behavioral data. In the second section, we apply a predefined ROI-analysis to evaluate the model using fMRI data. In the third section, we use model-based fMRI analysis to locate the following processes in the brain: retrieval of mathematical facts from memory, working memory updates, motor responses, and visually encoding the problems. After working through this tutorial, the reader will have learned what can be achieved with the two different analysis methods and how they are conducted; the example code can then be adapted to a new dataset.

Exploring the advantages of multiband fMRI with simultaneous EEG to investigate coupling between gamma frequency neural activity and the BOLD response in humans	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; gamma-BOLD coupling; gradient artefacts; heating; multiband fMRI; multislice fMRI; motor gamma oscillations; safety	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; ARTIFACT CORRECTION; GRADIENT ARTIFACT; RESTING-STATE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; WHOLE-BRAIN	We established an optimal combination of EEG recording during sparse multiband (MB) fMRI that preserves high-resolution, whole-brain fMRI coverage while enabling broad-band EEG recordings which are uncorrupted by MRI gradient artefacts (GAs). We first determined the safety of simultaneous EEG recording during MB fMRI. Application of MB factor=4 produced <1 degrees C peak heating of electrode/hardware during 20min of GE-EPI data acquisition. However, higher SAR sequences require specific safety testing, with greater heating observed using PCASL with MB factor=4. Heating was greatest in the electrocardiogram channel, likely due to it possessing longest lead length. We investigated the effect of MB factor on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio for a range of GE-EPI sequences (varying MB factor and temporal interval between slice acquisitions). We found that, for our experimental purpose, the optimal acquisition was achieved with MB factor=3, 3mm isotropic voxels, and 33 slices providing whole head coverage. This sequence afforded a 2.25s duration quiet period (without GAs) in every 3s TR. Using this sequence, we demonstrated the ability to record gamma frequency (55-80Hz) EEG oscillations, in response to right index finger abduction, that are usually obscured by GAs during continuous fMRI data acquisition. In this novel application of EEG-MB fMRI to a motor task, we observed a positive correlation between gamma and BOLD responses in bilateral motor regions. These findings support and extend previous work regarding coupling between neural and hemodynamic measures of brain activity in humans and showcase the utility of EEG-MB fMRI for future investigations.

Recovering task fMRI signals from highly under-sampled data with low-rank and temporal subspace constraints	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SPATIAL ICA; MRI; ACQUISITION; LATENCY; RECONSTRUCTION; SEPARATION; RESOLUTION	Recent developments in highly accelerated fMRI data acquisition have employed low-rank and/or sparsity constraints for image reconstruction, as an alternative to conventional, time-independent parallel imaging. When under-sampling factors are high or the signals of interest are low-variance, however, functional data recovery can be poor or incomplete. We introduce a method for improving reconstruction fidelity using external constraints, like an experimental design matrix, to partially orient the estimated fMRI temporal subspace. Combining these external constraints with low-rank constraints introduces a new image reconstruction model that is analogous to using a mixture of subspace-decomposition (PCA/ICA) and regression (GLM) models in fMRI analysis. We show that this approach improves fMRI reconstruction quality in simulations and experimental data, focusing on the model problem of detecting subtle 1-s latency shifts between brain regions in a block-design task-fMRI experiment. Successful latency discrimination is shown at acceleration factors up to R = 16 in a radial-Cartesian acquisition. We show that this approach works with approximate, or not perfectly informative constraints, where the derived benefit is commensurate with the information content contained in the constraints. The proposed method extends low-rank approximation methods for under-sampled fMRI data acquisition by leveraging knowledge of expected task-based variance in the data, enabling improvements in the speed and efficiency of fMRI data acquisition without the loss of subtle features.

Feasibility of topological data analysis for event-related fMRI	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Topological data analysis; Persistent homology; fMRI; Simulation; Event-related design; Representation	NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; INFERENCE; SPACE	Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology, that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether persistent homology-a popular TDA tool that identifies topological features in data and quantifies their robustness-can identify known signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations. Author SummaryHow do we represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of high-dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.

Annabel			Maximizing dissimilarity in resting state detects heterogeneous subtypes in healthy population associated with high substance use and problems in antisocial personality	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						alcohol; antisocial personality problems; common component; default mode network; drugs; functional MRI; marijuana; tobacco; gender effects	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; CINGULATE CORTEX; CANNABIS USERS; USE DISORDERS; ALCOHOL-USE; DRUG-USE; FMRI; BEHAVIOR	Patterns in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are widely used to characterize the trait effects of brain function. In this aspect, multiple rs-fMRI scans from single subjects can provide interesting clues about the rs-fMRI patterns, though scan-to-scan variability pose challenges. Therefore, rs-fMRI's are either concatenated or the functional connectivity is averaged. This leads to loss of information. Here, we use an alternative way to extract the rs-fMRI features that are common across all the scans by applying common-and-orthogonal-basis-extraction (COBE) technique. To address this, we employed rs-fMRI of 788 subjects from the human connectome project and estimated the common-COBE-component of each subject from the four rs-fMRI runs. Since the common-COBE-component is specific to a subject, the pattern was used to classify the subjects based on the similarity/dissimilarity of the features. The subset of subjects (n = 107) with maximal-COBE-dissimilarity (MCD) was extracted and the remaining subjects (n = 681) formed the COBE-similarity (CS) group. The distribution of weights of the common-COBE-component for the two groups across rs-fMRI networks and subcortical regions was evaluated. We found the weights in the default mode network to be lower in the MCD compared to the CS. We compared the scores of 69 behavioral measures and found six behaviors related to the use of marijuana, illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco; and including a measure of antisocial personality to differentiate the two groups. Gender differences were also significant. Altogether the findings suggested that subtypes exist even in healthy control population, and comparison studies (case vs. control) need to be mindful of it.

Clinical utility of resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging for mood and cognitive disorders	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Review						Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI); Functional connectivity (FC); Major depressive disorder (MDD); Bipolar disorder (BD); Dementia; Alzheimer's disease (AD)	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE PROGRESSION; LEWY BODIES; HUMAN BRAIN; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY; BIPOLAR DEPRESSION; HIPPOCAMPAL CONNECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has long been used to assess task-related brain activity in neuropsychiatric disorders, it has not yet become a widely available clinical tool. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been the subject of recent attention in the fields of basic and clinical neuroimaging research. This method enables investigation of the functional organization of the brain and alterations of resting-state networks (RSNs) in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Rs-fMRI does not require participants to perform a demanding task, in contrast to task fMRI, which often requires participants to follow complex instructions. Rs-fMRI has a number of advantages over task fMRI for application with neuropsychiatric patients, for example, although applications of task fMR to participants for healthy are easy. However, it is difficult to apply these applications to patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders, because they may have difficulty in performing demanding cognitive task. Here, we review the basic methodology and analysis techniques relevant to clinical studies, and the clinical applications of the technique for examining neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on mood disorders (major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder) and dementia (Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment).

Recently, BSS models based on restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), one of the building blocks of deep learning models, have been shown to improve brain network identification compared to conventional single matrix factorization models such as independent component analysis (ICA). These models, however, trained RBM on fMRI volumes, and are hence challenged by model complexity and limited training set. In this article, we propose to apply RBM to fMRI time courses instead of volumes for BSS. The proposed method not only interprets fMRI time courses explicitly to take advantages of deep learning models in latent feature learning but also substantially reduces model complexity and increases the scale of training set to improve training efficiency. Our experimental results based on Human Connectome Project (HCP) datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over ICA and the one that applied RBM to fMRI volumes in identifying task-related components, resulted in more accurate and specific representations of task-related activations. Moreover, our method separated out components representing intermixed effects between task events, which could reflect inherent interactions among functionally connected brain regions. Our study demonstrates the value of RBM in mining complex structures embedded in large-scale fMRI data and its potential as a building block for deeper models in fMRI data analysis.

Optimising EEG-fMRI for Localisation of Focal Epilepsy in Children	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; RESPONSES; SURGERY; STATE; CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS; ARTIFACT; TIME	Background Early surgical intervention in children with drug resistant epilepsy has benefits but requires using tolerable and minimally invasive tests. EEG-fMRI studies have demonstrated good sensitivity for the localization of epileptic focus but a poor yield although the reasons for this have not been systematically addressed. While adults EEG-fMRI studies are performed in the "resting state"; children are commonly sedated however, this has associated risks and potential confounds. In this study, we assessed the impact of the following factors on the tolerability and results of EEG-fMRI in children: viewing a movie inside the scanner; movement; occurrence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED); scan duration and design efficiency. This work's motivation is to optimize EEG-fMRI parameters to make this test widely available to paediatric population Methods Forty-six children with focal epilepsy and 20 controls (6-18) underwent EEG-fMRI. For two 10 minutes sessions subjects were told to lie still with eyes closed, as it is classically performed in adult studies ("rest sessions"), for another two sessions, subjects watched a child friendly stimulation i.e. movie ("movie sessions"). IED were mapped with EEG-fMRI for each session and across sessions. The resulting maps were classified as concordant/discordant with the presumed epileptogenic focus for each subject. Findings Movement increased with scan duration, but the movie reduced movement by similar to 40% when played within the first 20 minutes. There was no effect of movie on the occurrence of IED, nor in the concordance of the test. Ability of EEG-fMRI to map the epileptogenic region was similar for the 20 and 40 minute scan durations. Design efficiency was predictive of concordance. Conclusions A child friendly natural stimulus improves the tolerability of EEG-fMRI and reduces in-scanner movement without having an effect on IED occurrence and quality of EEG-fMRI maps. This allowed us to scan children as young as 6 and obtain localising information without sedation. Our data suggest that similar to 20 minutes is the optimal length of scanning for EEG-fMRI studies in children with frequent IED. The efficiency of the fMRI design derived from spontaneous IED generation is an important factor for producing concordant results.

Resting-State Functional MRI: Everything That Nonexperts Have Always Wanted to Know	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Review							SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SMALL-WORLD; LOW-FREQUENCY; FMRI DATA; CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; ANATOMICAL NETWORKS; SUBJECT VARIABILITY	Resting-state fMRI was first described by Biswal et al in 1995 and has since then been widely used in both healthy subjects and patients with various neurologic, neurosurgical, and psychiatric disorders. As opposed to paradigm- or task-based functional MR imaging, resting-state fMRI does not require subjects to perform any specific task. The low-frequency oscillations of the resting-state fMRI signal have been shown to relate to the spontaneous neural activity. There are many ways to analyze resting-state fMRI data. In this review article, we will briefly describe a few of these and highlight the advantages and limitations of each. This description is to facilitate the adoption and use of resting-state fMRI in the clinical setting, helping neuroradiologists become familiar with these techniques and applying them for the care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric diseases.

However, the possibility of neurovascular dissociations across physiological alterations is indicated in the literature. To examine the NVC stability across sleep-wake states, we used electroencephalography (EEG) as the index of neural activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as the measure of cerebrovascular response. Eight healthy adults were recruited for simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings in nocturnal sleep. We compared the cross-modality (EEG vs. fMRI) consistency of functional indices (spectral amplitude and functional connectivity) among five states of wakefulness and sleep (state effect). We also segregated the brain into three main partitions (anterior, middle and posterior) for spatial assessments (regional effect). Significant state effects were found on delta, alpha and fMRI indices and regional effects on the alpha and fMRI indices. However, the cross-state EEG changes in spectral amplitude and functional connectivity did not consistently match the changes in the fMRI indices across sleep-wake states. In spectral amplitude, the delta band peaked at the N3 stage for all brain regions, while the fMRI fluctuation amplitude peaked at the N2 stage in the central and posterior regions. In regional connectivity, the inter-hemispheric connectivity of the delta band peaked at the N3 stage for all regions, but the bilateral fMRI connectivity showed the state changes in the anterior and central regions. The cross-modality inconsistencies across sleep-wake states provided preliminary evidence that the neurovascular relationship may not change in a linear consistency during NREM sleep. Thus, caution shall be exercised when applying the NVC presumption to investigating sleep/wake transitions, even among healthy young adults.

Each of the enantiomers in this racemic mixture, (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine, have been reported to exert antidepressant effects individually. However, the neuropharmacological effects of these enantiomers and the mechanisms underlying their antidepressive actions have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effect of (R,S)-, (R)-, and (S)-ketamine on brain activity by functional MRI (fMRI) in conscious rats and compared these with that of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 (n = 5 similar to 7). We also assessed their pharmacokinetic profiles (n = 4) and their behavioral effects (n = 7 similar to 9). This pharmacological MRI study revealed a significant positive response to (S)-ketamine specifically in the cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum. In contrast, negative fMRI responses were observed in various brain regions after (R)-ketamine administration. (R,S)-ketamine, evoked significant positive fMRI responses specifically in the cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum, and this fMRI response pattern was comparable with that of (S)-ketamine. MK-801-induced similar fMRI response pattern to (S)-ketamine. The fMRI responses to (S)-ketamine and MK-801 showed differential temporal profiles, which corresponded with brain concentration profiles. (S)-ketamine and MK-801 significantly increased locomotor activity, while (R)-ketamine produced no noticeable change. (R,S)-ketamine tended to increase locomotor activity. Our novel fMRI findings show that (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine induce completely different fMRI response patterns on rat, and that the response produced by the latter is similar to that elicited by an NMDAR antagonist. Our findings provide insight into the antidepressant mechanism of (R,S)-ketamine.

Test-retest repeatability of patterns of brain activation provoked by bladder filling	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						fMRI; neuroimaging; reproducibility of results; test-retest reliability; urge; urinary incontinence; women	WHITE-MATTER; MICTURITION; CONTRACTIONS; NIRS	ObjectiveTo assess short-term repeatability of an fMRI protocol widely used to assess brain control of the bladder. fMRI offers the potential to discern incontinence phenotypes as well as the mechanisms mediating therapeutic response. If so, this could enable more targeted efforts to enhance therapy. Such data, however, require excellent test-retest repeatability. MethodsFifty-nine older women (age 60 years) with urgency incontinence underwent two fMRI scans within 5-10min with a concurrent bladder infusion/withdrawal protocol. Activity in three brain regions relevant to bladder control was compared using paired t tests and intra-class correlation. ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences in brain activity between the two consecutive scans in the regions of interest. Intra-class correlation was 0.19 in the right insula, 0.32 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, and 0.44 in the medial pre-frontal cortex. Such correlations are considered fair or poor, but are comparable to those from studies of other repeated fMRI tasks. ConclusionsThis is the first evaluation of the repeatability of a bladder fMRI protocol. The technique used provides a framework for comparing different fMRI protocols applied to brain-bladder research. Despite universal patient response to the stimulus, brain response had limited repeatability within individuals. Improvement of the investigational protocol should magnify brain response and reduce variability. These results suggest that although analysis of fMRI data among groups of subjects yields valuable insight into bladder control, fMRI is not yet appropriate for evaluation of the brain's role in continence on an individual level.

Neurovascular Uncoupling in Resting State fMRI Demonstrated in Patients With Primary Brain Gliomas	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; MOTOR CORTEX; BOLD FMRI; ACTIVATION; TUMORS; HANDEDNESS; MRI	Background: To demonstrate that the problem of brain tumor-related neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) is a significant issue with respect to resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (rsfMRI) similar to task-based BOLD fMRI, in which signal detectability can be compromised by breakdown of normal neurovascular coupling. Methods: We evaluated seven de novo brain tumor patients who underwent resting state fMRI as part of comprehensive clinical fMRI exams at 3 Tesla. For each of the seven patients who demonstrated evidence of NVU on task-based motor fMRI, we performed both an independent component analysis (ICA) and an atlas-based parcellation-based seed correlation analysis (SCA) of the resting state fMRI data. For each patient, ipsilesional (IL) and contralesional (CL) regions of interest (ROIs) comprising primary motor and somatosensory cortices were used to evaluate BOLD signal changes on Z score maps derived from both ICA and SCA analysis for evidence of NVU. A subsequent two-tailed t-test was performed to determine whether statistically significant differences between the two sides were present that were consistent with NVU. Results: In seven patients, overall decreased BOLD signal (based on suprathreshold voxels in ICA and SCA-derived Z-score maps) was noted in IL compared with CL ROIs (P<0.01), consistent with NVU. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NVU can result in false negative BOLD signal changes on rsfMRI comparable to previously published findings on standard motor task-based fMRI.

These have been related to frontal hemispheric asymmetries in clinical and resting-state EEG studies: Approach was linked to higher activity of the left relative to the right hemisphere, while avoidance was related to the opposite pattern. Increased approach behaviour, specifically towards unhealthy foods, is also observed in obesity and has been linked to asymmetry in the framework of the right-brain hypothesis of obesity. Here, we aimed to replicate previous EEG findings of hemispheric asymmetries for self-reported approach/avoidance behaviour and to relate them to eating behaviour. Further, we assessed whether resting fMRI hemispheric asymmetries can be detected and whether they are related to approach/avoidance, eating behaviour and BMI. We analysed three samples: Sample 1 (n = 117) containing EEG and fMRI data from lean participants, and Samples 2 (n = 89) and 3 (n = 152) containing fMRI data from lean, overweight and obese participants. In Sample 1, approach behaviour in women was related to EEG, but not to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. In Sample 2, approach/avoidance behaviours were related to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. Finally, hemispheric asymmetries were not related to either BMI or eating behaviour in any of the samples. Our study partly replicates previous EEG findings regarding hemispheric asymmetries and indicates that this relationship could also be captured using fMRI. Our findings suggest that eating behaviour and obesity are likely to be mediated by mechanisms not directly relating to frontal asymmetries in neuronal activation quantified with EEG and fMRI.

Relationship between fMRI response during a nonverbal memory task and marijuana use in college students	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						fMRI; Marijuana; Memory; Adolescence	CANNABIS USE DISORDER; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALCOHOL-USE; ADULT RATS; ADOLESCENTS; PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; DRINKERS; DELTA(9)-THC	Marijuana (MJ) is widely used among college students, with peak use between ages 18-22. Research suggests memory dysfunction in adolescent and young adult MJ users, but the neural correlates are unclear. We examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response during a memory task among college students with varying degrees of MJ involvement. Participants were 64 college students, ages 18-20, who performed a visual encoding and recognition task during fMRI. MJ use was ascertained for 3 months prior to scanning; 27 individuals reported past 3-month MJ use, and 33 individuals did not. fMRI response was modeled during encoding based on whether targets were subsequently recognized (correct encoding), and during recognition based on target identification (hits). fMRI response in left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and hippocampal regions of interest was examined between MJ users and controls. There were no group differences between MJ users and controls on fMRI response during encoding, although single sample t-tests revealed that MJ users failed to activate the hippocampus. During recognition, MJ users showed less fMRI response than controls in right hippocampus (Cohen's d = 0.55), left hippocampus (Cohen's d = 0.67) and left IFG (Cohen's d = 0.61). Heavier MJ involvement was associated with lower fMRI response in left hippocampus and left IFG. This study provides evidence of MJ-related prefrontal and hippocampal dysfunction during recognition memory in college students. These findings may contribute to our previously identified decrements in academic performance in college MJ users and could have substantial implications for academic and occupational functioning.

By collecting transient brain regional signals, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) function MRI (BOLD-fMRI) can provide brain function change information with high accuracy. By using resting state BOLD-fMRI technique, we aim to investigate the changes of brain function in partial epilepsy patients. Methods: BOLD-fMRI scanning was performed in 70 partial epilepsy and 70 healthy people. BOLD-fMRI data was analyzed by using the Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) method and functional connectivity of Default Mode Network (DMN) methods. The abnormal brain functional connectivity in partial epilepsy patients was detected by Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) analysis. Results: Compared to healthy group, epilepsy patients showed significant decreased ReHo in left inferior parietal lobule/pre- and post-central gyrus, right thalamus/paracentral lobule/Cerebellum anterior and posterior Lobe, bilateral insula. The DMN functional connectivity regions decreased significantly in right uncus, left Inferior parietal lobule, left supramarginal gyrus, left uncus, left parahippocampa gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus, in epilepsy patients, compared to healthy controls. Significance: This study clarified that both ReHo and functional connectivity of DMN decreased in partial epilepsy patients compared to healthy controls. While left inferior parietal lobule was detected in both ReHo and DMN, many other identified regions were different by using these two BOLD-fMRI techniques. We propose that both ReHo and DMN patterns in BOLD-fMRI may suggest networks responsible for partial epilepsy genesis or progression.

In pre-clinical research with small rodents, obtaining simultaneous EEG-fMRI in longitudinal studies faces a number of challenges, including issues related to magnetic susceptibility artifacts. New method: Here, we demonstrate a method for permanent MRI RF-coil and EEG electrode implantation in rats that is suitable for long-term chronic follow-up studies in both stimulus and resting-state fMRI paradigms. Results: Our findings showed that the screw-free implantation method is well suited for long-term followup studies in both freely moving video-EEG settings and fMRI without causing MRI susceptibility artifacts. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that a multimodal approach can be used to track the progression of structural and functional changes. Comparison with existing methods: The quality of both MRI and EEG data were comparable to those obtained with traditional methods with the benefit of combining them into artifact-free simultaneous recordings. The signal-to-noise ratios of the MRI images obtained with the implanted RF-coil were similar to those using a quadrature coil and were therefore suitable for resting-state fMRI experiments. Similarly, EEG data collected with the RF-coil/electrode set-up were comparable to EEG recorded with traditional epidural screw electrodes. Conclusion: This new multimodal EEG-fMRI approach provides a novel tool for concomitant analysis and follow-up of anatomic and functional MRI, as well as electrographic changes in a preclinical research.

Here, we examine whether sub-millimeter fMRI can be used as a routine method for obtaining accurate measurements of fine-scale local neural activity. We conducted fMRI in human visual cortex during a simple event-related visual experiment (7T, gradient-echo EPI, 0.8-mm isotropic voxels, 2.2-s sampling rate, 84 slices), and developed analysis and visualization tools to assess the quality of the data. Our results fall along three lines of inquiry. First, we find that the acquired fMRI images, combined with appropriate surface-based processing, provide reliable and accurate measurements of fine-scale blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity patterns. Second, we show that the highly folded structure of cortex causes substantial biases on spatial resolution and data visualization. Third, we examine the well-recognized issue of venous contributions to fMRI signals. In a systematic assessment of large sections of cortex measured at a fine scale, we show that time-averaged T-2*-weighted EPI intensity is a simple, robust marker of venous effects. These venous effects are unevenly distributed across cortex, are more pronounced in gyri and outer cortical depths, and are, to a certain degree, in consistent locations across subjects relative to cortical folding. Furthermore, we show that these venous effects are strongly correlated with BOLD responses evoked by the experiment. We conclude that sub-millimeter fMRI can provide robust information about fine-scale BOLD activity patterns, but special care must be exercised in visualizing and interpreting these patterns, especially with regards to the confounding influence of the brain's vasculature. To help translate these methodological findings to neuroscience research, we provide practical suggestions for both high-resolution and standard-resolution fMRI studies.

Optimizing Within-Subject Experimental Designs for jICA of Multi-Channel ERP and fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; ERP; EEG; independent component analysis (ICA); multimodal neuroimaging; modeling; simulation; data fusion	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; DATA FUSION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SEPARATION; REGISTRATION; INTEGRATION; NETWORKS	Joint independent component analysis (jICA) can be applied within subject for fusion of multi-channel event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to measure brain function at high spatiotemporal resolution (Mangalathu-Arumana et al., 2012). However, the impact of experimental design choices on jICA performance has not been systematically studied. Here, the sensitivity of jICA for recovering neural sources in individual data was evaluated as a function of imaging SNR, number of independent representations of the ERP/fMRI data, relationship between instantiations of the joint ERP/fMRI activity (linear, non-linear, uncoupled), and type of sources (varying parametrically and non-parametrically across representations of the data), using computer simulations. Neural sources were simulated with spatiotemporal and noise attributes derived from experimental data. The best performance, maximizing both cross-modal data fusion and the separation of brain sources, occurred with a moderate number of representations of the ERP/fMRI data (10-30), as in a mixed block/event related experimental design. Importantly, the type of relationship between instantiations of the ERP/fMRI activity, whether linear, non-linear or uncoupled, did not in itself impact jICA performance, and was accurately recovered in the common profiles (i.e., mixing coefficients). Thus, jICA provides an unbiased way to characterize the relationship between ERP and fMRI activity across brain regions, in individual data, rendering it potentially useful for characterizing pathological conditions in which neurovascular coupling is adversely affected.

Examining resting-state functional connectivity in first-episode schizophrenia with 7T fMRI and MEG	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetoencephalography; First-episode; Schizophrenia; Independent component analysis	ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION; UNMEDICATED PATIENTS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN NETWORKS; DRUG-NAIVE; EPISODE; CORTEX; RANGE	Schizophrenia is often characterized by dysconnections in the brain, which can be estimated via functional connectivity analyses. Commonly measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to characterize the intrinsic or baseline function of the brain, fMRI functional connectivity has significantly contributed to the understanding of schizophrenia. However, these measures may not capture the full extent of functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia as fMRI is temporally limited by the hemodynamic response. In order to extend fMRI functional connectivity findings, the complementary modally of magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be utilized to capture electrophysiological functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia that are not obtainable with fMRI. Therefore, we implemented a multimodal functional connectivity analysis using resting-state 7 Tesla fMRI and MEG data in a sample of first-episode patients with schizophrenia (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 24). fMRI and MEG data were decomposed into components reflecting resting state networks using a group spatial independent component analysis. Functional connectivity between resting-state networks was computed and group differences were observed. In fMRI, patients demonstrated hyperconnectivity between subcortical and auditory networks, as well as hypoconnectivity between interhemispheric homotopic sensorimotor network components. In MEG, patients demonstrated hypoconnectivity between sensorimotor and task positive networks in the delta frequency band. Results not only support the dysconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia, but also suggest the importance of jointly examining multimodal neuroimaging data as critical disorder-related information may not be detectable in a single modally alone.

APPETITE			English	Article						fMRI; Food-cue reactivity; Hunger; Satiety; Obesity; Neuroimaging	WEIGHT-GAIN; EXPOSURE; ROBUST; STIMULI; SEGMENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; ACTIVATION; SATIATION; RESPONSES	We considered 1) influence of self-reported hunger in behavioral and fMRI food-cue reactivity (fMRIFCR) 2) optimal methods to model this. Adults (N = 32; 19-60 years; F = 21; BMI 30-39.9 kg/m(2)) participated in an fMRI-FCR task that required rating 240 images of food and matched objects for 'appeal'. Hunger, satiety, thirst, fullness and emptiness were measured pre- and post-scan (visual analogue scales). Hunger, satiety, fullness and emptiness were combined to form a latent factor (appetite). Post-vs. pre-scores were compared using paired t-tests. In mixed-effects models, appeal/fMRI-FCR responses were regressed on image (i.e. food/ objects), with random intercepts and slopes of image for functional runs nested within subjects. Each of hunger, satiety, thirst, fullness, emptiness and appetite were added as covariates in 4 forms (separate models): 1) change; 2) post- and pre-mean; 3) pre-; 4) change and pre-. Satiety decreased (Delta = 13.39, p = 0.001) and thirst increased (Delta = 11.78, p = 0.006) during the scan. Changes in other constructs were not significant (p's > 0.05). Including covariates did not influence food vs. object contrast of appeal ratings/fMRI-FCR. Significant image X covariate interactions were observed in some fMRI models. However, including these constructs did not improve the overall model fit. While some subjective, self-reported hunger, satiety and related constructs may be moderating fMRIFCR, these constructs do not appear to be salient influences on appeal/fMRI-FCR in people with obesity undergoing fMRI.

Practice guideline summary: Use of fMRI in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; VERBAL MEMORY DECLINE; LANGUAGE DOMINANCE; WADA TEST; FUNCTIONAL MRI; LATERALIZATION; ACTIVATION; RESECTION; TASK; TOPIRAMATE	Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of functional MRI (fMRI) in determining lateralization and predicting postsurgical language and memory outcomes. Methods: An 11-member panel evaluated and rated available evidence according to the 2004 American Academy of Neurology process. At least 2 panelists reviewed the full text of 172 articles and selected 37 for data extraction. Case reports, reports with,15 cases, metaanalyses, and editorials were excluded. Results and recommendations: The use of fMRI may be considered an option for lateralizing language functions in place of intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE; Level C), temporal epilepsy in general (Level C), or extratemporal epilepsy (Level C). For patients with temporal neocortical epilepsy or temporal tumors, the evidence is insufficient (Level U). fMRI may be considered to predict postsurgical language deficits after anterior temporal lobe resection (Level C). The use of fMRI may be considered for lateralizing memory functions in place of IAP in patients with MTLE (Level C) but is of unclear utility in other epilepsy types (Level U). fMRI of verbal memory or language encoding should be considered for predicting verbal memory outcome (Level B). fMRI using nonverbal memory encoding may be considered for predicting visuospatial memory outcomes (Level C). Presurgical fMRI could be an adequate alternative to IAP memory testing for predicting verbal memory outcome (Level C). Clinicians should carefully advise patients of the risks and benefits of fMRI vs IAP during discussions concerning choice of specific modality in each case.

The BOLD response in primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area during kinesthetic motor imagery based graded fMRI neurofeedback	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							REAL-TIME FMRI; RESONANCE-IMAGING NEUROFEEDBACK; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; BRAIN ACTIVATION; SELF-REGULATION; STROKE; EXECUTION; NETWORK; CONNECTIVITY; MODULATION	There is increasing interest in exploring the use of functional MRI neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) as a therapeutic technique for a range of neurological conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD). One main therapeutic potential of fMRI-NF is to enhance volitional control of damaged or dysfunctional neural nodes and networks via a closed-loop feedback model using mental imagery as the catalyst of self-regulation. The choice of target node/network and direction of regulation (increase or decrease activity) are central design considerations in fMRI-NF studies. Whilst it remains unclear whether the primary motor cortex (M1) can be activated during motor imagery, the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been robustly activated during motor imagery. Such differences in the regulation potential between primary and supplementary motor cortex are important because these areas can be differentially affected by a stroke or PD, and the choice of fMRI-NF target and grade of self-regulation of activity likely have substantial influence on the clinical effects and cost effectiveness of NF-based interventions. In this study we therefore investigated firstly whether healthy subjects would be able to achieve self-regulation of the hand-representation areas of M1 and the SMA using fMRI-NF training. There was a significant decrease in M1 neural activity during fMRI-NF, whereas SMA neural activity was increased, albeit not with the predicated graded effect. This study has important implications for fMRI-NF protocols that employ motor imagery to modulate activity in specific target regions of the brain and to determine how they may be tailored for neurorehabilitation.

Multiband resting state fMRI (MB-rsfMRI) is a fairly new technique that potentially shortens MR image acquisition time by providing increased number of time points. The study aims to compare signal characteristics as well as the functional connectivity using conventional resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) with that of MB-rsfMRI technique. Materials and methods: 9 healthy volunteers have prospectively undergone conventional resting-state fMRI and Multiband rsfMRI scanning technique in a 3T GE scanner (Discovery MR750w (TM)). We compared the temporal SNR (tSNR) of conventional rs-fMRI with that of MB-rsfMRI. We looked at the language network connectivity and small world network characteristics from graph theoretical measures to compare the two techniques. Results: We computed the tSNR of conventional resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) and MB-rsfMRI technique. A strong positive correlation was seen between graph theoretical measures from MB-rsfMRI and conventional rsfMRI (Pearson Correlation, r = 0.99). Both techniques showed similar small world network characteristics in healthy controls. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates negligible differences between the conventional-rsfMRI and MB-rsfMRI acquisitions on the computed graph theoretic measures. Accordingly current analysis proves that MB-rsfMRI may be used as a time reducing acquisition technique that enables mapping of functional connectivity with similar outcome as conventional rs-fMRI in healthy subjects.

We performed group analysis to demonstrate the effects of brain tumor on resting-state networks (RSNs). METHODS: Thirty patients with supratentorial gliomas were included in the study. Preoperative rs-fMRI and structural magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all cases. The rs-fMRI was preprocessed (realignment, slice time correction, coregistration to structural images, normalization, and smoothing). The structural images were segmented and normalized. Band filtering and denoising were applied to the functional images. Connectivity analysis was performed using seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) at single subject level and group level. Correlation algorism has been used with r > 0.5. RESULTS: RSNs could be detected in all patients. They showed similarity to the results of the task-based fMRI, when task-based fMRI was feasible. Detection of the networks was also possible in patients with neurologic deficits, in whom task-based fMRI was not possible. We could use SCA in patients under anesthesia. High-level networks (default mode, salience, and dorsal attention networks) were detectable but showed a wide spectrum of spatial alterations and component disconnections. CONCLUSIONS: rs-fMRI is a feasible method for extended brain mapping. Diverse RSNs could be detected in patients with brain tumors and could be applied in preoperative planning. SCA was a robust and direct approach for data analysis and could answer specific clinically relevant questions. However, further studies are needed to validate the technique and its clinical impact.

However, most connectivity analysis approaches adopted in practice are linear and non-directional. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of a data-driven, directed connectivity analysis approach called Mutual Connectivity Analysis using Local Models (MCA-LM) that approximates connectivity by modeling nonlinear dependencies of signal interaction, over more conventionally used approaches, such as Pearson's and partial correlation, Patel's conditional dependence measures, etcetera. We demonstrate on realistic simulations of fMRI data that, at long sampling intervals, i.e. high repetition time (TR) of fMRI signals, MCA-LM performs better than or comparable to correlation-based methods and Patel's measures. However, at fast image acquisition rates corresponding to low TR, MCA-LM significantly outperforms these methods. This insight is particularly useful in the light of recent advances in fast fMRI acquisition techniques. Methods that can capture the complex dynamics of brain activity, such as MCA-LM, should be adopted to extract as much information as possible from the improved representation. Furthermore, MCA-LM works very well for simulations generated at weak neuronal interaction strengths, and simulations modeling inhibitory and excitatory connections as it disentangles the two opposing effects between pairs of regions/voxels. Additionally, we demonstrate that MCA-LM is capable of capturing meaningful directed connectivity on experimental fMRI data. Such results suggest that it introduces sufficient complexity into modeling fMRI time-series interactions that simple, linear approaches cannot, while being data-driven, computationally practical and easy to use. In conclusion, MCA-LM can provide valuable insights towards better understanding brain activity.

Individual differences in rate of acquiring stable neural representations of tasks in fMRI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION	Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely-used tool for studying the neural processing correlates of human behavior in both healthy and clinical populations. There is growing interest in mapping individual differences in fMRI task behavior and neural responses. By utilizing neuroadaptive task designs accounting for such individual differences, task durations can be personalized to potentially optimize neuroimaging study outcomes (e.g., classification of task-related brain states). To test this hypothesis, we first retrospectively tracked the volume-by-volume changes of beta weights generated from general linear models (GLM) for 67 adult subjects performing a stop-signal task (SST).We then modeled the convergence of the volume-by-volume changes of beta weights according to their exponential decay (ED) in units of half-life. Our results showed significant differences in beta weight convergence estimates of optimal stopping times (OSTs) between go following successful stop trials and failed stop trials for both cocaine dependent (CD) and control group (Con), and between go following successful stop trials and go following failed stop trials for Con group. Further, we implemented support vector machine (SVM) classification for 67 CD/Con labeled subjects and compared the classification accuracies of fMRI-based features derived from (1) the full fMRI task versus (2) the fMRI task truncated to multiples of the unit of half-life. Among the computed binary classification accuracies, two types of task durations based on 2 half-lives significantly outperformed the accuracies using fully acquired trials, supporting this length as the OST for the SST. In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential of a neuroadaptive task design that can be widely applied to personalizing other task-based fMRI experiments in either dynamic real-time fMRI applications or within fMRI preprocessing pipelines.

It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (>5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's alpha rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.

In this study, we investigated the effect of a newly proposed denoising approach, integrated multi-echo rs-FMRI analysis, on language mapping. Methods: Multiband multi-echo rs-FMRI data were acquired, along with language task FMRI that identified language areas in the left hemisphere of 12 subjects. The language laterality and specificity of the language mapping given by seed-based correlation analysis were compared among the rs-FMRI data sets pre-processed using 3 different approaches: multi-echo data with integrated multi-echo independent component analysis, denoising that uses the TE-dependency of each signal component to judge its origin, and multi-echo and single-echo data with conventional denoising. The laterality index was automatically computed without setting any threshold to minimize the arbitrariness and to ensure the generality of the result. Results: A repeated measures analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests showed that optimal combination of the 3-echo data succeeded in increasing the correlation within the targeted language system. With the physically principled multi-echo denoising approach, the integrated strategy further succeeded in revealing areas of synchronization more specific to the language system compared with conventional denoising approach, which eventually improved the identification of the laterality of the system. Conclusion: By successfully reducing non-specific correlations spreading over the brain, integrated multi-echo approach improved language mapping and identification of the laterality of the system using rs-FMRI.

Language Functional MRI and Direct Cortical Stimulation in Epilepsy Preoperative Planning	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AUDITORY COMPREHENSION; FMRI; LOCALIZATION; WADA; DOMINANCE; LATERALIZATION; VALIDATION; CHILDREN; AREAS; MOTOR	Objective: Presurgical language assessment can help minimize damage to eloquent cortex during resective epilepsy surgery. Two methods for presurgical language mapping are functional MRI (fMRI) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) of implanted subdural electrodes. We compared fMRI results to DCS to help optimize noninvasive language localization and assess its validity. Methods: We studied 19 patients referred for presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients completed four language tasks during preoperative fMRI. After subdural electrode implantation, we used DCS to localize language areas. For each stimulation site, we determined whether language positive electrode pairs intersected with significant fMRI activity clusters for language tasks. Results: Sensitivity and specificity depended on electrode region of interest radii and statistical thresholding. For patients with at least one language positive stimulation site, an auditory description decision task provided the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. For patients with no language positive stimulation sites, fMRI was a dependable method of excluding eloquent language processing. Interpretation: Language fMRI is an effective tool for determining language lateralization before electrode implantation and is especially useful for excluding unexpected critical language areas. It can help guide subdural electrode implantation and narrow the search for eloquent cortical areas by DCS.

Denoising is critical for HFO studies. Previous work indicated that head motion (HM) has remarkable influences on a variety of rs-fMRI metrics, but its influences on rs-fMRI HFOs are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the impacts of HM regression (HMR) on HFO results using a fast sampling rs-fMRI dataset. We demonstrated that apparent high-frequency (similar to 0.2-0.4 Hz) components existed in the HM trajectories in almost all subjects. In addition, we found that individual-level HMR could robustly reveal more between-condition (eye-open vs. eye-closed) amplitude differences in high-frequency bands. Although regression of mean framewise displacement (FD) at the group level had little impact on the results, mean FD could significantly account for inter-subject variance of HFOs even after individual-level HMR. Our findings suggest that HM artifacts should not be ignored in HFO studies, and HMR is necessary for detecting HFO between-condition differences.

Methods This manuscript provides an educational review of the current use of resting-state fMRI in the field of parkinsonian syndromes. Results Resting-state fMRI studies have improved the current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying motor and non-motor symptom development and progression in movement disorders. Even if its inclusion in clinical practice is still far away, resting-state fMRI has the potential to be a promising biomarker for early disease detection and prediction. It may also aid in differential diagnosis and monitoring brain responses to therapeutic agents and neurorehabilitation strategies in different movement disorders. Conclusions There is urgent need to identify and validate prodromal biomarkers in PD patients, to perform further studies assessing both overlapping and disease-specific fMRI abnormalities among parkinsonian syndromes, and to continue technical advances to fully realize the potential of fMRI as a tool to monitor the efficacy of chronic therapies.

Modeling rich information from spatially-organized collection of fMRI time series is challenging because of the intrinsic complexity. Hypothesis-driven methods, such as the general linear model (GLM), which regress exterior stimulus from voxel-wise functional brain activity, are limited due to overlooking the complexity of brain activities and the diversity of concurrent brain networks. Recently, sparse representation and dictionary learning methods have attracted increasing interests in task fMRI data analysis. The major advantage of this methodology is its promise in reconstructing concurrent brain networks systematically. However, this data-driven strategy is, to some extent, arbitrary and does not sufficiently utilize the prior information of task design and neuroscience knowledge. To bridge this gap, we here propose a novel supervised sparse representation and dictionary learning framework based on stochastic coordinate coding (SCC) algorithm for task fMRI data analysis, in which certain brain networks are learned with known information such as pre-defined temporal patterns and spatial network patterns, and at the same time other networks are learned automatically from data. Our proposed method has been applied to two independent task fMRI datasets, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations have shown that our method provides a new and effective framework for task fMRI data analysis.

J	Seghouane, AK; Shah, A; Ting, CM				Seghouane, Abd-Krim; Shah, Adnan; Ting, Chee-Ming			fMRI hemodynamic response function estimation in autoregressive noise by avoiding the drift	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Functional MRI; Hemodynamic response function; Drift; Autoregressive noise; Generalized least squares	JOINT DETECTION-ESTIMATION; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; TIME-SERIES; BOLD FMRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; LINEAR-MODEL; INFERENCE; MRI; AUTOCORRELATION; DECONVOLUTION	The measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series is typically corrupted by instrumental drift and physiological noise due to respiration and heartbeat giving rise to temporal correlation in the signals. Most methods proposed so far for nonparametric hemodynamic response function (HRF) estimation in fMRI data do not account for these confounding effects, and thus produce biased and inefficient estimates. The aim of this paper is to address this issue by modeling the noise in fMRI time series using an autoregressive model of order p (AR(p)). Making use of a semiparametric model to characterize the fMRI time series and the AR(p) to model the temporally correlated noise, a generalized least squares (GLS) estimator for voxelwise consistent nonparametric HRF estimation is derived. The proposed estimation method is a three-stage procedure that relies on first-order differencing to remove drift and a novel structured covariance estimator for the AR noise based on Cholesky decomposition to derive the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the HRF. We also establish the asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed method generates more accurate HRF estimates compared to existing methods. When applied to real fMRI data, it demonstrates the effectiveness in uncovering the brain response temporal dynamics for both event-related and block-design paradigms. Our approach removes the two types of noise in fMRI data simultaneously, thus providing efficient estimation of brain hemodynamic responses, while allowing for flexible characterization of the shape and timing of the voxelwise HRF.

Fast fMRI can detect oscillatory neural activity in humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						oscillations; hemodynamics; imaging; BOLD	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BOLD FMRI; BALLOON MODEL; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; IMPULSE-RESPONSE; SLOW WAVES	Oscillatory neural dynamics play an important role in the coordination of large-scale brain networks. High-level cognitive processes depend on dynamics evolving over hundreds of milliseconds, so measuring neural activity in this frequency range is important for cognitive neuroscience. However, current noninvasive neuroimaging methods are not able to precisely localize oscillatory neural activity above 0.2 Hz. Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography have limited spatial resolution, whereas fMRI has limited temporal resolution because it measures vascular responses rather than directly recording neural activity. We hypothesized that the recent development of fast fMRI techniques, combined with the extra sensitivity afforded by ultra-high-field systems, could enable precise localization of neural oscillations. We tested whether fMRI can detect neural oscillations using human visual cortex as a model system. We detected small oscillatory fMRI signals in response to stimuli oscillating at up to 0.75 Hz within single scan sessions, and these responses were an order of magnitude larger than predicted by canonical linear models. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI and simulations based on a biophysical model of the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity suggested that the blood oxygen level-dependent response becomes faster for rapidly varying stimuli, enabling the detection of higher frequencies than expected. Accounting for phase delays across voxels further improved detection, demonstrating that identifying vascular delays will be of increasing importance with higher-frequency activity. These results challenge the assumption that the hemodynamic response is slow, and demonstrate that fMRI has the potential to map neural oscillations directly throughout the brain.

At ultra-high resolution fMRI, current requirements regarding translational and rotational motion may no longer be acceptable. This prompts the need for a systematic investigation of the effects of motion correction procedures with in vivo fMRI data. Here we systematically evaluated the effect of retrospective motion correction with freely available fMRI analysis software packages (FSL, AFNI, and SPM) on activation maps using fMRI data acquired with prospective motion detection, to identify and quantify confounding effects of retrospective motion correction, and to evaluate its dependence on spatial resolution and motion correction algorithms. Brain activation maps were obtained for two different resolutions, an ultrahigh, that is, 0.65(3) mm(3), and a more widely used 2.0(3) mm(3) isotropic resolutions at 7 T. The EPI data were acquired using simultaneous non-image- based optical moire phase tracking (MPT) of physical motion. The results showed that image-based motion detection, performed by SPM8 software package, may be erroneous in high-field fMRI data with partial brain coverage and can introduce spurious motion leading to false-positive and false-negative activation. Further analyses demonstrated that limited acquisition field of view has the dominant influence on the effect. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) implemented with real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) use fMRI time-courses from predefined regions of interest (ROIs). To reach best performances, localizer experiments and on-site expert supervision are required for ROI definition. To automate this step, we developed two unsupervised computational techniques based on the general linear model (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA) of rt-fMRI data, and compared their performances on a communication BCI. Approach. 3 T fMRI data of six volunteers were re-analyzed in simulated real-time. During a localizer run, participants performed three mental tasks following visual cues. During two communication runs, a letter-spelling display guided the subjects to freely encode letters by performing one of the mental tasks with a specific timing. GLM- and ICA-based procedures were used to decode each letter, respectively using compact ROIs and whole-brain distributed spatio-temporal patterns of fMRI activity, automatically defined from subject-specific or group-level maps. Main results. Letter-decoding performances were comparable to supervised methods. In combination with a similarity-based criterion, GLM- and ICA-based approaches successfully decoded more than 80% (average) of the letters. Subject-specific maps yielded optimal performances. Significance. Automated solutions for ROI selection may help accelerating the translation of rt-fMRI BCIs from research to clinical applications.

Given rapid developments in both hardware and analysis tools, the field is now poised to study fMRI-derived measures in individual subjects, and to relate these to psychological traits or genetic variations. We discuss issues of validity, reliability and statistical assessment that arise when the focus shifts to individual subjects and that are applicable also to other imaging modalities. We emphasize that individual assessment of neural function with fMRI presents specific challenges and necessitates careful consideration of anatomical and vascular between-subject variability as well as sources of within-subject variability.

Over the last decade, functional MRI (fMRI) has emerged as a useful noninvasive tool for language lateralization, supplementing or replacing traditional invasive methods. In standard practice, fMRI-based language lateralization is assessed qualitatively by visual inspection of fMRI maps at a specific chosen activation threshold. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a new computational technique for providing the probability of each patient to be left, right, or bilateral dominant in language processing. METHODS In 76 patients with epilepsy, a language lateralization index was calculated using the verb-generation fMRI task over a wide range of activation thresholds (from a permissive threshold, analyzing all brain regions, to a harsh threshold, analyzing only the strongest activations). The data were classified using a probabilistic logistic regression method. RESULTS Concordant results between fMRI and Wada lateralization were observed in 89% of patients. Bilateral and right-dominant groups showed similar fMRI lateralization patterns differentiating them from the left-dominant group but still allowing classification in 82% of patients. CONCLUSIONS These findings present the utility of a semi-supervised probabilistic learning approach for presurgical language-dominance mapping, which may be extended to other cognitive domains such as memory and attention.

Using ultra-high field MRI increases the specificity and sensitivity, increasing the localization reliability and reducing scan time. Ideally, fMRI analysis for this application should identify unreliable runs and work even if the patient deviates from the prescribed task timing or if there are changes to the hemodynamic response due to pathology. In this study, a model-free analysis method-UNBIASED-based on the consistency of fMRI responses over runs was applied, to ultra-high field fMRI localizations of the hand area. Ten patients with brain tumors and epilepsy underwent 7 Tesla fMRI with multiple runs of a hand motor task in a block design. FMRI data were analyzed with the proposed approach (UNBIASED) and the conventional General Linear Model (GLM) approach. UNBIASED correctly identified and excluded fMRI runs that contained little or no activation. Generally, less motion artifact contamination was present in UNBIASED than in GLM results. Some cortical regions were identified as activated in UNBIASED but not GLM results. These were confirmed to show reproducible delayed or transient activation, which was time-locked to the task. UNBIASED is a robust approach to generating activation maps without the need for assumptions about response timing or shape. In presurgical planning, UNBIASED can complement model-based methods to aid surgeons in making prudent choices about optimal surgical access and resection margins for each patient, even if the hemodynamic response is modified by pathology.

Network-targeted approach and postoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging are associated with seizure outcome	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; CONNECTIVITY; SURGERY; ROBUST; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION	Objective Postoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with intractable epilepsy has not been quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its value as a biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood. Methods In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective resting-state seizure onset zone (SOZ)-targeted epilepsy surgery, postoperative resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the postoperative resting-state SOZ was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics. Results A total of 64 cases were evaluated. Network-targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs-fMRI normalization was significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with seizure reduction, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with postoperative rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, 38 (97%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5%) became seizure free. The accuracy of rs-fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94%, with 96% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Interpretation Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, network-targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs-fMRI normalization, has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study shows that rs-fMRI SOZ can be used as a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone, and postoperative rs-fMRI normalization is a biomarker for SOZ quiescence.

Contribution of systemic vascular effects to fMRI activity in white matter	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							DEVELOPMENTAL VENOUS ANOMALIES; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BOLD SIGNAL; HEART-RATE; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; OXYGENATION CHANGES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BLOOD-FLOW; SLEEP	To investigate a potential contribution of systemic physiology to recently reported BOLD fMRI signals in white matter, we compared photo-plethysmography (PPG) and whole-brain fMRI signals recorded simultaneously during long resting-state scans from an overnight sleep study. We found that intermittent drops in the amplitude of the PPG signal exhibited strong and widespread correlations with the fMRI signal, both in white matter (WM) and in gray matter (GM). The WM signal pattern resembled that seen in previous resting-state fMRI studies and closely tracked the location of medullary veins. Its temporal cross-correlation with the PPG amplitude was bipolar, with an early negative value. In GM, the correlation was consistently positive. Consistent with previous studies comparing physiological signals with fMRI, these findings point to a systemic vascular contribution to WM fMRI signals. The PPG drops are interpreted as systemic vasoconstrictive events, possibly related to intermittent increases in sympathetic tone related to fluctuations in arousal state. The counter-intuitive polarity of the WM signal is explained by long blood transit times in the medullary vasculature of WM, which cause blood oxygenation loss and a substantial timing mismatch between blood volume and blood oxygenation effects. A similar mechanism may explain previous findings of negative WM signals around large draining veins during both task-and resting-state fMRI.

This study investigates IEDs marked in EEGs corrected using information from a moire phase tracking (MPT) marker. Methods: EEG-fMRI from 18 patients was processed with conventional methods for BCG removal, while 9 patients used a MPT marker. IEDs were marked first without ECG information. In a second review, suspicious IEDs synchronous with the BCG were discarded. After each review, an event-related fMRI analysis was performed on the marked IEDs. Results: No difference was found in the proportion of suspicious IEDs in the 2 patient groups. However, the distribution of IED timings was significantly related to the cardiac cycle in 11 of 18 patients recorded without MPT marker, but only 2 of 9 patients with marker. In patients recorded without marker, failing to discard suspicious IEDs led to more inaccurate fMRI maps and more distant activations. Conclusions: BCG artifact correction based on MPT recordings allowed a more straightforward identification of IEDs that did not require ECG information in the large majority of patients. Significance: Marker-based ballistocardiographic artifact correction greatly facilitates the study of the generators of interictal discharges with EEG-fMRI.

Researchers have developed a variety of brain network analysis methods for task fMRI data, including the general linear model, independent component analysis, and sparse representation methods. However, these shallow models are limited in faithful reconstruction and modeling of the hierarchical and temporal structures of brain networks, as demonstrated in more and more studies. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit great ability of modeling hierarchical and temporal dependence features in the machine learning field, which might be suitable for task fMRI data modeling. To explore such possible advantages of RNNs for task fMRI data, we propose a novel framework of a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to model the functional brain networks from task fMRI data. Experimental results on the motor task fMRI data of Human Connectome Project 900 subjects release demonstrated that the proposed DRNN can not only faithfully reconstruct functional brain networks, but also identify more meaningful brain networks with multiple time scales which are overlooked by traditional shallow models. In general, this work provides an effective and powerful approach to identifying functional brain networks at multiple time scales from task fMRI data.

New methods to induce and control neuroplastic processes and correct abnormal function, or even shift functions from damaged tissue to physiologically healthy brain regions, hold the potential to dramatically improve overall health. Of the current neuroplastic interventions in development, neurofeedback training (NFT) from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has the advantages of being completely non-invasive, non-pharmacologic, and spatially localized to target brain regions, as well as having no known side effects. Furthermore, NFT techniques, initially developed using fMRI, can often be translated to exercises that can be performed outside of the scanner without the aid of medical professionals or sophisticated medical equipment. In fMRI NFT, the fMRI signal is measured from specific regions of the brain, processed, and presented to the participant in real-time. Through training, self-directed mental processing techniques, that regulate this signal and its underlying neurophysiologic correlates, are developed. FMRI NFT has been used to train volitional control over a wide range of brain regions with implications for several different cognitive, behavioral, and motor systems. Additionally, fMRI NFT has shown promise in a broad range of applications such as the treatment of neurologic disorders and the augmentation of baseline human performance. In this article, we present an fMRI NFT protocol developed at our institution for modulation of both healthy and abnormal brain function, as well as examples of using the method to target both cognitive and auditory regions of the brain.

This presents opportunities for new discoveries, but also for the rapid spread of questionable practices. Here, we look to the future of fMRI in communication science: first, highlighting and advocating for several relatively new methods that should enable communication scholars to address novel research questions; and second, pointing out various controversies or pitfalls that exist in the use of several of the more widely used fMRI analysis methods within the field. Given the rapidly changing nature of the fMRI analysis landscape, such reflection is an essential part of being a good scholar in this domain. Our aim is to ensure that the future of fMRI in communication science is healthy, robust, and rich in variety, by encouraging all researchers in the field to think critically about the methods they use, whether that means adopting new analysis methods that can answer previously unanswerable questions, or adjusting their use of methods they already use to align with the latest recommended practices.

Here we report a novel sustainable anesthesia procedure for small animal neuroimaging that overcomes shortcomings of anesthetics commonly used in rodent fMRI. The significantly improved preservation of cerebrovascular dynamics enhances sensitivity to neural activity changes for which it serves as a proxy in fMRI readouts. Excellent cross-species/strain applicability provides coherence among preclinical findings and is expected to improve translation to clinical fMRI investigations. The novel anesthesia procedure based on the GABAergic anesthetic etomidate was extensively validated in fMRI studies conducted in a range of genetically engineered rodent models of autism and strains commonly used for transgenic manipulations. Etomidate proved effective, yielded long-term stable physiology with basal cerebral blood flow of similar to 0.5 ml/g/min and full recovery. Cerebrovascular responsiveness of up to 180% was maintained as demonstrated with perfusion-and BOLD-based fMRI upon hypercapnic, pharmacological and sensory stimulation. Hence, etomidate lends itself as an anesthetic-of-choice for translational neuroimaging studies across rodent models of brain disorders.

With the emergence of dynamic connectivity and its ability to provide a much richer characterization of brain function compared to static measures, fast fMRI may yet play a crucial role in tracking dynamically varying networks. In spite of the dominance of slow hemodynamic contributions to the BOLD signal, high temporal sampling rates nevertheless improve the measurement of physiological noise, yielding an exceptional sensitivity for the detection of periods of transient connectivity at time scales of a few tens of seconds. There is also evidence that relevant BOLD fluctuations are detectable at high frequencies, implying that the benefits of fast fMRI extend beyond the ability to sample nuisance confounds. Here we review the latest technological advancements that have established fast fMRI as an effective acquisition technique, as well as its current and future implications on the analysis of dynamic networks.

Subcortical evidence for a contribution of arousal to fMRI studies of brain activity	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; GLOBAL SIGNAL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NUCLEUS BASALIS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; CHOLINERGIC INNERVATION; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS	Cortical activity during periods of rest is punctuated by widespread, synchronous events in both electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals, but their behavioral relevance remains unclear. Here we report that these events correspond to momentary drops in cortical arousal and are associated with activity changes in the basal forebrain and thalamus. Combining fMRI and electrophysiology in macaques, we first establish that fMRI transients co-occur with spectral shifts in local field potentials (LFPs) toward low frequencies. Applying this knowledge to fMRI data from the human connectome project, we find that the fMRI transients are strongest in sensory cortices. Surprisingly, the positive cortical transients occur together with negative transients in focal subcortical areas known to be involved with arousal regulation, most notably the basal forebrain. This subcortical involvement, combined with the prototypical pattern of LFP spectral shifts, suggests that commonly observed widespread variations in fMRI cortical activity are associated with momentary drops in arousal.

This prior information, which can be converted into a constraint of smoothness on the learned dictionary atoms, has seldomly been included in classical dictionary learning algorithms when applied to fMRI data analysis. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing two new sequential dictionary learning algorithms dedicated to fMRI data analysis by accounting for this prior information. These algorithms differ fromthe existing ones in their dictionary update stage. The steps of this stage are derived as a variant of the power method for computing the SVD. The proposed algorithms generate regularized dictionary atoms via the solution of a left regularized rank-one matrix approximation problem where temporal smoothness is enforced via regularization through basis expansion and sparse basis expansion in the dictionary update stage. Applications on synthetic data experiments and real fMRI data sets illustrating the performance of the proposed algorithms are provided.

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/ tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal).

The promises of these two projects were to model the complex interaction of brain and behavior and to understand and diagnose brain diseases by collecting and analyzing large quanitites of data. Archiving, analyzing, and sharing the growing neuroimaging datasets posed major challenges. New computational methods and technologies have emerged in the domain of Big Data but have not been fully adapted for use in neuroimaging. In this work, we introduce the current challenges of neuroimaging in a big data context. We review our efforts toward creating a data management system to organize the large-scale fMRI datasets, and present our novel algorithms/methods for the distributed fMRI data processing that employs Hadoop and Spark. Finally, we demonstrate the significant performance gains of our algorithms/methods to perform distributed dictionary learning.

The temporally constrained independent component analysis (TCICA) is capable of automatically extracting the desired spatially independent components by adding the temporal prior information of the task to the mixing matrix for fMRI data analysis. However, the TCICA method can only extract a single component that tends to be a mix of multiple task-related components when there exist several independent components related to one task.MethodsIn this study, we proposed a TCICA with threshold (TCICA-Thres) method that performed TCICA outside the threshold and performed FastICA inside the threshold to automatically extract all the target components related to one task. The proposed approach was tested using simulated fMRI data and was applied to a real fMRI experiment using 13 subjects. Additionally, the performance of TCICA-Thres was compared with that of FastICA and TCICA.ResultsThe results from the simulation and the fMRI data demonstrated that TCICA-Thres better extracted the task-related components than TCICA. Moreover, TCICA-Thres outperformed FastICA in robustness to noise, spatial detection power and computational time.ConclusionsThe proposed TCICA-Thres solves the limitations of TCICA and extends the application of TCICA in fMRI data analysis.

Despite this, it has not yet been thoroughly established how commonly reported fMRI readouts evolve over several hours of medetomidine anesthesia and how they are affected by the precise timing, dose, and route of administration. We used four different protocols of medetomidine administration to anesthetize rats for up to six hours and repeatedly evaluated somatosensory stimulus-evoked BOLD responses and resting state functional connectivity. We found that the temporal evolution of fMRI readouts strongly depended on the method of administration. Intravenous administration of a medetomidine bolus (0.05 mg/kg), combined with a subsequent continuous infusion (0.1 mg/kg/h), led to temporally stable measures of stimulus-evoked activity and functional connectivity throughout the anesthesia. Deviating from the above protocol-by omitting the bolus, lowering the medetomidine dose, or using the subcutaneous route-compromised the stability of these measures in the initial two-hour period. We conclude that both an appropriate protocol of medetomidine administration and a suitable timing of fMRI experiments are crucial for obtaining consistent results. These factors should be considered for the design and interpretation of future rat fMRI studies.

Thus, it is important for doctors in primary care settings to be well acquainted with the present and potential future applications, as well as limitations, of this modality. Objective The objective of this article is to introduce the theoretical principles and state-of-the-art clinical applications of fMRI in brain tumour and epilepsy surgery, with a focus on the implications for clinical primary care. Discussion fMRI enables non-invasive functional mapping of specific cortical tasks (eg motor, language, memory-based, visual), revealing information about functional localisation, anatomical variation in cortical function, and disease effects and adaptations, including the fascinating phenomenon of brain plasticity. fMRI is currently ordered by specialist neurologists and neurosurgeons for the purposes of pre-surgical assessment, and within the context of an experienced multidisciplinary team to prepare, conduct and interpret the scan. With an increasing number of patients undergoing fMRI, general practitioners can expect questions about the current and emerging role of fMRI in clinical care from these patients and their families.

High-Resolution CBV-fMRI Allows Mapping of Laminar Activity and Connectivity of Cortical Input and Output in Human M1	NEURON			English	Article							MOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN-BRAIN; 7 T; VISUAL-CORTEX; SPIN-ECHO; BOLD; SIGNAL; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES	Layer-dependent fMRI allows measurements of information flow in cortical circuits, as afferent and efferent connections terminate in different cortical layers. However, it is unknown to what level human fMRI is specific and sensitive enough to reveal directional functional activity across layers. To answer this question, we developed acquisition and analysis methods for blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-based laminar fMRI and used these to discriminate four different tasks in the human motor cortex (M1). In agreement with anatomical data from animal studies, we found evidence for somatosensory and premotor input in superficial layers of M1 and for cortico-spinal motor output in deep layers. Laminar resting-state fMRI showed directional functional connectivity of M1 with somatosensory and premotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that CBV-fMRI can be used to investigate cortical activity in humans with unprecedented detail, allowing investigations of information flow between brain regions and outperforming conventional BOLD results that are often buried under vascular biases.

A Free-breathing fMRI Method to Study Human Olfactory Function	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 125; Olfaction; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); olfactometer; odorant; respiration; neuroscience; imaging	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ODOR; IDENTIFICATION; STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; NETWORK; CORTEX	The study of human olfaction is a highly complex and valuable field with applications ranging from biomedical research to clinical evaluation. Currently, evaluation of the functions of the human central olfactory system with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is still a challenge because of several technical difficulties. There are some significant variables to take into account when considering an effective method for mapping the function of the central olfactory system using fMRI, including proper odorant selection, the interaction between odor presentation and respiration, and potential anticipation of or habituation to odorants. An event-related, respiration-triggered olfactory fMRI technique can accurately administer odorants to stimulate the olfactory system while minimizing potential interference. It can effectively capture the precise onsets of fMRI signals in the primary olfactory cortex using our data post-processing method. The technique presented here provides an efficient and practical means for generating reliable olfactory fMRI results. Such a technique can ultimately be applied in the clinical realm as a diagnostic tool for diseases associated with olfactory degeneration, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as we begin to further understand the complexities of the human olfactory system.

A meta-analytic comparison between deception and false memory studies	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Deception; false memory; fMRI; meta-analysis	CORRELATES UNDERLYING TRUE; SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; RESPONSE-RELATED FMRI; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LIE-DETECTION; CONCEALED INFORMATION; ILLUSORY RECOGNITION; NEURAL ACTIVITY	Previous research has highlighted the potential of fMRI in discriminating between truth and falsehood. However, falsehoods may not necessarily represent a deliberate intention to deceive; they can be a result of false memory too. It is important to show that fMRI can discriminate between deception and false memory, before it can be applied in legal contexts for deception detection. To this end, we performed a meta-analytic comparison of brain activation between deception and false memory. Activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses were conducted separately on 49 deception (61 contrasts; N-total = 991) and 28 false memory (32 contrasts; N-total = 484) studies. The contrasts obtained from these meta-analyses were entered into subsequent conjunction and contrast analyses. Deception and false memory tasks activated several frontoparietal regions. Both tasks activated the left superior frontal gyrus. Deception, relative to false memory, was associated with increased activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, right insula, left inferior parietal lobule and right superior frontal gyros. These results provide some evidence to suggest that fMRI can discriminate between deception and false memory.	[Yu, Junhong; Lee, Tatia M.

Little emphasis has been put on the influence of cognitive and personality traits on neurofeedback efficacy and baseline activity. Here, we assessed the effect of individual pain coping on rt-fMRI neurofeedback during heat-induced pain. Twenty-eight healthy subjects completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) prior to scanning. The first part of the fMRI experiment identified target regions using painful heat stimulation. Then, subjects were asked to down-regulate the pain target brain region during four neurofeedback runs with painful heat stimulation. Functional MRI analysis included correlation analysis between fMRI activation and pain ratings as well as CSQ ratings. At the behavioral level, the active pain coping (first principal component of CSQ) was correlated with pain ratings during neurofeedback. Concerning neuroimaging, pain sensitive regions were negatively correlated with pain coping. During neurofeedback, the pain coping was positively correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and visual cortex. Thermode temperature was negatively correlated with anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation. In conclusion, self-reported pain coping mechanisms and pain sensitivity are a source of variance during rt-fMRI neurofeedback possibly explaining variations in regulation success. In particular, active coping seems to be associated with successful pain regulation.

The senses influence each other during multisensory stimulation and can be both suppressive and super-additive. As most knowledge of human olfactory perception is derived from functional neuroimaging studies, in particular fMRI, our current understanding of olfactory perception has systematically been investigated in an environment with concurrent loud sounds. To date, the confounding effects of acoustic fMRI-noise during scanning on olfactory perception have not yet been investigated. In this study we investigate how acoustic noise derived from the rapid switching of MR gradient coils, affects olfactory perception. For this, 50 subjects were tested in both a silent setting and an fMRI-noise setting, in a randomised order. We found that fMRI-related acoustic noise had a significant negative effect on the olfactory detection threshold score. No significant effects were identified on olfactory discrimination, identification, identification certainty, hedonic rating, or intensity rating. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains unclear whether and how endogenous serotonergic transmission specifically influences regional or global functional activity. We combined designed receptors exclusively activated by designed drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), an approach we term "chemo-fMRI,'' to causally probe the brain-wide substrates modulated by endogenous serotonergic activity. We describe the generation of a conditional knockin mouse line that, crossed with serotonin-specific Cre-recombinase mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic neurons during fMRI scans. We show that endogenous stimulation of serotonin-producing neurons does not affect global brain activity but results in region-specific activation of a set of primary target regions encompassing corticohippocampal and ventrostriatal areas. By contrast, pharmacological boosting of serotonin levels produced widespread fMRI deactivation, plausibly reflecting the mixed contribution of central and perivascular constrictive effects. Our results identify the primary functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation and establish causation between activation of serotonergic neurons and regional fMRI signals.

The potential of real-time fMRI neurofeedback for stroke rehabilitation: A systematic review	CORTEX			English	Review						fMRI; Neurofeedback; Brain injury; Neuropsychology; Rehabilitation; Stroke	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR CORTEX ACTIVITY; SELF-REGULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LEARNED REGULATION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; VISUAL AREAS; IMAGERY; FEEDBACK; ACTIVATION	Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback aids the modulation of neural functions by training self-regulation of brain activity through operant conditioning. This technique has been applied to treat several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, but its effectiveness for stroke rehabilitation has not been examined yet. Here, we systematically review the effectiveness of rt-fMRI neurofeedback training in modulating motor and cognitive processes that are often impaired after stroke. Based on predefined search criteria, we selected and examined 33 rt-fMRI neurofeedback studies, including 651 healthy individuals and 15 stroke patients in total. The results of our systematic review suggest that rt-fMRI neurofeedback training can lead to a learned modulation of brain signals, with associated changes at both the neural and the behavioural level. However, more research is needed to establish how its use can be optimized in the context of stroke rehabilitation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is involved in the metabolism of dopamine. It is reported that both of these can be used to assess the aggression risk in patients with schizophrenia. However, these methods to assess the aggression risk patients with schizophrenia have not been established in China. Therefore, we deliver here a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the studies dealing with Chinese patients. Method: Nine fMRI studies and 12 gene studies were included. The data of each study were extracted and summarized. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated on allele, dominant, and recessive models. Publication bias was evaluated by Begg's funnel plot. Results: Positive BOLD-fMRI values in the lower central neural system (CNS) and negative values in the high-level CNS were observed in the patients with aggression risk. A strong association was derived from the recessive gene model of COMT polymorphism rs4680 and risk in aggression behavior (odds ratio = 2.10). No significant publication bias was identified. Conclusion: Aggression behavior in patients with schizophrenia can be indicated by positive BOLD-fMRI values in the lower CNS and negative values in the high-level CNS and by a recessive gene model in COMT polymorphism rs4680. A combined test of fMRI and COMT gene could increase the predictive value.

Thus, this review summarizes the research that has applied fMRI cue-reactivity paradigms to the study of adult substance use disorder treatment responses. Studies utilizing fMRI cue-reactivity paradigms for the prediction of relapse and as a means to investigate psychosocial and pharmacological treatment effects on cue-elicited brain activation are presented within four primary categories of substances: alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and opioids. Lastly, suggestions for how to leverage fMRI technology to advance addiction science and treatment development are provided.	[Courtney, Kelly E.; Roche, Daniel J.

Methodological considerations in assessment of language lateralisation with fMRI: a systematic review	PEERJ			English	Review						Language; Lateralisation; fMRI; Systematicreview	FUNCTIONAL MRI; HEMISPHERIC LATERALIZATION; ARCUATE FASCICULUS; LEFT-HANDERS; BRAIN-TUMOR; DOMINANCE; TASK; ACTIVATION; ASYMMETRY; INDEX	The involvement of the right and left hemispheres in mediating language functions has been measured in a variety of ways over the centuries since the relative dominance of the left hemisphere was first known. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) presents a useful non-invasive method of assessing lateralisation that is being increasingly used in clinical practice and research. However, the methods used in the fMRI laterality literature currently are highly variable, making systematic comparisons across studies difficult. Here we consider the different methods of quantifying and classifying laterality that have been used in fMRI studies since 2000, with the aim of determining which give the most robust and reliable measurement. Recommendations are made with a view to informing future research to increase standardisation in fMRI laterality protocols. In particular, the findings reinforce the importance of threshold-independent methods for calculating laterality indices, and the benefits of assessing heterogeneity of language laterality across multiple regions of interest and tasks.

Our approach directly parameterizes temporal dynamics through recurrent connections, which can be used to formulate blind source separation with a conditional (rather than marginal) independence assumption, which we call RNN-ICA. This formulation enables us to visualize the temporal dynamics of both first order (activity) and second order (directed connectivity) information in brain networks that are widely studied in a static sense, but not well-characterized dynamically. RNN-ICA predicts dynamics directly from the recurrent states of the RNN in both task and resting state fMRI. Our results show both task-related and group-differentiating directed connectivity.

However, the fundamental questions in regards to fMRI technology: how the BOLD signal inferences the underlying microscopic neuronal activity and physiological changes and what is the ultimate specificity of fMRI for functional mapping of microcircuits, remain unanswered. The capability of simultaneous fMRI measurement and functional microscopic imaging in a live brain thus holds the key to link the microscopic and mesoscopic neural dynamics to the macroscopic brain activity at the central nervous system level. Here we report the first demonstration to integrate high-resolution two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPM) with a 16.4 tesla MRI system, which proves the concept and feasibility for performing simultaneous high-resolution fMRI and TPM imaging at ultrahigh magnetic field.

Traditionally, task-based fMRI has been applied to study specific cognitive functions, providing information on disease-related alterations and regarding the physiological bases of normal cognition, the dopaminergic system, and the frontostriatal circuits. More recently, functional connectivity techniques using resting-state fMRI data have been developed. Unconstrained by specific cognitive tasks, these techniques allow assessing whole-brain patterns of connectivity believed to be useful proxies for the underlying functional architecture of the brain. These methods have shown that different types of Parkinson's disease-related cognitive deficits are associated with patterns of altered connectivity within and between resting-state intrinsic connectivity networks. Although methodological standardization and the vulnerability of fMRI techniques to artifacts mandate further technical refinement, early studies provide encouraging results regarding the potential of fMRI-derived parameters for the ultimate goal of individual-subject classification.

Otherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be under-estimated resulting in increased false-positive rates. Serial correlations in fMRI data are commonly characterized in terms of a first-order autoregressive (AR) process and then removed via pre-whitening. The required noise model for the pre-whitening depends on a number of parameters, particularly the repetition time (TR). Here we investigate how the sub-second temporal resolution provided by simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging changes the noise structure in fMRI time series. We fit a higher-order AR model and then estimate the optimal AR model order for a sequence with a TR of less than 600 ms providing whole brain coverage. We show that physiological noise modelling successfully reduces the required AR model order, but remaining serial correlations necessitate an advanced noise model. We conclude that commonly used noise models, such as the AR(1) model, are inadequate for modelling serial correlations in fMRI using sub-second TRs. Rather, physiological noise modelling in combination with advanced pre-whitening schemes enable valid inference in single-subject analysis using fast fMRI sequences.

Human trials, animal models, and computational models suggest structural traits and functional states of neural systems are the major sources of this variance. There are 118 published tDCS studies (up to October 1, 2018) that used fMRI as a proxy measure of neural activation to answer mechanistic, predictive, and localization questions about how brain activity is modulated by tDCS. FMRI can potentially contribute as: a measure of cognitive state-level variance in baseline brain activation before tDCS; inform the design of stimulation montages that aim to target functional networks during specific tasks; and act as an outcome measure of functional response to tDCS. In this systematic review, we explore methodological parameter space of tDCS integration with fMRI spanning: (a) fMRI timing relative to tDCS (pre, post, concurrent); (b) study design (parallel, crossover); (c) control condition (sham, active control); (d) number of tDCS sessions; (e) number of follow up scans; (f) stimulation dose and combination with task; (g) functional imaging sequence (BOLD, ASL, resting); and (h) additional behavioral (cognitive, clinical) or quantitative (neurophysiological, biomarker) measurements. Existing tDCS-fMRI literature shows little replication across these permutations; few studies used comparable study designs. Here, we use a representative sample study with both task and resting state fMRI before and after tDCS in a crossover design to discuss methodological confounds. We further outline how computational models of current flow should be combined with imaging data to understand sources of variability. Through the representative sample study, we demonstrate how modeling and imaging methodology can be integrated for individualized analysis. Finally, we discuss the importance of conducting tDCS-fMRI with stimulation equipment certified as safe to use inside the MR scanner, and of correcting for image artifacts caused by tDCS. tDCS-fMRI can address important questions on the functional mechanisms of tDCS action (e.g., target engagement) and has the potential to support enhancement of behavioral interventions, provided studies are designed rationally.

Non-invasive imaging of brain networks, however, requires the application of methods such as blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is commonly used for functional neuroimaging. While BOLD fMRI provides brain-wide non-invasive reading of the hemodynamic response, it is only an indirect measure of neural activity. Direct observation of neural responses requires electrophysiological or optical methods. The latter can be combined with optogenetic control of neuronal circuits and are MRI compatible. Yet, simultaneous optical recordings are still limited to fiber-optic-based approaches. Here, we review the integration of optical recordings and optogenetic manipulation into fMRI experiments. As a practical example, we describe how BOLD fMRI in a 9.4-T small animal MR scanner can be combined with in vivo fiber-optic calcium recordings and optogenetic control in a multimodal setup. We present simultaneous BOLD fMRI and calcium recordings under optogenetic control in rat. We outline details about MR coil configuration, choice, and usage of opsins and chemically and genetically encoded calcium sensors, fiber implantation, appropriate light power for stimulation, and calcium signal detection, to provide a glimpse into challenges and opportunities of this multimodal molecular neuroimaging approach.

As different perspective on the same magnetic source, fMRI magnitude and phase data are complementary for brain function analysis. We collected 600-subject fMRI data during rest, decomposed via group-level independent component analysis (ICA) (mICA and pICA for magnitude and phase respectively), and calculated brain functional network connectivity matrices (mFC and pFC). The pFC matrix shows a fewer of significant connections balancedacross positive and negative relationships. In comparison, the mFC matrix contains a positively-biased pattern with more significant connections. Our experiment data analyses also show that human brain maintains a whole-brain connection balance in resting state across an age span from 10 to 76years, however, phase and magnitude data analyses reveal different connection-specific age effects on significant positive and negative subnetwork couplings.

Ultra-high field MRI reveals mood-related circuit disturbances in depression: a comparison between 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; FMRI TIME-SERIES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CINGULATE CORTEX; 7 T; BOLD; SEGREGATION; RESOLUTION; SCALE	Ultra-high field 7-Tesla (7 T) MRI has the potential to advance our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). To date, few studies have quantified the advantage of resting state functional MRI (fMRI) at 7 T compared to 3-Tesla (3 T). We conducted a series of experiments that demonstrate the improvement in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of a multi-echo multi-band fMRI protocol with ultra-high field 7 T MRI, compared to a similar protocol using 3 T MRI in healthy controls (HC). We also directly tested the enhancement in ultra-high field 7 T fMRI signal power by examining the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a small midbrain structure that is critical to the expected neuropathology of MDD but difficult to discern with standard 3 T MRI. We demonstrate up to 300% improvement in TSNR and resting state functional connectivity coefficients provided by ultra-high field 7 T fMRI compared to 3 T, indicating enhanced power for detection of functional neural architecture. A multi-echo based acquisition protocol and signal denoising pipeline afforded greater gain in signal power compared to classic acquisition and denoising pipelines. Furthermore, ultra-high field fMRI revealed mood-related neurocircuit disturbances in patients with MDD compared to HC, which were not detectable with 3 T fMRI. Ultra-high field 7 T fMRI may provide an effective tool for studying functional neural architecture relevant to MDD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Methods: A BOLD-sensitive fMRI pulse sequence was designed that first generates T-2-weighted magnetization (using a T-2 preparation module) and subsequently undergoes three-dimensional (3D) radial encoding using a rotating ultrafast imaging sequence (RUFIS). The method was tested on healthy volunteers at 3T with motor, visual, and auditory tasks, and compared relative to standard gradient and spin echo planar imaging (EPI) methods. Results: In combination with parallel imaging the method achieves efficient and robust 3D whole brain coverage (3 mm isotropic resolution in 2.65 s scan time). Compared with standard EPI-based fMRI, the method demonstrated 1) T-2-weighted imaging clean of geometrical distortions and signal dropout, 2) an acoustic noise reduction of similar to 40 dB(A), and 3) a consistent BOLD response that is less sensitive (similar to 1.3% BOLD change) but spatially more specific. Conclusion: T-2-prepared RUFIS provides quiet and distortion-free whole brain BOLD fMRI with minimal demands on the gradient performance. In particular, auditory fMRI and/or studies involving brain regions near air-tissue interfaces are expected to greatly benefit from the proposed method, especially if performed at ultrahigh field strengths.

Let's Not Waste Time: Using Temporal Information in Clustered Activity Estimation with Spatial Adjacency Restrictions (CAESAR) for Parcellating FMRI Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL PARCELLATION; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY	We have proposed a Bayesian approach for functional parcellation of whole-brain FMRI measurements which we call Clustered Activity Estimation with Spatial Adjacency Restrictions (CAESAR). We use distance-dependent Chinese restaurant processes (dd-CRPs) to define a flexible prior which partitions the voxel measurements into clusters whose number and shapes are unknown a priori. With dd-CRPs we can conveniently implement spatial constraints to ensure that our parcellations remain spatially contiguous and thereby physiologically meaningful. In the present work, we extend CAESAR by using Gaussian process (GP) priors to model the temporally smooth haemodynamic signals that give rise to the measured FMRI data. A challenge for GP inference in our setting is the cubic scaling with respect to the number of time points, which can become computationally prohibitive with FMRI measurements, potentially consisting of long time series. As a solution we describe an efficient implementation that is practically as fast as the corresponding time-independent non-GP model with typically-sized FMRI data sets. We also employ a population Monte-Carlo algorithm that can significantly speed up convergence compared to traditional single-chain methods. First we illustrate the benefits of CAESAR and the GP priors with simulated experiments. Next, we demonstrate our approach by parcellating resting state FMRI data measured from twenty participants as taken from the Human Connectome Project data repository. Results show that CAESAR affords highly robust and scalable whole-brain clustering of FMRI timecourses.	[Janssen, Ronald J.; Jylanki, Pasi; van Gerven, Marcel A.

Unexpected global impact of VTA dopamine neuron activation as measured by opto-fMRI	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALCOHOL-USE; BRAIN; STRIATUM; BOLD; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PROJECTIONS; RESPONSES	Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are strongly implicated in cognitive and affective processing as well as in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse disorders. In human studies, dopamine-related functions are routinely assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of blood oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during the performance of dopamine-dependent tasks. There is, however, a critical void in our knowledge about whether and how activation of VTA dopamine neurons specifically influences regional or global fMRI signals. Here, we used optogenetics in Th:: Cre rats to selectively stimulate VTA dopamine neurons while simultaneously measuring global hemodynamic changes using BOLD and cerebral blood volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI. Phasic activation of VTA dopamine neurons increased BOLD and CBVw fMRI signals in VTA-innervated limbic regions, including the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens). Surprisingly, basal ganglia regions that receive sparse or no VTA dopaminergic innervation, including the dorsal striatum and the globus pallidus, were also activated. In fact, the most prominent fMRI signal increase in the forebrain was observed in the dorsal striatum that is not traditionally associated with VTA dopamine neurotransmission. These data establish causation between phasic activation of VTA dopamine neurons and global fMRI signals. They further suggest that mesolimbic and non-limbic basal ganglia dopamine circuits are functionally connected and thus provide a potential novel framework for understanding dopamine-dependent functions and interpreting data obtained from human fMRI studies.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of patients in the months and years following stroke have given some insight into how the brain recovers lost functions. Initially, new pathways are recruited to compensate for the lost region, showing as a brighter blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal over a larger area during a task than in healthy controls. Subsequently, activity is reduced to baseline levels as pathways become more efficient, mimicking the process of learning typically seen during development. Preclinical models of ischemic stroke aim to enhance understanding of the biology underlying recovery following stroke. However, the pattern of recruitment and focusing seen in humans has not been observed in preclinical fMRI studies that are highly variable methodologically. Resting-state fMRI studies show more consistency; however, there are still confounding factors to address. Anesthesia and method of stroke induction are the two main sources of variability in preclinical studies; improvements here can reduce variability and increase the intensity and reproducibility of the BOLD response detected by fMRI. Differences in task or stimulus and differences in analysis method also present a source of variability. This review compares clinical and preclinical fMRI studies of recovery following stroke and focuses on how refinement of preclinical models and MRI methods may obtain more representative fMRI data in relation to human studies.

The main areas of the brain that are considered as belonging to the MNS are the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Many studies have tried to focus on the relationship between the regions belonging to the MNS, but a little consideration has been given to the study of the MNS in resting conditions. In the present experiment, the MNS has been studied by two fMRI modalities (task-based fMRI and resting-fMRI) and three analytical procedures [task-block comparison, functional connectivity (FC), and independent component analysis (ICA)]. The task-fMRI with block design showed a mirror activity located in the rostral IPL. The coordinates of this local maximum voxel were defined as a region of interest (ROI) for an FC analysis of the resting-fMRI. This analysis revealed the existence of a functional connectivity within regions forming the core of MNS network and also with other regions with mirror properties. Finally, resting-state fMRI ICA showed the same functional network, although it was more restricted to the core MNS regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that approaches the MNS using the resting-state fMRI analysis using independent component analysis and functional connectivity at the same time.

Improving the Test-Retest Reliability of Resting State fMRI by Removing the Impact of Sleep	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						test-retest reliability; resting state; naturalistic paradigm; heart rate variability; sleep	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; AUTONOMIC PROFILE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; GRAPH METRICS; EYES-OPEN; NETWORK; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX	Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful tool to examine large-scale neural networks in the human brain and their disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders. Thanks to its low demand and high tolerance, resting state paradigms can be easily acquired from clinical population. However, due to the unconstrained nature, resting state paradigm is associated with excessive head movement and proneness to sleep. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI measures is moderate at best, falling short of widespread use in the clinic. Here, we characterized the effect of sleep on the test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI. Using measures of heart rate variability (HRV) derived from simultaneous electrocardiogram(ECG) recording, we identified portions of fMRI data when subjects were more alert or sleepy, and examined their effects on the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures. When volumes of sleep were excluded, the reliability of rs-fMRI is significantly improved, and the improvement appears to be general across brain networks. The amount of improvement is robust with the removal of as much as 60% volumes of sleepiness. Therefore, test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI is affected by sleep and could be improved by excluding volumes of sleepiness as indexed by HRV. Our results suggest a novel and practical method to improve test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI measures.

J	Dang, S; Chaudhury, S; Lall, B; Roy, PK				Dang, Shilpa; Chaudhury, Santanu; Lall, Brejesh; Roy, Prasun Kumar			The dynamic programming high-order Dynamic Bayesian Networks learning for identifying effective connectivity in human brain from fMRI	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Bayesian-Dirichlet score; High-order dynamic bayesian network; Dynamic programming; Effective connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Structure learning	GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; MODEL	Background: Determination of effective connectivity (EC) among brain regions using fMRI is helpful in understanding the underlying neural mechanisms. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are an appropriate class of probabilistic graphical temporal-models that have been used in past to model EC from fMRI, specifically order-one. New-method: High-order DBNs (HO-DBNs) have still not been explored for fMRI data. A fundamental problem faced in the structure-learning of HO-DBN is high computational-burden and low accuracy by the existing heuristic search techniques used for EC detection from fMRI. In this paper, we propose using dynamic programming (DP) principle along with integration of properties of scoring-function in a way to reduce search space for structure-learning of HO-DBNs and finally, for identifying EC from fMRI which has not been done yet to the best of our knowledge. The proposed exact search-&-score learning approach HO-DBN-DP is an extension of the technique which was originally devised for learning a BN's structure from static data (Singh and Moore, 2005). Results: The effectiveness in structure-learning is shown on synthetic fMRI dataset. The algorithm reaches globally-optimal solution in appreciably reduced time-complexity than the static counterpart due to integration of properties. The proof of optimality is provided. Comparison: The results demonstrate that HO-DBN-DP is comparably more accurate and faster than currently used structure-learning algorithms used for identifying EC from fMRI. The real data EC from HO-DBN-DP shows consistency with previous literature than the classical Granger Causality method. Conclusion: Hence, the DP algorithm can be employed for reliable EC estimates from experimental fMRI data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Lag Structure of Intrinsic Activity is Focally Altered in High Functioning Adults with Autism	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						dynamics; neural communication; resting-state fMRI; systems	RESTING-STATE NETWORK; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; ORGANIZATION; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; FMRI; INTEGRATION	The behaviors that define autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been hypothesized to result from disordered communication within brain networks. Several groups have investigated this question using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). However, the published findings to date have been inconsistent across laboratories. Prior RS-fMRI studies of ASD have employed conventional analysis techniques based on the assumption that intrinsic brain activity is exactly synchronous over widely separated parts of the brain. By relaxing the assumption of synchronicity and focusing, instead, on lags between time series, we have recently demonstrated highly reproducible patterns of temporally lagged activity in normal human adults. We refer to this analysis technique as resting-state lag analysis (RS-LA). Here, we report RS-LA as well as conventional analyses of RS-fMRI in adults with ASD and demographically matched controls. RS-LA analyses demonstrated significant group differences in rs-fMRI lag structure in frontopolar cortex, occipital cortex, and putamen. Moreover, the degree of abnormality in individuals was highly correlated with behavioral measures relevant to the diagnosis of ASD. In this sample, no significant group differences were observed using conventional RS-fMRI analysis techniques. Our results suggest that altered propagation of intrinsic activity may contribute to abnormal brain function in ASD.

Here we use fMRI to guide source localization of the ERPs at different times for studying the temporal dynamics of the neural system for recognizing familiar faces. fMRI activation areas were defined in a previous experiment applying the same paradigm used for ERPs. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was used to estimate the generators of the ERPs to unfamiliar, visually familiar, and personally-familiar faces constraining the model by fMRI activation results. For this, higher prior probabilities in the solution space were assigned to the fMRI-defined regions, which included face-selective areas and other areas related to person knowledge retrieval. Source analysis was carried out in three-time windows: early (150-210ms), middle (300-380ms) and late (460-580ms). The early and middle responses were generated in fMRI-defined areas for all face categories, while these areas do not contribute to the late response. Different areas contributed to the generation of the early and middle ERPs elicited by unfamiliar faces: fusiform (Fus), inferior occipital, superior temporal sulcus and the posterior cingulate (PC) cortices. For familiar faces, the contributing areas were Fus, PC and anterior temporal areas for visually familiar faces, with the addition of the medial orbitofrontal areas and other frontal structures for personally-significant faces. For both unfamiliar and familiar faces, more extended and reliable involvement of contributing areas were obtained for the middle compare with early time window. Our fMRI guide ERP source analysis suggested the recruitment of person-knowledge processing areas as early as 150-210ms after stimulus onset during recognition of personally-familiar faces. We concluded that fMRI-constrained BMA source analysis provide information regarding the temporal-dynamics in the neural system for cognitive processsing.

Methods: A combined TMS/fMRI design was applied over the primary motor cortex based on 1 Hz stimulation with stimulation levels of 80%, 90%, 100%, and 110% of the individual active motor threshold, respectively. Due to the use of a multichannel receive coil we were able to use multiband-accelerated (MB=2) EPI sequences for the acquisition of functional images. Data were analysed with SPM12 and BOLD-weighted signal intensity time courses were extracted in each subject from two local maxima (individual functional finger tapping localiser, fixed MM coordinate of the hand knob) next to the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and from the global maximum. Results: We report excellent image quality without noticeable signal dropouts or image distortions. Parameter estimates in the three peak voxels showed monotonically ascending activation levels over increasing stimulation intensities. Across all subjects, mean BOLD signal changes for 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% of the individual active motor threshold were 0.43%, 0.63%, 1.01%, 2.01% next to the individual functional finger tapping maximum, 0.73%, 0.91%, 1.34%, 2.21% next to the MM-defined hand knob and 0.88%, 1.09%, 1.65%, 2.77% for the global maximum, respectively. Conclusion: Our results show that the new setup for concurrent TMS/fMRI experiments using a dedicated MR coil array allows for high-sensitivity fMRI particularly at the site of stimulation. Contrary to the standard birdcage approach, the results also demonstrate that the new coil can be successfully used for multibandaccelerated EPI acquisition. The gain in flexibility due to the new coil can be easily combined with neuronavigation within the MR scanner to allow for accurate targeting in TMS/fMRI experiments.	[de Lara, Lucia I.

In this article, we provide an overview of important considerations for longitudinal fMRI research in developmental samples, including task design, sampling strategies, and group-level analyses. We first discuss considerations for task designs, weighing the pros and cons of many commonly used tasks, as well as outlining how the tasks may be impacted by repeated exposure. Secondly, we review the types of group-level analyses that can be conducted on longitudinal fMRI data, analyses which must account for repeated measures. Finally, we review and critique recent longitudinal studies that have emerged in the past few years.

J	VanRullen, R; Reddy, L				VanRullen, Rufin; Reddy, Leila			Reconstructing faces from fMRI patterns using deep generative neural networks	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							REPRESENTATIONS; IMAGERY; CORTEX	Although distinct categories are reliably decoded from fMRI brain responses, it has proved more difficult to distinguish visually similar inputs, such as different faces. Here, we apply a recently developed deep learning system to reconstruct face images from human fMRI. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE) neural network using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised procedure over a large data set of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder latent space provides a meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional description of each image. We then presented several thousand faces to human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied this mapping to novel test images, translating fMRI patterns into VAE latent codes, and codes into face reconstructions. The system not only performed robust pairwise decoding(> 95% correct), but also accurate gender classification, and even decoded which face was imagined, rather than seen.

Brain Atrophy Can Introduce Age-Related Differences in BOLD Response	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						hemodynamic impulse response function; fMRI; aging; native space; spatial normalization; registration	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXYGENATION CHANGES; ELDERLY ADULTS; HEALTHY-YOUNG; SIGNAL; STIMULATION	Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in studies of aging is often hampered by uncertainty about age-related differences in the amplitude and timing of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response (i.e., hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF)). Such uncertainty introduces a significant challenge in the interpretation of the fMRI results. Even though this issue has been extensively investigated in the field of neuroimaging, there is currently no consensus about the existence and potential sources of age-related hemodynamic alterations. Using an event-related fMRI experiment with two robust and well-studied stimuli (visual and auditory), we detected a significant age-related difference in the amplitude of response to auditory stimulus. Accounting for brain atrophy by circumventing spatial normalization and processing the data in subjects' native space eliminated these observed differences. In addition, we simulated fMRI data using age differences in brain morphology while controlling HRF shape. Analyzing these simulated fMRI data using standard image processing resulted in differences in HRF amplitude, which were eliminated when the data were analyzed in subjects' native space. Our results indicate that age-related atrophy introduces inaccuracy in co-registration to standard space, which subsequently appears as attenuation in BOLD response amplitude. Our finding could explain some of the existing contradictory reports regarding age-related differences in the fMRI BOLD responses. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Albers, F; Wachsmuth, L; Schache, D; Lambers, H; Faber, C				Albers, Franziska; Wachsmuth, Lydia; Schache, Daniel; Lambers, Henriette; Faber, Cornelius			Functional MRI Readouts From BOLD and Diffusion Measurements Differentially Respond to Optogenetic Activation and Tissue Heating	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional diffusion; optogenetics; BOLD; heating artifacts; small animal MRI	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NEURONAL ACTIVATION; WEIGHTED FMRI; HUMAN BRAIN; SPIN-ECHO; LIGHT; STIMULATION; CORTEX; WATER; NETWORK	Functional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI provides a brain-wide readout that depends on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity. Diffusion fMRI has been proposed as an alternative to BOLD fMRI and has been postulated to directly rely on neuronal activity. These complementary functional readouts are versatile tools to be combined with optogenetic stimulation to investigate networks of the brain. The cell-specificity and temporal precision of optogenetic manipulations promise to enable further investigation of the origin of fMRI signals. The signal characteristics of the diffusion fMRI readout vice versa may better resolve network effects of optogenetic stimulation. However, the light application needed for optogenetic stimulation is accompanied by heat deposition within the tissue. As both diffusion and BOLD are sensitive to temperature changes, light application can lead to apparent activations confounding the interpretation of fMRI data. The degree of tissue heating, the appearance of apparent activation in different fMRI sequences and the origin of these phenomena are not well understood. Here, we disentangled apparent activations in BOLD and diffusion measurements in rats from physiological activation upon sensory or optogenetic stimulation. Both, BOLD and diffusion fMRI revealed similar signal shapes upon sensory stimulation that differed clearly from those upon heating. Apparent activations induced by high-intensity light application were dominated by T-2*-effects and resulted in mainly negative signal changes. We estimated that even low-intensity light application used for optogenetic stimulation reduces the BOLD response close to the fiber by up to 0.4%. The diffusion fMRI signal contained T-2, T-2* and diffusion components. The apparent diffusion coefficient, which reflects the isolated diffusion component, showed negative changes upon both optogenetic and electric forepaw stimulation. In contrast, positive changes were detected upon high-intensity light application and thus ruled out heating as a major contributor to the diffusion fMRI signal.

Network Changes after Epilepsy Surgery: It's Time to Reconnect	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							CONNECTIVITY	Network-Targeted Approach and Postoperative Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Are Associated With Seizure Outcome Boerwinkle VL, Cediel EG, Mirea L, et al. Ann Neurol. 2019;86(3):344-356. Objective: Postoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with intractable epilepsy has not been quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its value as a biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood. Methods: In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective resting-state seizure onset zone (SOZ)-targeted epilepsy surgery, postoperative resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the postoperative resting-state SOZ was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics. Results: A total of 64 cases were evaluated. Network-targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs-fMRI normalization was significantly (P < .001) correlated with seizure reduction, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with postoperative rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, 38 (97%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete rs-fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5%) became seizure free. The accuracy of rs-fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94%, with 96% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Interpretation: Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, network-targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs-fMRI normalization, has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study shows that rs-fMRI SOZ can be used as a biomarker for the epileptogenic zone, and postoperative rs-fMRI normalization is a biomarker for SOZ quiescence.

However, space-occupying lesions may lead to functional reorganization or decreased BOLD activity. Methods Therefore in 13 patients with cerebral gliomas or brain arterio-venous malformations/hemangioma fMRI- and MEG-based cortical localizations of motor and somatosensory cortical activation pattern were compared in order to investigate their congruency. Results Localization of cortical sensorimotor areas with fMRI and MEG showed good congruency with a mean spatial distance of around 10 mm, with differences depending on the localization method. The smallest mean differences for the centroids were found for MEF with MNE 8 mm and SEF with sLORETA 8 mm. Primary motor area (M1) reorganization was found in 5 of 12 patients in fMRI and confirmed with MEG data. In these 5 patients with M1-reorganization the distance between the border of the fMRI-based cortical M1-localization and the tumor border on Tlw MR images varied between 0-4 mm, which was significant (P = 0.025) different to the distance in glioma patients without M1-reorganization (5-26 mm). Conclusion Our multimodal preoperative mapping approach combining fMRI and MEG reveals a high degree of spatial congruence and provided high evidence for the presence of motor cortex reorganization.

Phase-synchronization-based parcellation of resting state fMRI signals reveals topographically organized clusters in early visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Resting state fMRI; Visual cortex; Phase synchronization	FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; SPATIAL INTERACTION; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; FLUCTUATIONS; REPRESENTATIONS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; ABSENCE	Resting-state fMRI is widely used to study brain function and connectivity. However, interpreting patterns of resting state (RS) fMRI activity remains challenging as they may arise from different neuronal mechanisms than those triggered by exogenous events. Currently, this limits the use of RS-fMRI for understanding cortical function in health and disease. Here, we examine the phase synchronization (PS) properties of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals obtained during visual field mapping (VFM) and RS with 7T fMRI. This data-driven approach exploits spatiotemporal covariations in the phase of BOLD recordings to establish the presence of clusters of synchronized activity. We find that, in both VFM and RS data, selecting the most synchronized neighboring recording sites identifies spatially localized PS clusters that follow the topographic organization of the visual cortex. However, in activity obtained during VFM, PS is spatially more extensive than in RS activity, likely reflecting stimulus-driven interactions between local responses. Nevertheless, the similarity of the PS clusters obtained for RS and stimulus-driven fMRI suggest that they share a common neuroanatomical origin. Our finding justifies and facilitates direct comparison of RS and stimulus-evoked activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Time-varying spectral power of resting-state fMRI networks reveal cross-frequency dependence in dynamic connectivity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; PHASE; EEG; SYNCHRONY; COHERENCE; MEMORY	Brain oscillations and synchronicity among brain regions (brain connectivity) have been studied in resting-state (RS) and task-induced settings. RS-connectivity which captures brain functional integration during an unconstrained state is shown to vary with the frequency of oscillations. Indeed, high temporal resolution modalities have demonstrated both between and cross-frequency connectivity spanning across frequency bands such as theta and gamma. Despite high spatial resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suffers from low temporal resolution due to modulation with slow-varying hemodynamic response function (HRF) and also relatively low sampling rate. This limits the range of detectable frequency bands in fMRI and consequently there has been no evidence of cross frequency dependence in fMRI data. In the present work we uncover recurring patterns of spectral power in network timecourses which provides new insight on the actual nature of frequency variation in fMRI network activations. Moreover, we introduce a new measure of dependence between pairs of rs-fMRI networks which reveals significant cross-frequency dependence between functional brain networks specifically default-mode, cerebellar and visual networks. This is the first strong evidence of cross-frequency dependence between functional networks in fMRI and our subject group analysis based on age and gender supports usefulness of this observation for future clinical applications.

Methods A total of 42 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy were enrolled. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of visually assessed RS-fMRI, MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), video electroencephalography (VEEG), and positron-emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) in EZ localization were evaluated to assess their diagnostic abilities. ReHo, ALFF, and fALFF were also compared for their diagnostic values. Results RS-fMRI showed comparable sensitivity to PET (83.3%) and specificity to VEEG (66.7%), respectively, for EZ localization in patients with focal epilepsy. There were no significant differences between RS-fMRI and the other localization techniques in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. The sensitivities of ReHo, ALFF, and fALFF were 69.4%, 52.8%, and 38.9%, respectively, and for specificities of 66.7%, 83.3%, and 66.7%, respectively. There were no significant differences among ReHo, ALFF, and fALFF, except that ReHo was more sensitive than fALFF. Conclusions RS-fMRI may be an efficient tool for detecting EZs in focal epilepsy patients.

Resting-state network mapping in neurosurgical practice: a review	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Review						resting state; functional connectivity; functional mapping; fMRI	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RESECTION; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; EXTENT; LOCALIZATION; ARCHITECTURE	Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a well-established method for studying intrinsic connectivity and mapping the topography of functional networks in the human brain. In the clinical setting, rs-fMRI has been used to define functional topography, typically language and motor systems, in the context of preoperative planning for neurosurgery. Intraoperative mapping of critical speech and motor areas with electrocortical stimulation (ECS) remains standard practice, but preoperative noninvasive mapping has the potential to reduce operative time and provide functional localization when awake mapping is not feasible. Task-based fMRI has historically been used for this purpose, but it can be limited by the young age of the patient, cognitive impairment, poor cooperation, and need for sedation. Resting-state fMRI allows reliable analysis of all functional networks with a single study and is inherently independent of factors affecting task performance. In this review, the authors provide a summary of the theory and methods for resting-state network mapping. They provide case examples illustrating clinical implementation and discuss limitations of rs-fMRI and review available data regarding performance in comparison to ECS. Finally, they discuss novel opportunities for future clinical applications and prospects for rs-fMRI beyond mapping of regions to avoid during surgery but, instead, as a tool to guide novel network-based therapies.

The current paper presents a new framework on EEG-fMRI data using symmetric data fusion based on Dempster Shafer theory. Basically, symmetric methods require the use of a common theoretical model to explore Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data jointly. Dempster Shafer theory has a multivariate use in resolving problems related to uncertainty. Accordingly, Basic Belief Assignment and the combination rule offered by such theory allow fusing multimodel sources such EEG (temporal modality) and fMRI (spatial modality). In particular, mass functions for each modality have been calculated. Then, the combination rule has been computed. Finally, this measure has been used to detect the activated areas in the brain via clustering using the potential-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. Both real auditory and artificial data simulation have been employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Also, true, false activation rates and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC curve) have been used to establish a comparison with jointICA method. The obtained results have clearly shown the ability of the introduced approach to outperform a standard method of data analysis to reveal a better activation map.

Even further, DL models often act as black boxes, impeding insight into the association of cognitive state and brain activity. To approach these challenges, we introduce the DeepLight framework, which utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based DL models to analyze whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. To decode a cognitive state (e.g., seeing the image of a house), DeepLight separates an fMRI volume into a sequence of axial brain slices, which is then sequentially processed by an LSTM. To maintain interpretability, DeepLight adapts the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique. Thereby, decomposing its decoding decision into the contributions of the single input voxels to this decision. Importantly, the decomposition is performed on the level of single fMRI volumes, enabling DeepLight to study the associations between cognitive state and brain activity on several levels of data granularity, from the level of the group down to the level of single time points. To demonstrate the versatility of DeepLight, we apply it to a large fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that DeepLight outperforms conventional approaches of uni- and multivariate fMRI analysis in decoding the cognitive states and in identifying the physiologically appropriate brain regions associated with these states. We further demonstrate DeepLight's ability to study the fine-grained temporo-spatial variability of brain activity over sequences of single fMRI samples.

However, interpreting differences in BOLD fMRI based on underlying neuronal activity remains a challenge. Concurrent rsMRI data collection and electrophysiological recording in combination with microiontophoretically injected modulatory chemicals allows for improved understanding of the relationship between resting state BOLD and neuronal activity. New Methods: Simultaneous fMRI, multi-channel intracortical electrophysiology and focal pharmacological manipulation data to be acquired longitudinally in rats for up to 2 months. Our artifact replacing technique is optimized for combined LFP and rsMRI data collection. Results: Intracortical implantation of a multichannel microelectrode array resulted in minimal distortion and signal loss in fMRI images inside a 9.4T MRI scanner. rsMRI-induced electrophysiology artifacts were replaced using an in-house developed algorithm. Microinjection of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) enhanced dopaminergic neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and altered LFP signal and fMRI functional connectivity in the striatum. Comparisons with Existing Method(s): Nanomanufacturing advances permit the production of MRI-compatible microelectrode arrays (with 16 or more channels), extending research beyond conventional methods limited to fewer channels. Our method permits longitudinal data collection of LFP and rsMRI and our algorithm effectively detects and replaces fMRI-induced electrophysiological noise, permitting rsMRI data collection concomitant with LFP recordings. Conclusions: Our model consists of longitudinal concurrent fMRI and multichannel intracortical electrophysiological recording during microinjection of pharmacological agents to modulate neural activity in the rat brain. We used commercial micro-electrodes and recording system and can be readily generalized to other labs.

Evaluation of SLIce Dithered Enhanced Resolution Simultaneous MultiSlice (SLIDER-SMS) for human fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						3T; 7T; High-resolution; fMRI; SLIDER; Super resolution	OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SPIN-ECHO; 7 TESLA; VISUAL-CORTEX; GRADIENT-ECHO; SUPERRESOLUTION; BOLD; ACQUISITION	High isotropic resolution fMRI is challenging primarily due to long repetition times (TR) and insufficient SNR, especially at lower field strengths. Recently, Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS) imaging with blipped-CAIPI has substantially reduced scan time and improved SNR efficiency of fMRI. Similarly, super-resolution techniques utilizing sub-voxel spatial shifts in the slice direction have increased both resolution and SNR efficiency. Here we demonstrate the synergistic combination of SLIce Dithered Enhanced Resolution (SLIDER) and SMS for high-resolution, high-SNR whole brain fMRI in comparison to standard resolution fMRI data as well as high-resolution data. With SLIDER-SMS, high spatial frequency information is recovered (unaliased) even in absence of super-resolution deblurring algorithms. Additionally we find that BOLD CNR (as measured by t-value in a visual checkerboard paradigm) is improved by as much as 100% relative to traditionally acquired high-resolution data. Using this gain in CNR, we are able to obtain unprecedented nominally isotropic resolutions at 3 T (0.66 mm) and 7 T (0.45 mm).

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is considered as the most reliable and accurate technique to decode the human brain activity, on the other hand electroencephalography (EEG) is a portable and low cost solution in brain research. The purpose of this study is to find whether EEG can be used to decode the brain activity patterns like fMRI. In fMRI, data from a very specific brain region is enough to decode the brain activity patterns due to the quality of data. On the other hand, EEG can measure the rapid changes in neuronal activity patterns due to its higher temporal resolution i.e., in msec. These rapid changes mostly occur in different brain regions. In this study, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is used both for EEG and fMRI data analysis and the information is extracted from distributed activation patterns of the brain. The significant information among different classes is extracted using two sample t test in both data sets. Finally, the classification analysis is done using the support vector machine. A fair comparison of both data sets is done using the same analysis techniques, moreover simultaneously collected data of EEG and fMRI is used for this comparison. The final analysis is done with the data of eight participants; the average result of all conditions are found which is 65.7% for EEG data set and 64.1% for fMRI data set. It concludes that EEG is capable of doing brain decoding with the data from multiple brain regions. In other words, decoding accuracy with EEG MVPA is as good as fMRI MVPA and is above chance level.

Since the fMRI phase image (unwrapped) provides a representation of brain internal magnetic fieldmap (by a constant scale difference), it can also be used to study brain function while providing a more direct representation of the brain's magnetic state. In this study, we collected a cohort of resting-state fMRI magnitude and phase data pairs from 600 subjects (age from 10 to 76, 346 males), decomposed the phase data by group independent component analysis (pICA), calculated the functional network connectivity (pFNC). In comparison with the magnitude-based brain function analysis (mICA and mFNC), we find that the pFNC matrix contains fewer significant functional connections (with p-value thresholding) than the mFNC matrix, which are sparsely distributed across the whole brain with near/far interconnections and positive/negative correlations in rough balance. We also find a few of brain rest sub-networks within the phase data, primarily in subcortical, cerebellar, and visual regions. Overall, our findings offer new insights into brain function connectivity in the context of a focus on the brain's internal magnetic state.

Additionally, various sources of artifact inherent in fMRI data can have detrimental impact on effect size estimates and statistical power. Here we show how specific removal of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Without smoothing, group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24% in regions canonically associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts (40-149%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. Effect size boosting occurs via reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level and consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level. Smoothing can attenuate ME-ICA-related effect size improvements in certain circumstances. Power simulations demonstrate that ME-ICA-related effect size enhancements enable much higher-powered studies at traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could mitigate some issues regarding statistical power in fMRI studies and enable novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are currently under-appreciated and not well understood.

In this study, we measured the laminar spread of the CBVw fMRI evoked response in the external plexiform layer (EPL, 265 +/- 65 mu m anatomical thickness, mean +/- SD, n = 30 locations from 5 rats) of the rat olfactory bulb during electrical stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract and examined its potential vascular source. First, we obtained the evoked CBVw fMRI responses with a 55 x 55 mu m(2) in-plane resolution and a 500-mu m thickness at 9.4 T, and found that the fMRI signal peaked predominantly in the inner half of EPL (136 +/- 54 mu m anatomical thickness). The mean full-width at half-maximum of these fMRI peaks was 347 +/- 102 mu m and the functional spread was approximately 100 or 200 mu m when the effects of the laminar thicknesses of EPL or inner EPL were removed, respectively. Second, we visualized the vascular architecture of EPL from a different rat using a Clear Lipid-exchanged Anatomically Rigid Imaging/immunostaining-compatible Tissue hYdrogel (CLARITY)-based tissue preparation method and confocal microscopy. Microvascular segments with an outer diameter of <11 mu m accounted for 64.3% of the total vascular volume within EPL and had a mean segment length of 55 +/- 40 mu m (n = 472). Additionally, vessels that crossed the EPL border had a mean segment length outside of EPL equal to 73 +/- 61 mu m (n = 28), which is comparable to half of the functional spread (50-100 mu m). Therefore, we conclude that dilation of these microvessels, including capillaries, likely dominate the CBVw fMRI response and that the biological limit of the fMRI spatial resolution is approximately the average length of 1-2 microvessel segments, which may be sufficient for examining sublaminar circuits.

However, the relationship between thalamocortical FC and cognitive impairment has not been thoroughly investigated. We hypothesized that aberrant thalamocortical FC is related to attention deficits in schizophrenia. Thirty-eight patients with schizophrenia and 38 matched healthy controls underwent rs-fMRI and task fMRI while performing a Flanker task. We observed decreased left thalamic activation in patients with schizophrenia using task fMRI to determine the thalamic seed. A seed-based analysis using this seed was performed in the whole brain to assess differences in thalamocortical FC between the groups. Significantly worse performance was observed in the patient group. The rs-fMRI analysis revealed significantly increased FC between the left thalamus seed and the occipital cortices/postcentral gyri in patients when compared to controls. In the patient group, significant positive correlations were observed between the degree of FC from the left thalamus to the bilateral occipital gyri, which correspond to the visual cortex, and the Flanker effect. No significant correlation was detected in the control group. These results indicate that aberrant FC between the left thalamus and the visual cortex is related to attention deficits in schizophrenia.

This information is critical for understanding how the nature of pain is represented in the primate brain. Using a combination of submillimeter-resolution fMRI and microelectrode local field potential (LFP) and spike recordings, we identified spatially segregated cortical zones for processing touch and nociceptive heat and cold stimuli in somatotopically appropriate areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 of S1 in male monkeys. The distances between zones were comparable (similar to 3.4 mm) across stimulus modalities (heat, cold, and tactile), indicating the existence of uniform, modality-specific modules. Stimulus-evoked LFP maps validated the fMRI maps in areas 3b and 1. Isolation of heat and cold nociceptive neurons from the fMRI zones confirmed the validity of using fMRI to probe nociceptive regions and circuits. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed distinct intrinsic functional circuits among functionally related zones. We discovered distinct modular structures and networks for thermal nociception within S1 cortex, a finding that has significant implications for studying chronic pain syndromes and guiding the selection of neuro-modulation targets for chronic pain management.

This study investigated habituation to fearful faces and houses in ASD and whether fMRI measures of brain activity discriminate between ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. Two identical fMRI runs presenting masked fearful faces, houses, and scrambled images were collected. We found significantly slower fMRI responses to fearful faces but not houses in ASD. In addition, the pattern of slow to emerge amygdala activation to faces had robust discriminability [ASD vs. TD; area under the curve (AUC) = .852, p < .001]. In contrast, habituation to houses had no predictive value (AUC = .573, p = .365). Amygdala habituation to emotional faces may be useful for quantifying risk in ASD.

Although studies have reported that various neuropsychiatric disorders exhibit abnormalities in R-fMRI measures, these "biomarkers" have not been validated in differentiating structural lesions (brain tumors) as a concept proof. We enrolled 60 patients with intracranial tumors located in the unilateral cranial cavity and 60 matched normal controls to test whether R-fMRI indices can differentiate tumors, which represents a prerequisite for adapting such indices as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. Common R-fMRI indices of tumors and their counterpart control regions, which were defined as the contralateral normal areas (for amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC)) and ipsilateral regions surrounding the tumors (for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC)), were comprehensively assessed. According to robust paired t-tests with a Bonferroni correction, only VMHC (Fisher's r-to-z transformed) could successfully differentiate substantial tumors from their counterpart normal regions in patients. Furthermore, ALFF and DC were not able to differentiate tumor from normal unless Z-standardization was employed. To validate the lower power of the between-subject design compared to the within-subject design, each metric was calculated in a matched control group, and robust two-sample t-tests were used to compare the patient tumors and the normal controls at the same place. Similarly, only VMHC succeeded in differentiating significant differences between tumors and the sham tumor areas of normal controls. This study tested the premise of R-fMRI biomarkers for differentiating lesions, and brings a new understanding to physical significance of the Z-standardization.

However, linear dimensionality analysis techniques may fail to capture the nonlinearity of brain neuroactivity. Moreover, besides resting-state FC, the FC based on task fMRI can be expected to provide complementary information. Motivated by these considerations, we nonlinearly fuse restingstate and task-based FC networks (FCNs) to seek a better representation in this paper. Methods: We propose a framework based on alternating diffusion map (ADM), which extracts geometry-preserving low-dimensional embeddings that successfully parameterize the intrinsic variables driving the phenomenon of interest. Specifically, we first separately build resting-state and task-based FCNs by symmetric positive definite matrices using sparse inverse covariance estimation for each subject, and then utilize the ADM to fuse them in order to extract significant low-dimensional embeddings, which are used as fingerprints to identify individuals. Results: The proposed framework is validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort data, where we conduct extensive experimental study on resting-state and fractal n-back task fMRI for the classification of intelligence quotient (IQ). The fusion of resting-state and n-back task fMRI by the proposed framework achieves better classification accuracy than any single fMRI, and the proposed framework is shown to outperform several other data fusion methods. Conclusion and Significance: To our knowledge, this paper is the first to demonstrate a successful extension of the ADM to fuse resting-state and task-based fMRI data for accurate prediction of IQ.

Although either temporal or spatial prior information has been introduced into the constrained ICA and semi-blind ICA methods to improve the performance of ICA in fMRI data analysis, certain types of additional prior information, such as the sparsity, has seldom been added to the ICA algorithms as constraints. New method: In this study, we proposed a SparseFastlCA method by adding the source sparsity as a constraint to the FastICA algorithm to improve the performance of the widely used FastICA. The source sparsity is estimated through a smoothed l(0) norm method. We performed experimental tests on both simulated data and real fMRI data to investigate the feasibility and robustness of SparseFastlCA and made a performance comparison between SparseFastlCA, FastICA and Infomax ICA. Results: Results of the simulated and real fMRI data demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of SparseFastlCA for the source separation in fMRI data. Comparison with existing methods: Both the simulated and real fMRI experimental results showed that SparseFastlCA has better robustness to noise and better spatial detection power than FastICA. Although the spatial detection power of SparseFastlCA and Infomax did not show significant difference, SparseFastlCA had faster computation speed than Infomax. Conclusions: SparseFastlCA was comparable to the Infomax algorithm with a faster computation speed. More importantly, SparseFastlCA outperformed FastICA in robustness and spatial detection power and can be used to identify more accurate brain networks than FastICA algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We combined fMRI with a novel robotic device (MR-compatible hand-induced robotic device [MR_CHIROD]) so that a person in the scanner can execute a controlled motor task, hand-squeezing, which is a very important hand movement to study in neurological motor disease. We employed parallel imaging (generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions [GRAPPA]), which allowed higher spatial resolution resulting in increased sensitivity to BOLD. The combination of fMRI with the hand-induced robotic device allowed precise control and monitoring of the task that was executed while a participant was in the scanner; this may prove to be of utility in rehabilitation of hand motor function in patients recovering from neurological deficits (e.g., stroke). Here we outline the protocol for using the current prototype of the MR_CHIROD during an fMRI scan.

J	Koopmans, PJ; Yacoub, E				Koopmans, Peter J.; Yacoub, Essa			Strategies and prospects for cortical depth dependent T2 and T2*weighted BOLD fMRI studies	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review							SPIN-ECHO BOLD; HIGH-RESOLUTION; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; LAMINAR SPECIFICITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; WHOLE-BRAIN; BLOOD; ACTIVATION	Technological advancements in fMRI have afforded the opportunity to conduct submillimeter investigations into human brain function. The ability to do cortical depth dependent (or layer-specific) fMRI could allow probing intrinsic neuronal organizations and inter-connections, including the directionality of interregional information flow, while ultimately shedding light on uniquely human behaviors. The methodological development and applications of cortical depth dependent fMRI has been ongoing for nearly a decade, yet a consensus on protocols, analysis pipelines and interpretations of data has yet to be reached. In this article we discuss the current status and understandings of high resolution fMRI data and methods. In particular, the spatial signal characteristics of the BOLD contrast are examined in relation to the intra-cortical vasculature and associated underlying contrast mechanisms for three pulse sequences used in laminar fMRI: gradient echo (GE), spin echo (SE) and 3D-GRASE. We conclude with a short overview of factors to be taken into account when designing a specific study, including the choice of pulse sequence, experimental design, and data analysis strategy.

J	Huang, J				Huang, Jie			Human brain functional areas of unitary pooled activity discovered with fMRI	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; VISUAL AREAS; MRI; CORTEX	We report the discovery of human brain functional areas of unitary pooled activity (FAUPAs) using fMRI. A FAUPA is defined as an area in which the temporal variation of the activity is the same across the entire area. This dynamically unitary activity implies a perfect temporal correlation everywhere within the FAUPA for the activity-induced BOLD response, i.e., the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient (R) is 1 for the BOLD responses of any two locations within the FAUPA. A novel method was developed to identify the FAUPA. In this study, nine subjects had a resting-state (rs) fMRI and a task-fMRI. FAUPAs have been identified for both rs- and task-fMRI, and their determination was objective and automatic, with no a-priori knowledge. The group mean of R was 0.952 +/- 0.004 for the rs-fMRI and 0.950 +/- 0.002 for the task-fMRI, showing the dynamically unitary activity within each FAUPA. For the finger-tapping (FT) task, the group-mean BOLD signal time course of the FT-associated FAUPAs in the primary motor cortex was almost perfectly correlated with the FT-induced ideal response (R = 0.9330, P = 1.8 x 10(-56)), confirming the association of the FAUPA with the task. A task-associated FAUPA may play the role of a functional unit for a particular neural computation.

Noninvasive functional neuroimaging can, in principle, resolve cortical laminae (layers), and thus provide insight into human neural computations and interregional connections. However human neuroimaging data are noisy and difficult to interpret; biologically realistic simulations can aid experimental interpretation by relating the neuroimaging data to simulated neural activity. We illustrate the potential of laminar neuroimaging by upgrading an existing large-scale, multiregion neural model that simulates a visual delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task. The new laminar-based neural unit incorporates spiny stellate, pyramidal, and inhibitory neural populations which are divided among supragranular, granular, and infragranular laminae (layers). We simulated neural activity which is translated into local field potential-like data used to simulate conventional and laminar fMRI activity. We implemented the laminar connectivity schemes proposed by Felleman and Van Essen (Cerebral Cortex, 1991) for interregional connections. The hemodynamic model that we employ is a modified version of one due to Heinzle et al. (Neuroimage, 2016) that incorporates the effects of draining veins. We show that the laminar version of the model replicates the findings of the existing model. The laminar model shows the finer structure in fMRI activity and functional connectivity. Laminar differences in the magnitude of neural activities are a prominent finding; these are also visible in the simulated fMRI. We illustrate differences between task and control conditions in the fMRI signal, and demonstrate differences in interregional laminar functional connectivity that reflect the underlying connectivity scheme. These results indicate that multi-layer computational models can aid in interpreting layer-specific fMRI, and suggest that increased use of laminar fMRI could provide unique and fundamental insights to human neuroscience.

However, the current fMRI literature lacks a general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel longitudinal FC model using a variance components approach. First, for all subjects' visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared across the population, 2) the baseline FC strength, and 3) the FC's longitudinal trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in fMRI time series data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in the baseline FC network and change in FC over longitudinal time between a set of patients and a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Overall, we found no difference in the global FC network between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, but did find differing local aging patterns in the FC between the left hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex.

The extent and pattern of brain activation can be determined through a version of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with erotic picture stimuli (task fMRI) and a resting-state fMRI (rs fMRI). We showed that the brain activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left insula was decreased both during the task and in the resting state, while there was higher activation in the right middle temporal gyrus during the task. Higher functional connectivity was found in PE between those three brain areas and the bilateral middle cingulate cortex, right middle frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area. Moreover, the brain activity had positive correlation with clinical rating scales, such as intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (CIPE). These findings revealed that brain responses and functional integration in certain brain areas are impaired in cases of PE, which was consistently supported by multiple measurements obtained using a task and rs fMRI approach.

Reliability of Task-Based fMRI for Preoperative Planning: A Test-Retest Study in Brain Tumor Patients and Healthy Controls	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AWAKE CRANIOTOMY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; BOLD FMRI; REPRODUCIBILITY; ACTIVATION; LOCALIZATION; VARIABILITY; MOTION	Background Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) continues to develop as a clinical tool for patients with brain cancer, offering data that may directly influence surgical decisions. Unfortunately, routine integration of preoperative fMRI has been limited by concerns about reliability. Many pertinent studies have been undertaken involving healthy controls, but work involving brain tumor patients has been limited. To develop fMRI fully as a clinical tool, it will be critical to examine these reliability issues among patients with brain tumors. The present work is the first to extensively characterize differences in activation map quality between brain tumor patients and healthy controls, including the effects of tumor grade and the chosen behavioral testing paradigm on reliability outcomes. Method Test-retest data were collected for a group of low-grade (n = 6) and high-grade glioma (n = 6) patients, and for matched healthy controls (n = 12), who performed motor and language tasks during a single fMRI session. Reliability was characterized by the spatial overlap and displacement of brain activity clusters, BOLD signal stability, and the laterality index. Significance testing was performed to assess differences in reliability between the patients and controls, and low-grade and high-grade patients; as well as between different fMRI testing paradigms. Results There were few significant differences in fMRI reliability measures between patients and controls. Reliability was significantly lower when comparing high-grade tumor patients to controls, or to low-grade tumor patients. The motor task produced more reliable activation patterns than the language tasks, as did the rhyming task in comparison to the phonemic fluency task. Conclusion In low-grade glioma patients, fMRI data are as reliable as healthy control subjects. For high-grade glioma patients, further investigation is required to determine the underlying causes of reduced reliability. To maximize reliability outcomes, testing paradigms should be carefully selected to generate robust activation patterns.

Combined full-band electroencephalography-fMRI (fbEEG-fMRI) studies have shown that infraslow (<.1 Hz) fluctuations in EEG scalp potential are correlated with the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals and that also this correlation appears variable over time. Here, we used simultaneous fbEEG-fMRI to test the hypothesis that correlation dynamics between BOLD and fbEEG signals could be explained by fluctuations in the activation properties of resting-state networks (RSNs) such as the extent or strength of their activation. We used ultrafast magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG) fMRI to enable temporally accurate and statistically robust short-time-window comparisons of infra-slow fbEEG and BOLD signals. We found that the temporal fluctuations in the fbEEG-BOLD correlation were dependent on RSN connectivity strength, but not on the mean signal level or magnitude of RSN activation or motion during scanning. Moreover, the EEG-fMRI correlations were strongest when the intrinsic RSN connectivity was strong and close to the pial surface. Conversely, weak fbEEG-BOLD correlations were attributable to periods of less coherent or spatially more scattered intrinsic RSN connectivity, or RSN activation in deeper cerebral structures. The results thus show that the on-average low correlations between infra-slow EEG and BOLD signals are, in fact, governed by the momentary coherence and depth of the underlying RSN activation, and may reach systematically high values with appropriate source activities. These findings further consolidate the notion of slow scalp potentials being directly coupled to hemodynamic fluctuations.

While these effects have become better understood in recent years, the impact that their correction has on the quality of rs-fMRI measurements has yet to be clarified. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of correcting for CRV, RVT and PETCO2 on the rs-fMRI measurements. Nine healthy subjects underwent a test-retest rs-fMRI acquisition using repetition times (TRs) of 2 s (long-TR) and 0.323 s (short-TR), and the data were processed using eight different physiological correction strategies. Subsequently, regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and resting-state connectivity of the motor and default-mode networks are calculated for each strategy. Reproducibility is calculated using intra-class correlation and the Dice Coefficient, while the accuracy of functional-connectivity measures is assessed through network separability, sensitivity and specificity. We found that: (1) the reproducibility of the rs-fMRI measures improved significantly after correction for PETCO2; (2) separability of functional networks increased after PETCO2 correction but was not affected by RVT and CRV correction; (3) the effect of physiological correction does not depend on the data sampling-rate; (4) the effect of physiological processes and correction strategies is network-specific. Our findings highlight limitations in our understanding of rs-fMRI quality measures, and underscore the importance of using multiple quality measures to determine the optimal physiological correction strategy.

Low-frequency hippocampal-cortical activity drives brain-wide resting-state functional MRI connectivity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						hippocampus; resting-state functional connectivity; optogenetic; fMRI; low frequency	SLOW OSCILLATIONS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; THETA RHYTHM; FMRI; MEMORY; NETWORK; CORTEX; ANESTHESIA; RIPPLES	The hippocampus, including the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), and cortex engage in bidirectional communication. We propose that low-frequency activity in hippocampal-cortical pathways contributes to brain-wide resting-state connectivity to integrate sensory information. Using optogenetic stimulation and brain-wide fMRI and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), we determined the large-scale effects of spatiotemporal-specific downstream propagation of hippocampal activity. Low-frequency (1 Hz), but not high-frequency (40 Hz), stimulation of dDG excitatory neurons evoked robust cortical and subcortical brain-wide fMRI responses. More importantly, it enhanced interhemispheric rsfMRI connectivity in various cortices and hippocampus. Subsequent local field potential recordings revealed an increase in slow oscillations in dorsal hippocampus and visual cortex, interhemispheric visual cortical connectivity, and hippocampal-cortical connectivity. Meanwhile, pharmacological inactivation of dDG neurons decreased interhemispheric rsfMRI connectivity. Functionally, visually evoked fMRI responses in visual regions also increased during and after low-frequency dDG stimulation. Together, our results indicate that low-frequency activity robustly propagates in the dorsal hippocampal-cortical pathway, drives interhemispheric cortical rsfMRI connectivity, and mediates visual processing.

Task-evoked Negative BOLD Response and Functional Connectivity in the Default Mode Network are Representative of Two Overlapping but Separate Neurophysiological Processes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BLOOD-FLOW; BRAIN; FMRI; CONNECTOME; DEACTIVATION; FLUCTUATIONS; ABNORMALITIES; OSCILLATIONS; ARCHITECTURE	The topography of the default mode network (DMN) can be obtained with one of two different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods: either from the spontaneous but organized synchrony of the low-frequency fluctuations in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), known as "functional connectivity", or from the consistent and robust deactivations in task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI), here referred to as the "negative BOLD response" (NBR). These two methods are fundamentally different, but their results are often used interchangeably to describe the brain's resting-state, baseline, or intrinsic activity. While the DMN was initially defined by consistent task-based decreases in blood flow in a set of specific brain regions using PET imaging, recently nearly all studies on the DMN employ functional connectivity in rs-fMRI. In this study, we first show the high level of spatial overlap between NBR and functional connectivity of the DMN extracted from the same tb-fMRI scan; then, we demonstrate that the NBR in putative DMN regions can be significantly altered without causing any change in their overlapping functional connectivity. Furthermore, we present evidence that in the DMN, the NBR is more closely related to task performance than the functional connectivity. We conclude that the NBR and functional connectivity of the DMN reflect two separate but overlapping neurophysiological processes, and thus should be differentiated in studies investigating brain-behavior relationships in both healthy and diseased populations. Our findings further raise the possibility that the macro-scale networks of the human brain might internally exhibit a hierarchical functional architecture.

However, its inevitable confounding with hemodynamic responses outside the brain, especially in the frontotemporal head, has questioned its validity. Some researchers attempted to validate NIRS signals through concurrent measurements with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but, counterintuitively, NIRS signals rarely correlate with local fMRI signals in NIRS channels, although both mapping techniques should measure the same hemoglobin concentration. Here, we tested a novel hypothesis that different voxels within the scalp and the brain tissues might have substantially different hemoglobin absorption rates of near-infrared light, which might differentially contribute to NIRS signals across channels. Therefore, we newly applied a multivariate approach, a partial least squares regression, to explain NIRS signals with multivoxel information from fMRI within the brain and soft tissues in the head. We concurrently obtained fMRI and NIRS signals in 9 healthy human subjects engaging in an n-back task. The multivariate fMRI model was quite successfully able to predict the NIRS signals by cross-validation (interclass correlation coefficient = similar to 0.85). This result confirmed that fMRI and NIRS surely measure the same hemoglobin concentration. Additional application of Monte-Carlo permutation tests confirmed that the model surely reflects temporal and spatial hemodynamic information, not random noise. After this thorough validation, we calculated the ratios of the contributions of the brain and soft-tissue hemodynamics to the NIRS signals, and found that the contribution ratios were quite different across different NIRS channels in reality, presumably because of the structural complexity of the frontotemporal regions.

Data was collected while participants viewed six chocolate bar communications and product pictures before and after each communication. Then self-reports liking judgement were collected. fMRI data was extracted from a priori selected brain regions: nucleus accumbens, medial orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex assumed to contribute positively and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and insula were hypothesized to contribute negatively to sales. The resulting values were rank ordered. After our fMRI-based forecast an instore test was conducted in a supermarket on n=63.617 shoppers. Changes in sales were best forecasted by fMRI signal during communication viewing, second best by a comparison of brain signal during product viewing before and after communication and least by explicit liking judgements. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying neuroimaging methods in a relatively small sample to correctly forecast sales changes at point-of-sale. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a novel space affine matching feature is presented by introducing the time domain and frequency domain features. The time domain feature is used to discern different stimuli, while the frequency domain feature to eliminate the delay. And then we propose a space affine matching (SAM) algorithm to match fMRI time series by our affine feature, in which a normal vector is estimated using gradient descent to explore the time series matching optimally. The experimental results illustrate that the SAM algorithm is insensitive to the delay between the hemodynamic response signal and the cognitive stimuli signal. Our approach significantly outperforms GLM method while there exists the delay. The approach can help us solve the SFDP problem in fMRI time series matching and thus of great promise to reveal brain dynamics.

A full understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration still eludes medical researchers, fuelling the development of in vivo neuroimaging markers. Hence it is increasingly recognized that our understanding of neurodegenerative processes likely will depend upon the available information provided by imaging techniques. At the same time, the imaging techniques are often developed in response to the desire to observe certain physiological processes. In this context, functional MRI (fMRI), which has for decades provided information on neuronal activity, has evolved into a large family of techniques well suited for in vivo observations of brain physiology. Given the rapid technical advances in fMRI in recent years, this review aims to summarize the physiological basis of fMRI observations in healthy aging as well as in age-related neurodegeneration. This review focuses on in-vivo human brain imaging studies in this review and on disease features that can be imaged using fMRI methods. In addition to providing detailed literature summaries, this review also discusses future directions in the study of brain physiology using fMRI in the clinical setting.	[Chen, J.

However, it remains unclear as to whether the brain's functional changes during the resting state are sensitive to the same brain regions during task fMRI. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search of task and resting-state fMRI studies that investigated brain pathological changes in first-episode schizophrenia (Fleischhacker et al.). Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria; seven were resting state fMRI studies with 371 FES patients and 363 healthy controls and twelve were task fMRI studies with 235 FES patients and 291 healthy controls. We found overlapping task and resting-state fMRI abnormalities in the prefrontal regions, including the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the orbital frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, especially in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). The findings of this systematic review support the frontotemporal hypothesis of schizophrenia, and the disruption in prefrontal and STG might represent the pathophysiology of schizophrenia disorder at a relatively early stage.

Evaluation of multi-echo ICA denoising for task based fMRI studies: Block designs, rapid event-related designs, and cardiac-gated fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi-echo fMRI; ME-ICA; Rapid event related; Block design; Sensitivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BOLD-CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; REMOVING MOTION ARTIFACTS; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; BRAIN; EPI; REDUCTION; SIGNAL; ENHANCEMENT; ACTIVATION	Multi-echo fMRI, particularly the multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA) algorithm, has previously proven useful for increasing the sensitivity and reducing false positives for functional MRI (fMRI) based resting state connectivity studies. Less is known about its efficacy for task-based fMRI, especially at the single subject level. This work, which focuses exclusively on individual subject results, compares ME-ICA to single-echo fMRI and a voxel-wise T-2*. weighted combination of multi-echo data for task-based fMRI under the following scenarios: cardiac-gated block designs, constant repetition time (TR) block designs, and constant TR rapid event-related designs. Performance is evaluated primarily in terms of sensitivity (i.e., activation extent, activation magnitude, percent detected trials and effect size estimates) using five different tasks expected to evoke neuronal activity in a distributed set of regions. The ME-ICA algorithm significantly outperformed all other evaluated processing alternatives in all scenarios. Largest improvements were observed for the cardiac-gated dataset, where ME-ICA was able to reliably detect and remove non-neural T-1 signal fluctuations caused by non-constant repetition times. Although ME-ICA also outperformed the other options in terms of percent detection of individual trials for rapid event-related experiments, only 46% of all events were detected after ME-ICA; suggesting additional improvements in sensitivity are required to reliably detect individual short event occurrences. We conclude the manuscript with a detailed evaluation of ME-ICA outcomes and a discussion of how the ME-ICA algorithm could be further improved. Overall, our results suggest that ME-ICA constitutes a versatile, powerful approach for advanced denoising of task-based fMRI, not just resting-state data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Popular group-level analysis in fMRI is based on the general linear model and constitutes a univariate method. However, univariate methods are known to suffer from low sensitivity for a given specificity because the spatial covariance structure at each voxel is not taken entirely into account. In this study, a spatially constrained local multivariate model is introduced for group-level analysis to improve sensitivity at a given specificity for activation detection. The proposed model is formulated in terms of a multivariate constrained optimization problem based on the maximum log likelihood method and solved efficiently with numerical optimization techniques. Both simulated data mimicking real fMRI time series at multiple noise fractions and real fMRI episodic memory data have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. For simulated data, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves in detecting group activations increases for the subject and group level multivariate method by 20%, as compared to the univariate method. Results from real fMRI data indicate a significant increase in group-level activation detection, particularly in hippocampus, para-hippocampal area and nearby medial temporal lobe regions with the proposed method.

A Novel Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Paradigm for the Preoperative Assessment of Auditory Perception in a Musician Undergoing Temporal Lobe Surgery	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Epilepsies; Functional MRI; Music; Surgery	LANGUAGE; AREAS; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; EPILEPSY; IMAGERY; FMRI	BACKGROUND: Presurgical evaluation for temporal lobe epilepsy routinely assesses speech and memory lateralization and anatomic localization of the motor and visual areas but not baseline musical processing. This is paramount in a musician. Although validated tools exist to assess musical ability, there are no reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms to assess musical processing. We examined the utility of a novel fMRI paradigm in an 18-year-old left-handed pianist who underwent surgery for a left temporal low-grade ganglioglioma. METHODS: Preoperative evaluation consisted of neuropsychological evaluation, T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and fMRI. Auditory blood oxygen leveledependent fMRI was performed using a dedicated auditory scanning sequence. Three separate auditory investigations were conducted: listening to, humming, and thinking about a musical piece. RESULTS: All auditory fMRI paradigms activated the primary auditory cortex with varying degrees of auditory lateralization. Thinking about the piece additionally activated the primary visual cortices (bilaterally) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Humming demonstrated left-sided predominance of auditory cortex activation with activity observed in close proximity to the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated an fMRI paradigm for evaluating musical processing that could form part of preoperative assessment for patients undergoing temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy.

Transcortical Sensory Aphasia after Left Frontal Lobe Infarction: Loss of Functional Connectivity	EUROPEAN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Functional MRI; Frontal lobe; Transcortical aphasia	COMPREHENSION; LESIONS; STROKE	Background: The underlying mechanism of transcortical sensory aphasia (TSA) caused by lesions occurring in the left frontal lobe remains unclear. We attempted to investigate the mechanism with the use of functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: We studied 2 patients with TSA after a left frontal infarction identified by diffusion-weighted MRI. As control subjects, a patient with transcortical motor aphasia and a healthy normal adult were chosen. The Korean version of Western Aphasia Battery was performed initially and at 3 months post stroke. We performed fMRI using verb generation and sentence completion tasks. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was also obtained for network-level analysis initially and at 3 months post stroke. Results: The results of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI revealed no diffusion-perfusion mismatch. Initial fMRI in patients with TSA showed no reversed inter-/intrahemispheric activation patterns. rs=fMRI showed significantly decreased resting-state functional connectivity in the language network in patients with TSA compared with the control subjects. Follow-up rs-fMRI studies showed improvement in functional connectivity along with the recovery of patients' language function. Conclusion: Our data showed that the auditory comprehension deficits in patients with frontal lobe infarcts is attributed to difficulty accessing the posterior language area due to functional disconnection between language centers in the acute stage of stroke.

However, the advantages of this accelerated acquisition for rs-fMRI have not been evaluated. New method: In this study, we used SMS Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) to probe whole-brain functional connectivity with a short repetition time (TR = 350 ms) and compared it with standard EPI with a longer TR of 2000 ms. We determined the effect of scan length and investigated the temporal filtration strategies that optimize results based on metrics of signal-noise separation and test-retest reliability using both seed-based and independent component analysis (ICA). Results: We found that use of either the entire frequency range of 0.01-1.4 Hz or the entire frequency range with the exclusion of typical cardiac and respiratory frequency values tended to provide the best functional connectivity maps. Comparison with existing methods: We found that the SMS-acquired rs-fMRI scans had improved the signal-noise separation, while preserving the same level of test-retest reliability compared to conventional EPI, and enabled the detection of reliable functional connectivity networks with scan times as short as 3 min. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that whole-brain rs-fMRI studies may benefit from the increased temporal resolution enabled by the SMS-EPI acquisition, leading to drastic scan time reductions, which in turn should enable the more widespread use of rs-fMRI in clinical research protocols.

Frequency and amplitude modulation of resting-state fMRI signals and their functional relevance in normal aging	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Blood oxygen leveledependent signal; Frequency and amplitude; Hilbert-Huang transform; Aging	EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE STATES; BLOOD-FLOW; CONNECTIVITY; FLUCTUATIONS; COMPLEXITY; VARIABILITY; CORTEX	The intrinsic composition and functional relevance of resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent signals are fundamental in research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using the Hilbert-Huang Transform to estimate high-resolution time-frequency spectra, we investigated the instantaneous frequency and amplitude modulation of resting-state fMRI signals, as well as their functional relevance in a large normal-aging cohort (n = 420, age = 21-89 years). We evaluated the cognitive function of each participant and recorded respiratory signals during fMRI scans. The results showed that the Hilbert-Huang Transform effectively categorized resting-state fMRI power spectra into high (0.087 -0.2 Hz), low (0.045-0.087 Hz), and very-low (<= 0.045 Hz) frequency bands. The high-frequency power was associated with respiratory activity, and the low-frequency power was associated with cognitive function. Furthermore, within the cognition-related low-frequency band (0.045-0.087 Hz), we discovered that aging was associated with the increased frequency modulation and reduced amplitude modulation of the resting-state fMRI signal. These aging-related changes in frequency and amplitude modulation of resting-state fMRI signals were unaccounted for by the loss of gray matter volume and were consistently identified in the default mode and salience network. These findings indicate that resting-state fMRI signal modulations are dynamic during the normal aging process. In summary, our results refined the functionally related blood oxygen level-dependent frequency band in a considerably narrow band at a low-frequency range (0.045-0.087 Hz) and challenged the current method of resting-fMRI preprocessing by using low-frequency filters with a relatively wide range below 0.1 Hz.

Prolongation of ERP latency and reaction time (RT) in simultaneous EEG/fMRI data acquisition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG/fMRI; Reaction time; Posterior N100; P300; Electromagnetic effect; Experimental environment	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; STATIC MAGNETIC-FIELDS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACTS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; BLIND SEPARATION; ODDBALL PARADIGM; P300 RECORDINGS; BRAIN	Background: Recording EEG and fMRI data simultaneously inside a fully-operating scanner has been recognized as a novel approach in human brain research. Studies have demonstrated high concordance between the EEG signals and hemodynamic response. However, a few studies reported altered cognitive process inside the fMRI scanner such as delayed reaction time (RT) and reduced and/or delayed N100 and P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) components. New method: The present study investigated the influence of electromagnetic field (static magnetic field, radio frequency (RF) pulse, and gradient switching) and experimental environment on posterior N100 and P300 ERP components in four different settings with six healthy subjects using a visual oddball task: (1) classic fMRI acquisition inside the scanner (e.g., supine position, mirror glasses for stimulus presentation), (2) standard behavioral experiment outside the scanner (e.g., seated position, keyboard response), (3) controlled fMRI acquisition inside the scanner (e.g., organic light-emitting diode (OLED) goggles for stimulus presentation) inside; and (4) modified behavioral experiment outside the scanner (e.g., supine position, OLED goggles). Results: The study findings indicated that the experimental environment in simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition could substantially delay NIP, P300 latency, and RT inside the scanner, and was associated with a reduced N1P amplitude. Comparison with existing methods: There was no effect of electromagnetic field in the prolongation of RT, N1P and P300 latency inside the scanner. NIP, but not P300, latency was sensitive to stimulus presentation method inside the scanner. Conclusion: Future simultaneous EEG/fMRI data collection should consider experimental environment in both design and analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, X; Wu, T; Zhan, ZC; Yao, L; Wen, XT				Wu, Xia; Wu, Tong; Zhan, Zhichao; Yao, Li; Wen, Xiaotong			A real-time method to reduce ballistocardiogram artifacts from EEG during fMRI based on optimal basis sets (OBS)	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Ballistocardiogram artifacts; Real-time optimal basis sets	PULSE ARTIFACT; MR SCANNER; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BCG ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; RECORDINGS; MOTION; ACQUISITION; EXTRACTION	Background: The simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides both high temporal and spatial resolution when measuring brain activity. A real-time analysis during a simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition is essential when studying neurofeedback and conducting effective brain activity monitoring. However, the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts which are induced by heartbeat-related electrode movements in an MRI scanner severely contaminate the EEG signals and hinder a reliable real-time analysis. New method: The optimal basis sets (OBS) method is an effective candidate for removing BCG artifacts in a traditional offline EEG-fMRI analysis, but has yet to be applied to a real-time EEG-fMRI analysis. Here, a novel real-time technique based on OBS method (rtOBS) is proposed to remove BCG artifacts on a moment-to-moment basis. Real-time electrocardiogram R-peak detection procedure and sliding window OBS method were adopted. Results: A series of simulated data was constructed to verify the feasibility of the rtOBS technique. Furthermore, this method was applied to real EEG-fMRI data to remove BCG artifacts. The results of both simulated data and real EEG-fMRI data from eight healthy human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of rtOBS in both the time and frequency domains. Comparison with existing methods: A comparison between rtOBS and real-time averaged artifact subtraction (rtAAS) was conducted. The results suggest the efficacy and advantage of rtOBS in the real-time removal of BCG artifacts. Conclusions: In this study, a novel real-time OBS technique was proposed for the real-time removal of BCG artifacts. The proposed method was tested using simulated data and applied to real simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. The results suggest the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Techniques for blood volume fMRI with VASO: From low-resolution mapping towards sub-millimeter layer-dependent applications	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vascular space occupancy; SS-SI VASO; Cerebral blood volume; Simultaneous multi-slice; 3D-EPI; 7 T MRI; Layer-dependent fMRI	SPACE-OCCUPANCY MRI; GRADIENT-ECHO FMRI; WHOLE-BRAIN; SPIN-ECHO; FUNCTIONAL MRI; LAMINAR DIFFERENCES; BOLD ACTIVATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; 7 TESLA; 1.5 T	Quantitative cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI has the potential to overcome several specific limitations of BOLD fMRI. It provides direct physiological interpretability and promises superior localization specificity in applications of sub-millimeter resolution fMRI applications at ultra-high magnetic fields (7 T and higher). Noninvasive CBV fMRI using VASO (vascular space occupancy), however, is inherently limited with respect to its data acquisition efficiency, restricting its imaging coverage and achievable spatial and temporal resolution. This limitation may be reduced with recent advanced acceleration and reconstruction strategies that allow two-dimensional acceleration, such as in simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) 2D-EPI or 3D-EPI in combination with CAIPIRINHA field-of-view shifting. In this study, we sought to determine the functional sensitivity and specificity of these readout strategies with VASO over a broad range of spatial resolutions; spanning from low spatial resolution (3 mm) whole-cortex to sub-millimeter (0.75 mm) slab-of-cortex (for cortical layer-dependent applications). In the thermal-noise-dominated regime of sub-millimeter resolutions, 3D-EPI-VASO provides higher temporal stability and sensitivity to detect changes in CBV compared to 2D-EPI-VASO. In this regime, 3D-EPI-VASO unveils task activation located in the cortical laminae with little contamination from surface veins, in contrast to the cortical surface weighting of GE-BOLD fMRI. In the physiological-noise-dominated regime of lower resolutions, however, 2D-SMS-VASO shows superior performance compared to 3D-EPI-VASO. Due to its superior sensitivity at a layer-dependent level, 3D-EPI VASO promises to play an important role in future neuroscientific applications of layer-dependent fMRI.

EPI distortion correction for concurrent human brain stimulation and imaging at 3T	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Point spread function; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Echo planar imaging; Metal-induced distortion; Networks	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; POINT-SPREAD FUNCTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TMS-FMRI; AREAL ORGANIZATION; CAUSAL EVIDENCE; CORTICAL AREAS; PARIETAL TMS; CORTEX; RESONANCE	Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be paired with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in concurrent TMS-fMRI experiments. These multimodal experiments enable causal probing of network architecture in the human brain which can complement alternative network mapping approaches. Critically, merely introducing the TMS coil into the scanner environment can sometimes produce substantial magnetic field inhomogeneities and spatial distortions which limit the utility of concurrent TMS-fMRI. Method and results: We assessed the efficacy of point spread function corrected echo planar imaging (PSF-EPI) in correcting for the field inhomogeneities associated with a TMS coil at 3 T. In phantom and brain scans, we quantitatively compared the coil-induced distortion artifacts measured in EPI scans with and without PSF correction. We found that the application of PSF corrections to the EPI data significantly improved signal-to-noise and reduced distortions. In phantom scans with the PSF-EPI sequence, we also characterized the temporal profile of dynamic artifacts associated with TMS delivery and found that image quality remained high as long as the TMS pulse preceded the RF excitation pulses by at least 50 ms. Lastly, we validated the PSF-EPI sequence in human brain scans involving TMS and motor behavior as well as resting state fMRI scans. Conclusions: Our collective results demonstrate the potential benefits of PSF-EPI for concurrent TMS-fMRI when coil-related artifacts are a concern. The ability to collect high quality resting state fMRI data in the same session as the concurrent TMS-fMRI experiment offers a unique opportunity to interrogate network architecture in the human brain.

J	Cardenas, VA; Price, M; Fein, G				Cardenas, Valerie A.; Price, Mathew; Fein, George			EEG coherence related to fMRI resting state synchrony in long-term abstinent alcoholics	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Independent components analysis; Resting state; EEG; fMRI; Networks	DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SUBSTANCE USE; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; ACTIVATION; DRINKERS; GAMMA; CONNECTIVITY	Recent work suggests that faulty co-activation or synchrony of multiple brain regions comprising "networks," or an imbalance between opposing brain networks, is important in alcoholism. Previous studies showed higher fMRI resting state synchrony (RSS) within the executive control (inhibitory control and emotion regulation) networks and lower RSS within the appetitive drive network in long-term (multi-year) abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) vs. non substance abusing controls (NSAC). Our goal was to identify EEG networks that are correlated with the appetitive drive and executive function networks identified with fMRI in our previous alcohol studies. We used parallel ICA for multimodal data fusion for the 20 LTAA and 21 NSAC that had both usable fMRI and 64-channel EEG data. Our major result was that parallel ICA identified a pair of components that significantly separated NSAC from LTAA and were correlated with each other. Examination of the resting-state fMRI seed-correlation map component showed higher bilateral nucleus accumbens seed-correlation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and lower seed-correlation in the thalamus. This single component thus encompassed both the executive control and appetitive drive networks, consistent with our previous work. The correlated EEG coherence component showed mostly higher theta and alpha coherence in LTAA compared to NSAC, and lower gamma coherence in LTAA compared to NSAC. The EEG theta and alpha coherence results suggest enhanced top-down control in LTAA and the gamma coherence results suggest impaired appetitive drive in LTAA. Our results support the notion that fMRI RSS is reflected in spontaneous EEG, even when the EEG and fMRI are not obtained simultaneously.

J	Aggarwal, P; Gupta, A				Aggarwal, Priya; Gupta, Anubha			Double temporal sparsity based accelerated reconstruction of compressively sensed resting-state fMRI	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Accelerated functional MRI; l(1) minimization; Sparse recovery; Compressed sensing; k-t acceleration; Undersampling	HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; K-T BLAST; DYNAMIC MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; SENSING RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHM; ECHO	A number of reconstruction methods have been proposed recently for accelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data collection. However, existing methods suffer with the challenge of greater artifacts at high acceleration factors. This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI collection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed method based on l(1)-l(1) norm constraints, wherein we impose first l(1)-norm sparsity on the voxel time series (temporal data) in the transformed domain and the second l(1)-norm sparsity on the successive difference of the same temporal data. Hence, we name the proposed method as Double Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly evaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data. Results are presented at various acceleration factors. Quantitative analysis in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative analysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs) demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the proposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying fMRI data. Compared to the existing methods, the DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10-12 dB in PSNR with acceleration factors upto 3.5 on resting state fMRI data. Simulation results on real data demonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with accurate detection of RSNs.

Concordance among indices of intrinsic brain function: Insights from inter-individual variation and temporal dynamics	SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Resting-state fMRI; Intrinsic brain activity; Concordance; Temporal dynamics; Inter-individual variation	RESTING-STATE FMRI; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; CONNECTIVITY MRI; HEAD MOTION; BOLD SIGNAL; NETWORKS; FLUCTUATIONS; VARIABILITY	Various resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures have been developed to characterize intrinsic brain activity. While each of these measures has gained a growing presence in the literature, questions remain regarding the common and unique aspects these indices capture. The present work provided a comprehensive examination of inter-individual variation and intra-individual temporal variation for commonly used measures, including fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, network centrality and global signal correlation. Regardless of whether examining intra-individual or inter-individual variation, we found that these definitionally distinct R-fMRI indices tend to exhibit a relatively high degree of covariation, which doesn't exist in phase randomized surrogate data. As a measure of intrinsic brain function, concordance for R-fMRI indices was negatively correlated with age across individuals (i.e., concordance among functional indices decreased with age). To understand the functional significance of concordance, we noted that higher concordance was generally associated with higher strengths of R-fMRI indices, regardless of whether looking through the lens of inter-individual (i.e., high vs. low concordance participants) or intra-individual (i.e., high vs. low concordance states identified via temporal dynamic analyses) differences. We also noted a linear increase in functional concordance together with the R-fMRI indices through the scan, which may suggest a decrease in arousal. The current study demonstrated an enriched picture regarding the relationship among the R-fMRI indices, as well as provided new insights in examining dynamic states within and between individuals.

Multiparametric measurement of cerebral physiology using calibrated fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						BOLD; FMRI; CBF; ASL; Gas; Calibration	OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LEVEL-DEPENDENT MRI; RESTING-STATE FMRI; BLOOD-VOLUME RCBV; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; BASE-LINE; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CARBON-DIOXIDE	The ultimate goal of calibrated fMRI is the quantitative imaging of oxygen metabolism ( CMRO2), and this has been the focus of numerous methods and approaches. However, one underappreciated aspect of this quest is that in the drive to measure CMRO2, many other physiological parameters of interest are often acquired along the way. This can significantly increase the value of the dataset, providing greater information that is clinically relevant, or detail that can disambiguate the cause of signal variations. This can also be somewhat of a double-edged sword: calibrated fMRI experiments combine multiple parameters into a physiological model that requires multiple steps, thereby providing more opportunity for error propagation and increasing the noise and error of the final derived values. As with all measurements, there is a trade-off between imaging time, spatial resolution, coverage, and accuracy. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the benefits and pitfalls of extracting multiparametric measurements of cerebral physiology through calibrated fMRI experiments.

METHODS Twelve patients underwent intraoperative MRI-guided resection of lesions in or directly adjacent to the central region and/or pyramidal tract. Intraoperative RS (iRS)-fMRI was performed pre- and intraoperatively and was correlated with patients' postoperative clinical condition, as well as with intraoperative monitoring results. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to postprocess the RS-fMRI data concerning the sensorimotor networks, and the mean z-scores were statistically analyzed. RESULTS iRS-fMRI in anesthetized patients proved to be feasible and analysis revealed no significant differences in preoperative z-scores between the sensorimotor areas ipsi- and contralateral to the tumor. A significant decrease in z-score (p < 0.01) was seen in patients with new neurological deficits postoperatively. The intraoperative z-score in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the tumor had a significant negative correlation with the degree of paresis immediately after the operation (r = -0.67, p < 0.001) and on the day of discharge from the hospital (r = -0.65, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated moderate prognostic value of the intraoperative z-score (area under the curve 0.84) for the paresis score at patient discharge. CONCLUSIONS The use of iRS-fMRI with ICA-based postprocessing and functional activity mapping is feasible and the results may correlate with clinical parameters, demonstrating a significant negative correlation between the intensity of the iRS-fMRI signal and the postoperative neurological changes.

Interactions between head motion and coil sensitivity in accelerated fMRI	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Parallel imaging; Head motion; Coils sensitivity maps; Artifact; SENSE; GRAPPA	PARALLEL IMAGING RECONSTRUCTION; BY-SLICE MOTION; GEOMETRIC DISTORTION; OPTICAL TRACKING; 3 T; BRAIN; SENSE; FIELD; MRI; ARTIFACTS	Background: Parallel imaging is widely adopted to accelerate functional MRI (fMRI) data acquisition, through various strategies that involve multi-channel receiver coils. However, the non-uniform spatial sensitivity of multi-channel receiver coils may introduce unwanted artifacts when head motion occurs during the few-minute long fMRI scans. Although prospective correction provides a promising solution for alleviating the head motion artifacts in fMRI, the relative position of the fixed multi-channel receiver coils moves in the moving reference frame, potentially resulting in artifactual signal. New method: We used numerical simulations to investigate this effect on fMRI using two parallel imaging schemes: sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) with acceleration factors 2 and 4, towards characterizing the regime over which parallel imaging fMRI with prospective motion correction will benefit from updating coil sensitivities to reflect relative positional change between the head and the receiver coil. Moreover, six subjects were scanned with acceleration factors 2 and 4 while performing a simple finger-tapping task with and without overt head motion. Results: Updating coil sensitivities showed significant positive impact on standard deviation and activation maps in presence of overt head motion compared to that obtained with no overt head motion. Comparison with existing methods: The parallel imaging fMRI with updated coil sensitivity maps were compared to that with the coil sensitivity maps acquired at the reference position. Conclusions: Head motion in relation to a fixed multi-channel coil can adversely affect the quality of parallel imaging fMRI data; and updating coil sensitivity map can mitigate this effect.

J	Bright, MG; Tench, CR; Murphy, K				Bright, Molly G.; Tench, Christopher R.; Murphy, Kevin			Potential pitfalls when denoising resting state fMRI data using nuisance regression	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state; fMRI; Noise correction; Nuisance regression; Connectivity	DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; TIME-SERIES; MOTION ARTIFACTS; REMOVING MOTION; BOLD SIGNAL; NOISE; AUTOCORRELATIONS; QUANTIFICATION; FLUCTUATIONS	In resting state fMRI, it is necessary to remove signal variance associated with noise sources, leaving cleaned fMRI time-series that more accurately reflect the underlying intrinsic brain fluctuations of interest. This is commonly achieved through nuisance regression, in which the fit is calculated of a noise model of head motion and physiological processes to the fMRI data in a General Linear Model, and the "cleaned" residuals of this fit are used in further analysis. We examine the statistical assumptions and requirements of the General Linear Model, and whether these are met during nuisance regression of resting state fMRI data. Using toy examples and real data we show how pre-whitening, temporal filtering and temporal shifting of regressors impact model fit. Based on our own observations, existing literature, and statistical theory, we make the following recommendations when employing nuisance regression: pre-whitening should be applied to achieve valid statistical inference of the noise model fit parameters; temporal filtering should be incorporated into the noise model to best account for changes in degrees of freedom; temporal shifting of regressors, although merited, should be achieved via optimisation and validation of a single temporal shift. We encourage all readers to make simple, practical changes to their fMRI denoising pipeline, and to regularly assess the appropriateness of the noise model used. By negotiating the potential pitfalls described in this paper, and by clearly reporting the details of nuisance regression in future manuscripts, we hope that the field will achieve more accurate and precise noise models for cleaning the resting state fMRI time-series.

We examined 74 patients [48 men (64.9%); mean +/- standard deviation age of 42.7 +/- 13.6 years (range: 13 to 70 years); 71 right-handed, 2 left-handed, and 1 ambidextrous] with gliomas located near speech areas. All patients underwent the Wada test and fMRI, and 34 patients underwent awake surgery. The "last-and-first" task was administered during fMRI. The Wada test was successful in determining the language-dominant hemisphere in 73 patients (98.6%): left hemisphere in 68 patients (91.9%), right hemisphere in 4 patients (5.4%), and bilateral in 1 patient (1.4%). The dominant hemisphere for right-handed patients (n = 71) was the left hemisphere in 67 patients (94.3%), right hemisphere in 3 patients (4.2%), and undetectable in 1 patient (1.4%). The fMRI was successful in determining the language-dominant hemisphere in 53 patients (71.6%). The results of the Wada test and fMRI were inconsistent in 5 patients (8.6%), of which 3 (5.2%) exhibited dominance in opposite hemispheres. Furthermore, 2 of these 3 cases (2.7%) were contralateral false positive cases, whereby fMRI identified the right-hemisphere as language dominant for right-handed individuals with tumors in the left hemisphere. Based on these findings, we concluded that the Wada test can be skipped if language dominancy can be detected by fMRI.

DTI and fMRI data were acquired longitudinally over 1year in 245 male and 268 female, no-to-low alcohol-consuming adolescents (12-21 years at baseline) from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study. Brain region average signal values were calculated for susceptibility to nonheme iron deposition: pallidum, putamen, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, and substantia nigra. To estimate nonheme iron, the corpus callosum signal (robust to iron effects) was divided by regional signals to generate estimated R-2 (edwR(2) for DTI) and R-2* (eR(2)* for fMRI). Longitudinal iron deposition was measured using the normalized signal change across time for each subject. Validation using baseline QSM, derived from susceptibility-weighted imaging, was performed on 46 male and 58 female participants. Normalized iron deposition estimates from DTI and fMRI correlated with age in most regions; both estimates indicated less iron in boys than girls. QSM results correlated highly with DTI and fMRI results (adjusted R-2 = 0.643 for DTI, 0.578 for fMRI). Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses indicated an initial rapid increase in iron, notably in the putamen and red nucleus, that slowed with age. DTI and fMRI data can be repurposed for identifying regional brain iron deposition in developing adolescents as validated with high correspondence with QSM.

Functional MRI and EEG Index Complementary Attentional Modulations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; contrast response functions; EEG; fMRI	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; CONTRAST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DIRECTED ATTENTION; STIMULUS SELECTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; PRIORITY MAPS	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two noninvasive methods commonly used to study neural mechanisms supporting visual attention in humans. Studies using these tools, which have complementary spatial and temporal resolutions, implicitly assume they index similar underlying neural modulations related to external stimulus and internal attentional manipulations. Accordingly, they are often used interchangeably for constraining understanding about the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on neural modulations. To test this core assumption, we simultaneously manipulated bottom-up sensory inputs by varying stimulus contrast and top-down cognitive modulations by changing the focus of spatial attention. Each of the male and female subjects participated in both fMRI and EEG sessions performing the same experimental paradigm. We found categorically different patterns of attentional modulation on fMRI activity in early visual cortex and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG (e.g., the P1 component and steady-state visually-evoked potentials): fMRI activation scaled additively with attention, whereas evoked EEG components scaled multiplicatively with attention. However, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and oscillatory EEG signals in the alpha band revealed additive attentional modulation patterns like those observed with fMRI. These results challenge prior assumptions that fMRI and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured with EEG can be interchangeably used to index the same neural mechanisms of attentional modulations at different spatiotemporal scales. Instead, fMRI measures of attentional modulations are more closely linked with later EEG components and alpha-band oscillations. Considered together, hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals can jointly constrain understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting cognition.

However, such surgery frequently causes deficits in language function, especially if performed on the dominant hemisphere. In recent years, the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) has been gradually replaced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the preoperative identification of language areas to estimate the risk of postoperative language decline. In this paper, we review the neural substrates for language processing, how language impairment can result both from TLE itself and from surgical attempts to treat it. Subsequently, we discuss the strengths and limitations of, and current indications for fMRI and IAT during the preoperative workup, both by discussion of the studies that have evaluated them individually and through meta-analysis of data from 31 studies deemed eligible for analysis. Electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) is also discussed, as is the usefulness of the novel technique of resting-state fMRI. Finally, surgical techniques designed to avoid or reduce language decline in patients at risk are explored.

A Social Constructivism Decision-Making Approach to Managing Incidental Findings in Neuroimaging Research	ETHICS & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						ethics; incidental findings; neuroimaging; social constructivism	BRAIN MRI; PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS; INVESTIGATORS; DISCLOSURE	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool used in cognitive neuroscientific research. fMRI is noninvasive, safe, and relatively accessible, making it an ideal method to draw inferences about the brain-behavior relationship. When conducting fMRI research, scientists must consider risks associated with brain imaging. In particular, the risk of potentially identifying an abnormal brain finding in an fMRI research scan poses a complex problem that researchers should be prepared to address. This article illustrates how a social constructivism decision-making model can be used as a framework to guide researchers as they develop protocols to address this issue.

J	Özmen, G; Özsen, S				Ozmen, Guzin; Ozsen, Seral			A new denoising method for fMRI based on weighted three-dimensional wavelet transform	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						3D-DWT; fMRI; Gaussian smoothing; Weighting subbands	MR-IMAGES	This study presents a new three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT)-based denoising method for functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI). This method is called weighted three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (w-3D-DWT), and it is based on the principle of weighting the volume subbands which are obtained by 3D-DWT. Briefly, classical DWT denoising consists of wavelet decomposition, thresholding, and image reconstruction steps. In the thresholding algorithm, the thresholding value for each image cannot be chosen exclusively. Namely, a specific thresholding value is chosen and it is used for all images. The proposed algorithm in this study can be considered as a data-driven denoising model for fMRI. It consists of three-dimensional wavelet decomposition, subband weighting, and image reconstruction. The purposes of subband weighting algorithm are to increase the effect of the subband which represents the image better and to decrease the effect of the subband which represents the image in the worst way and thus to reduce the noises of the image adaptively. fMRI is one of the popular methods used to understand brain functions which are often corrupted by noises from various sources. The traditional denoising method used in fMRI is smoothing images with a Gaussian kernel. This study suggests an adaptive approach for fMRI filtering different from Gaussian smoothing and 3D-DWT thresholding. In this study, w-3D-DWT denoising results were evaluated with mean-square error (MSE), peak signal/noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics, and the results were compared with Gaussian smoothing and 3D-DWT thresholding methods. According to this comparison, w-3D-DWT gave low-MSE and high-PSNR results for fMRI data.

METHODS: Forty-three patients with AVMs involving/adjacent to M1 underwent blood oxygen levele-dependent fMRI (BOLD-fMRI) with repetitive finger-to-thumb opposition movements. The generated image sets were processed on the iPlan 3.0 workstation. A site-by-site comparison between the fMRI and ECS maps was performed with the aid of neuronavigation. Surgical outcomes were analyzed as the change between preoperative and postoperative muscle strength (MS). Finally, fMRI sensitivity was calculated, and correlations of lesion-to-activation distances (LAD) and surgery outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The highest activation location was found in the ipsilateral M1 in 40 patients (93%). The highest activation relocated in the contralateral M1area in one patient (2.3%). No motor activation was found in the other 2 (4.7%) patients. ECS results were positive in 34 patients (85%, 34/40). The fMRI sensitivity was calculated as 85%. In total, 18 patients (41.9%) had worsened MS1 week after surgery. Eight patients (18.6%) suffered from permanent muscle strength deterioration 6 months later. Moreover, an LAD <= 5 mm was significantly associated with permanent MS deterioration (P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: BOLD-fMRI exhibits high sensitivity in motor mapping in patients with AVMs. LAD <= 5 mm may be associated with permanent MS deterioration in patients with AVM close to the motor cortex.

Preoperative Mapping of the Supplementary Motor Area in Patients with Brain Tumor Using Resting-State fMRI with Seed-Based Analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; LANGUAGE; NETWORK; RESECTION; CORTEX; BOLD	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:The supplementary motor area can be a critical region in the preoperative planning of patients undergoing brain tumor resection because it plays a role in both language and motor function. While primary motor regions have been successfully identified using resting-state fMRI, there is variability in the literature regarding the identification of the supplementary motor area for preoperative planning. The purpose of our study was to compare resting-state fMRI to task-based fMRI for localization of the supplementary motor area in a large cohort of patients with brain tumors presenting for preoperative brain mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Sixty-six patients with brain tumors were evaluated with resting-state fMRI using seed-based analysis of hand and orofacial motor regions. Rates of supplementary motor area localization were compared with those in healthy controls and with localization results by task-based fMRI. RESULTS:Localization of the supplementary motor area using hand motor seed regions was more effective than seeding using orofacial motor regions for both patients with brain tumor (95.5% versus 34.8%, P < .001) and controls (95.2% versus 45.2%, P < .001). Bilateral hand motor seeding was superior to unilateral hand motor seeding in patients with brain tumor for either side (95.5% versus 75.8%/75.8% for right/left, P < .001). No difference was found in the ability to identify the supplementary motor area between patients with brain tumors and controls. CONCLUSIONS:In addition to task-based fMRI, seed-based analysis of resting-state fMRI represents an equally effective method for supplementary motor area localization in patients with brain tumors, with the best results obtained with bilateral hand motor region seeding.

However, current algorithms require complicated spatial constraints that have only been applied to 2D local neighborhoods because the computational time would be exponentially increased if the same method is applied to 3D spatial neighborhoods. In this study, an efficient and accurate line search sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm has been developed to efficiently solve the 3D local CCA problem with spatial constraints. In addition, a spatially-adaptive kernel CCA (KCCA) method is proposed to increase accuracy of fMRI activation maps. With oriented 3D spatial filters anisotropic shapes can be estimated during the KCCA analysis of fMRI time courses. These filters are orientation-adaptive leading to rotational invariance to better match arbitrary oriented fMRI activation patterns, resulting in improved sensitivity of activation detection while significantly reducing spatial blurring artifacts. The kernel method in its basic form does not require any spatial constraints and analyzes the whole-brain fMRI time series to construct an activation map. Finally, we have developed a penalized kernel CCA model that involves spatial low-pass filter constraints to increase the specificity of the method. The kernel CCA methods are compared with the standard univariate method and with two different local CCA methods that were solved by the SQP algorithm. Results show that SQP is the most efficient algorithm to solve the local constrained CCA problem, and the proposed kernel CCA methods outperformed univariate and local CCA methods in detecting activations for both simulated and real fMRI episodic memory data.

They are often assessed independently with three imaging modalities: SC using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), FC using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG). DWI provides information about white matter organization, allowing the reconstruction of fiber bundles. fMRI uses blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast to indirectly map neuronal activation. MEG and EEG are direct measures of neuronal activity, as they are sensitive to the synchronous inputs in pyramidal neurons. Seminal studies have targeted either the electrophysiological substrate of BOLD or the anatomical basis of FC. However, multimodal comparisons have been scarcely performed, and the relation between SC, fMRI-FC, and MEG-FC is still unclear. Here we present a systematic comparison of SC, resting state fMRI-FC, and MEG-FC between cortical regions, by evaluating their similarities at three different scales: global network, node, and hub distribution. We obtained strong similarities between the three modalities, especially for the following pairwise combinations: SC and fMRI-FC; SC and MEG-FC at theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands; and fMRI-FC and MEG-FC in alpha and beta. Furthermore, highest node similarity was found for regions of the default mode network and primary motor cortex, which also presented the highest hubness score. Distance was partially responsible for these similarities since it biased all three connectivity estimates, but not the unique contributor, since similarities remained after controlling for distance.

A critical element of these analyses is to distinguish variance due to neurobiological signals from variance due to nonneurobiological signals. Multiecho fMRI techniques are a promising means for making such distinctions based on signal decay properties. Here, we report that multiecho fMRI techniques enable excellent removal of certain kinds of artifactual variance, namely, spatially focal artifacts due to motion. By removing these artifacts, multiecho techniques reveal frequent, large-amplitude blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes present across all gray matter that are also linked to motion. These whole-brain BOLD signals could reflect widespread neural processes or other processes, such as alterations in blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) due to ventilation changes. By acquiring multiecho data while monitoring breathing, we demonstrate that whole-brain BOLD signals in the resting state are often caused by changes in breathing that co-occur with head motion. These widespread respiratory fMRI signals cannot be isolated from neurobiological signals by multiecho techniques because they occur via the same BOLD mechanism. Respiratory signals must therefore be removed by some other technique to isolate neurobiological covariance in fMRI time series. Several methods for removing global artifacts are demonstrated and compared, and were found to yield fMRI time series essentially free of motion-related influences. These results identify two kinds of motion-associated fMRI variance, with different physical mechanisms and spatial profiles, each of which strongly and differentially influences functional connectivity patterns. Distance-dependent patterns in covariance are nearly entirely attributable to non-BOLD artifacts.

Validation of non-REM sleep stage decoding from resting state fMRI using linear support vector machines	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; EEG; EEG-fMRI; Sleep; Classification	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; MRI; CLASSIFICATION; FLUCTUATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; MODULATION; FREQUENCY; DURATION	A growing body of literature suggests that changes in consciousness are reflected in specific connectivity patterns of the brain as obtained from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI). As simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) is often unavailable, decoding of potentially confounding sleep patterns from rs-fMRI itself might be useful and improve data interpretation. Linear support vector machine classifiers were trained on combined rs-fMRI/EEG recordings from 25 subjects to separate wakefulness (S0) from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages 1 (S1), 2 (S2), slow wave sleep (SW) and all three sleep stages combined (SX). Classifier performance was quantified by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) and on an independent validation dataset comprising 19 subjects. Results demonstrated excellent performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCs) close to 1.0 for the discrimination of sleep from wakefulness (S0 vertical bar SX), S0 vertical bar S1, S0 vertical bar S2 and S0|SW, and good to excellent performance for the classification between sleep stages (S1 vertical bar S2: similar to 0.9; S1 vertical bar SW:similar to 1.0; S2 vertical bar SW:similar to 0.8). Application windows of fMRI data from about 70 s were found as minimum to provide reliable classifications. Discrimination patterns pointed to subcortical-cortical connectivity and within-occipital lobe reorganization of connectivity as strongest carriers of discriminative information. In conclusion, we report that functional connectivity analysis allows valid classification of NREM sleep stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Altmann, A.; Schroeter, M.

A shortcoming of spike-based EEG-fMRI studies is their inability to provide information about behavior of epileptic generators when no spikes are visible. New method: We extract time series of epileptic components identified on EEG and fit them with Generalized Linear Model (GLM) model. This allows a precise and reliable localization of epileptic foci in addition to predicting generator's behavior. The proposed method works in the source domain and delineates generators considering spatial correlation between spike template and candidate components in addition to patient's medical records. Results: The proposed method was applied on 20 patients with refractory epilepsy and 20 age- and gender matched healthy controls. The identified components were examined statistically and threshold of localization accuracy was determined as 86% based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were found to be 88%, 85%, and 95%, respectively. Contribution of EEG-fMRI and concordance between EEG and fMRI were also evaluated. Concordance was found in 19 patients and contribution in 17. Comparison with existing methods: We compared the proposed method with conventional methods. Our comparisons showed superiority of the proposed method. In particular, when epileptogenic zone was located deep in the brain, the method outperformed existing methods. Conclusions: This study contributes substantially to increasing the yield of EEG-fMRI and presents a realistic estimate of the neural behavior of epileptic generators, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time in the literature.

The present study aimed to illustrate potential differences between PD patients and healthy controls in terms of neural activity and functional connectivity within the olfactory brain network. Twenty PD patients and twenty healthy controls were examined with olfactory fMRI and resting-state fMRI. Data analysis of olfactory fMRI included data-driven tensorial independent component (ICA) and task-driven general linear model (GLM) analyses. Data analysis of resting-state fMRI included probabilistic ICA based on temporal concatenation and functional connectivity analysis within the olfactory network. ICA of olfactory fMRI identified an olfactory network consisting of the posterior piriform cortex, insula, right orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus. Recruitment of this network was less significant for PD patients. GLM analysis revealed significantly lower activity in the insula bilaterally and the right orbitofrontal cortex in PD compared to healthy controls but no significant differences in the olfactory cortex itself. Analysis of resting-state fMRI did not reveal any differences in the functional connectivity within the olfactory, default mode, salience or central executive networks between the two groups. In conclusion, olfactory dysfunction in PD is associated with less significant recruitment of the olfactory brain network. ICA could demonstrate differences in both the olfactory cortex and its main projections, compared to GLM that revealed differences only on the latter. Resting-state fMRI did not reveal any significant differences in functional connectivity within the olfactory, default mode, salience and central executive networks in this cohort.

Three spatial convolution architectures implement this parallel multidimensional filtering algorithm in Virtex-6 FPGA board, as automated 4D fMRI filtering systems. These three automated filtering systems are devised as "plug and develop" processors to filter any 4D volumetric data. Then, two sets of generic Edge and noise smoothing filtering operators are prototypically plugged and developed to be improved for filtering a dementia case study of color 256 x 256 x 4 x 3 volumetric fMRI. Accordingly, performance indices of the three architectures are evaluated as a complete package of area, speed, dynamic power, and throughput. Significant improvements have been achieved in keeping a stable speed, decreasing power consumption and increasing throughput in color fMRI filtering applications. All three architectures have an operating (225 MHz) maximum frequency. The power consumption improved more than two-fold using architecture 2 compared to 3. The highest throughput is achieved by architectures 2 and 3 almost (2.5) times than that of architecture 1. Evidently, all three architectures are performance-aware processors, and architecture 2 is optimal.

Neuroimaging of individual differences: A latent variable modeling perspective	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Article						Latent variable; Structural equation modeling; Psychometrics; Human connectome project	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FMRI RELIABILITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; NIH TOOLBOX; TASK; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIVITY	Neuroimaging data is being increasingly utilized to address questions of individual difference. When examined with task-related fMRI (t-fMRI), individual differences are typically investigated via correlations between the BOLD activation signal at every voxel and a particular behavioral measure. This can be problematic because: 1) correlational designs require evaluation of t-fMRI psychometric properties, yet these are not well understood; and 2) bivariate correlations are severely limited in modeling the complexities of brain-behavior relationships. Analytic tools from psychometric theory such as latent variable modeling (e.g., structural equation modeling) can help simultaneously address both concerns. This review explores the advantages gained from integrating psychometric theory and methods with cognitive neuroscience for the assessment and interpretation of individual differences. The first section provides background on classic and modem psychometric theories and analytics. The second section details current approaches to t-fMRI individual difference analyses and their psychometric limitations. The last section uses data from the Human Connectome Project to provide illustrative examples of how t-fMRI individual differences research can benefit by utilizing latent variable models.

In this work, we investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of complexity (MSE) of electrophysiology and fMRI signals and their relations to functional connectivity (FC). MSE and FC analyses were performed on simulated data using neural mass model based brain network model with the Brain Dynamics Toolbox, on animal models with concurrent recording of fMRI and electrophysiology in conjunction with pharmacological manipulations, and on resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results show that the complexity of regional electrophysiology and fMRI signals is positively correlated with network FC. The associations between MSE and FC are dependent on the temporal scales or frequencies, with higher associations between MSE and FC at lower temporal frequencies. Our results from theoretical modeling, animal experiment and human fMRI indicate that (1) Regional neural complexity and network FC may be two related aspects of brain's information processing: the more complex regional neural activity, the higher FC this region has with other brain regions; (2) MSE at high and low frequencies may represent local and distributed information processing across brain regions. Based on literature and our data, we propose that the complexity of regional neural signals may serve as an index of the brain's capacity of information processing-increased complexity may indicate greater transition or exploration between different states of brain networks, thereby a greater propensity for information processing.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments provide great opportunities to recognize relation between the active areas in the brain, discovered by fMRI, and EEG events. However, decoding EEG is challenging as a result of artifacts which MRI scanner applies on EEG. Ballistocardiogram (BCG) is one of the main destructive artifacts which deteriorates EEG rhythms specially in mu band. The proposed method, is a supervised time-frequency decomposition algorithm which estimates underlying rhythms of EEG signals recorded in MRI scanner. In the proposed method, a multi layer decomposition approach using three criteria is developed to extract brain oscillations. This goal is achieved by eliminating the artifact related components at each decomposition layer as a result of removing useless extracted components in each layer. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using synthetic and real EEG. The achieved results from synthetic data confirm the ability of the proposed method to extract mu rhythms when different levels of noise exist. In addition, proposed algorithm is applied on a set of real EEG acquired in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording. Estimated ERD confirms the superiority of the developed algorithm in terms of estimating changes of mu rhythms. Moreover, an EEG-fMRI integration is performed to explore the correlation between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) in fMRI and ERD of mu rhythm in EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Presurgical language fMRI: Mapping of six critical regions	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						language; fMRI; epilepsy; surgery; neurology; neuropsychology	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EPILEPSY SURGERY; AREA; LATERALIZATION; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; SPEECH; COMPREHENSION; STIMULATION	Language mapping is a key goal in neurosurgical planning. fMRI mapping typically proceeds with a focus on Broca's and Wernicke's areas, although multiple other language-critical areas are now well-known. We evaluated whether clinicians could use a novel approach, including clinician-driven individualized thresholding, to reliably identify six language regions, including Broca's Area, Wernicke's Area (inferior, superior), Exner's Area, Supplementary Speech Area, Angular Gyrus, and Basal Temporal Language Area. We studied 22 epilepsy and tumor patients who received Wada and fMRI (age 36.4[12.5]; Wada language left/right/mixed in 18/3/1). fMRI tasks (two x three tasks) were analyzed by two clinical neuropsychologists who flexibly thresholded and combined these to identify the six regions. The resulting maps were compared to fixed threshold maps. Clinicians generated maps that overlapped significantly, and were highly consistent, when at least one task came from the same set. Cases diverged when clinicians prioritized different language regions or addressed noise differently. Language laterality closely mirrored Wada data (85% accuracy). Activation consistent with all six language regions was consistently identified. In blind review, three external, independent clinicians rated the individualized fMRI language maps as superior to fixed threshold maps; identified the majority of regions significantly more frequently; and judged language laterality to mirror Wada lateralization more often. These data provide initial validation of a novel, clinician-based approach to localizing language cortex. They also demonstrate clinical fMRI is superior when analyzed by an experienced clinician and that when fMRI data is of low quality judgments of laterality are unreliable and should be withheld.

Four hundred and ninety-one consecutive patients undergoing presurgical fMRI between 2000 and 2012 on five different MR-scanners using established paradigms and semi-automated data processing were included. Success rates of task performance and BOLD-activation were determined for motor and somatosensory somatotopic mapping and language localisation. Procedural success, failures and imaging artifacts were analysed. MR-field strengths were compared. Two thousand three hundred fifteen of 2348 (98.6 %) attempted paradigms (1033 motor, 1220 speech, 95 somatosensory) were successfully performed. 100 paradigms (4.3 %) were repetition runs. 23 speech, 6 motor and 2 sensory paradigms failed for non-compliance and technical issues. Most language paradigm failures were noted in overt sentence generation. Average significant BOLD-activation was higher for motor than language paradigms (95.8 vs. 81.6 %). Most language paradigms showed significantly higher activation rates at 3 T compared to 1.5 T, whereas no significant difference was found for motor paradigms. fMRI proved very robust for the presurgical localisation of the different motor and somatosensory body representations, as well as Broca's and Wernicke's language areas across different MR-scanners at 1.5 and 3.0 T over 13 years. aEuro cent Standardised presurgical motor and language fMRI is robust across various MRI platforms. aEuro cent Motor fMRI is less dependent on field strength than language fMRI. aEuro cent fMRI task failures are relatively low and are reduced by paradigm repetition.

However, there is considerable controversy over its use because of the potential bias that can be introduced when it is applied to the analysis of both task-related and resting-state fMRI studies. In this paper we take a closer look at the global signal, examining in detail the various sources that can contribute to the signal. For the most part, the global signal has been treated as a nuisance term, but there is growing evidence that it may also contain valuable information. We also examine the various ways that the global signal has been used in the analysis of fMRI data, including global signal regression, global signal subtraction, and global signal normalization. Furthermore, we describe new ways for understanding the effects of global signal regression and its relation to the other approaches.

Promising initial work on a detection of neuronal activity via quantitative susceptibility mapping (fQSM) has been published but consistently reported on ill-understood positive and negative activation patterns (Balla et al., 2014; Chen and Calhoun, 2015a). We set out to (i) demonstrate that fQSM can exploit established fMRI data acquisition and processing methods and to (ii) better describe aspects of the apparent activation patterns using fMRI and PET as standards of reference. Under a standardized visual-stimulation paradigm PET and 3-T gradient-echo EPI-based fQSM, fMRI data from 9 healthy volunteers were acquired and analyzed by means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) at subject level and, for the first time, at group level. Numbers of activated (z-score > 2.0) voxels were counted and their mean z-scores calculated in volumes of interest (occipital lobe (N-occ_(lobe)), segmented occipital gray-matter (N-GM_occ_lobe), large veins (N-veins)), and in occipital-lobe voxels commonly activated in fQSM and fMRI component maps. Common but not entirely congruent regions of apparent activation were found in the occipital lobe in z-score maps from all modalities, fQSM, fMRI and PET, with distinct BOLD-negatively correlated regions in fQSM data. At subject-level, N-occ_(lobe), NGM_occ_lobe and their mean z-scores were significantly smaller in fQSM than in fMRI, but their ratio, N-GM_occ_lobe/N-occ_lobe, was comparable. N-veins did not statistically differ and the ratio N-veins/N-GM_occ_lobe as well as the mean z-scores were higher for fQSM than for fMRI. In veins and immediate vicinity, z-score maps derived from both phase and fQSM-data showed positive and negative lobes resembling dipole shapes in simulated field and phase maps with no correlate in fMRI or PET data. Our results show that standard fMRI tools can directly be used for fQSM processing, and suggest that fQSM may have the potential to detect gray-matter activation distant from large veins, to improve detection of veins with stimulus-induced venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) variations, and to better localize areas of activation. However, our results seem to clearly expose issues that phenomenologically resemble an incomplete dipolar inversion and that need to be subject to further investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the temporal limitations of the fMRI methodology have made it difficult to assess the transient network dynamics by which these distributed regions coordinate activity. Recent evidence suggests that beta oscillations (17-20 Hz) are important for top-down control for memory suppression. However, the spatial limitations of the EEG methodology make it difficult to assess the relationship between these oscillatory signals and the distributed networks identified with fMRI. This study used simultaneous EEG/fMRI to identify networks related to beta oscillations during episodic retrieval. Participants studied adjectives and either imagined a scene (Place Task) or judged its pleasantness (Pleasant Task). During the recognition test, participants decided which task was performed with each word (Old Place Task or Old Pleasant Task) or New. EEG results revealed that posterior beta power was greater for new than old words. fMRI results revealed activity in a frontal, parietal network that was greater for old than new words, consistent with prior studies. Although overall beta power increases correlated with decreased activity within a predominantly parietal network, within the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral pFC, beta power correlated with BOLD activity more under conditions requiring more cognitive control and EEG/fMRI effects in the right frontal cortex correlated with BOLD activity in a frontoparietal network. Therefore, using simultaneous EEG and fMRI, the present results suggest that beta oscillations are related to postretrieval control operations in the right frontal cortex and act within a broader postretrieval control network.

However, most popular ICA algorithms for fMRI analysis make several simplifying assumptions, thus ignoring sources of statistical information, types of "diversity," and limiting their performance. New method: We propose the use of complex entropy rate bound minimization (CERBM) for the analysis of actual fMRI data in its native, complex, domain. Though CERBM achieves enhanced performance through the exploitation of the three types of diversity inherent to complex fMRI data: noncircularity, non-Gaussianity, and sample-to-sample dependence, CERBM produces results that are more variable than simpler methods. This motivates the development of a minimum spanning tree (MST)-based stability analysis that mitigates the variability of CERBM. Comparison with existing methods: In order to validate our method, we compare the performance of CERBM with the popular CInfomax as well as complex entropy bound minimization (CEBM). Results: We show that by leveraging CERBM and the MST-based stability analysis, we are able to consistently produce components that have a greater number of activated voxels in physically meaningful regions and can more accurately classify patients with schizophrenia than components generated using simpler models. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the advantages of using ICA algorithms that can exploit all inherent types of diversity for the analysis of fMRI data when coupled with appropriate stability analyses.

The aim of this study is the integration of MEG and fMRI maps into a CyberKnife (CK) system to optimize dose planning. METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases in the motor area underwent functional imaging study of the hand motor cortex before radiosurgery. MEG data were acquired during a visually cued hand motor task. Motor activations were identified also using an fMRI block-designed paradigm. MEG and fMRI maps were then integrated into a CK system and contoured as organs at risk for treatment planning optimization. RESULTS: The integration of fMRI data into the CK system was achieved for all patients by means of a standardized protocol. We also implemented an ad hoc pipeline to convert the MEG signal into a DICOM standard, to make sure that it was readable by our CK treatment planning system. Inclusion of the activation areas into the optimization plan allowed the creation of treatment plans that reduced the irradiation of the motor cortex yet not affecting the brain peripheral dose. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of advanced neuroimaging techniques is playing an increasingly important role in radiosurgical planning strategy. We successfully imported MEG and fMRI activations into a CK system. This additional information can improve dose sparing of eloquent areas, allowing a more comprehensive investigation of the related dose-volume constraints that in theory could translate into a gain in tumor local control, and a reduction of neurological complications.

Polygraphy and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Lie Detection: A Controlled Blind Comparison Using the Concealed Information Test	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PATIENT SELF-REPORTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SKIN-CONDUCTANCE; DRUG-USE; ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DECEPTION; FMRI; ACTIVATION; VALIDITY	Objective: Intentional deception is a common act that often has detrimental social, legal, and clinical implications. In the last decade, brain activation patterns associated with deception have been mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), significantly expanding our theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. However, despite substantial criticism, polygraphy remains the only biological method of lie detection in practical use today. We conducted a blind, prospective, and controlled within-subjects study to compare the accuracy of fMRI and polygraphy in the detection of concealed information. Data were collected between July 2008 and August 2009. Method: Participants (N = 28) secretly wrote down a number between 3 and 8 on a slip of paper and were questioned about what number they wrote during consecutive and counterbalanced fMRI and polygraphy sessions. The Concealed Information Test (CIT) paradigm was used to evoke deceptive responses about the concealed number. Each participant's preprocessed fMRI images and 5-channel polygraph data were independently evaluated by 3 fMRI and 3 polygraph experts, who made an independent determination of the number the participant wrote down and concealed. Results: Using a logistic regression, we found that fMRI experts were 24% more likely (relative risk = 1.24, P < .001) to detect the concealed number than the polygraphy experts. Incidentally, when 2 out of 3 raters in each modality agreed on a number (N = 17), the combined accuracy was 100%. Conclusions: These data justify further evaluation of fMRI as a potential alternative to polygraphy. The sequential or concurrent use of psychophysiology and neuroimaging in lie detection also deserves new consideration. (C) Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

To date, amygdala volitional regulation could be obtained only via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a highly inaccessible procedure. The current article presents high-impact neurobehavioral implications of a novel imaging approach that enables bedside monitoring of amygdala activity using fMRI-inspired electroencephalography (EEG), hereafter termed amygdala-electrical fingerprint (amyg-EFP). Simultaneous EEG/fMRI indicated that the amyg-EFP reliably predicts amygdala-blood oxygen level-dependent activity. Implementing the amyg-EFP in neurofeedback demonstrated that learned downregulation of the amyg-EFP facilitated volitional downregulation of amygdala-blood oxygen level-dependent activity via real-time fMRI and manifested as reduced amygdala reactivity to visual stimuli. Behavioral evidence further emphasized the therapeutic potential of this approach by showing improved implicit emotion regulation following amyg-EFP neurofeedback. Additional EFP models denoting different brain regions could provide a library of localized activity for low-cost and highly accessible brain-based diagnosis and treatment.

Evaluation of an fMRI USPIO-based assay in healthy human volunteers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						fMRI; ferumoxytol; cerebral blood volume; visual stimulation; drug development	CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; CONTRAST AGENT; TRANSVERSE RELAXATION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; WHOLE-BRAIN; SPINAL-CORD; BOLD; STIMULATION; FERUMOXYTOL; TIME	PurposeTo present the testretest and contrast dose effect results of cerebral blood volume (CBV) functional MRI (fMRI) in healthy human volunteers using ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an ultrasmall-superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticle. Materials and MethodsThis was an open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence study in healthy young volunteers. In eight subjects, using a 3 Tesla field strength system, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and CBV fMRI were acquired in response to a visual black-and-white checkboard stimulation paradigm using an escalating ferumoxytol dose design (250, 350, and 510mg iron). Multiple outcome measures were analyzed including absolute percent signal change (|PSC|, primary endpoint), its contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and corresponding z-score, percent CBV change (CBV) and respective CNR, concentration of Fe, and baseline CBV. ResultsThe |PSC| in the visual cortex increased with ferumoxytol dose and was up to 3xhigher than BOLD fMRI. Test-retest reliability was comparable for BOLD and CBV fMRI. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for |PSC| were 0.3 (one-sided 95% lower confidence limit=0.00), 0.81 (0.47), 0.48 (0.00), and 0.3 (0.00) for BOLD and the 250-, 350-, and 510-mg doses of ferumoxytol, respectively. For CBV, ICCs were 0.77 (0.37), 0.48 (0.00), and 0.49 (0.00) for 250mg, 350mg, and 510mg, respectively. ConclusionThis work demonstrates that CBV fMRI techniques and endpoints are dose dependent, robust and have good test-retest repeatability. It also confirms previous findings that USPIO enhances sensitivity of fMRI stimulus-response endpoints. Level of Evidence: 1 J. MAGN. RESON.

Our goal was to define a novel indicator of neuronal activity based on a first-order textural feature of the resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) signal. Furthermore, we examined the association between this neuronal activity metric and glucose metabolism from F-18 FDG-PET. We studied 15 normal elderly controls (NEC) and 15 probable Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. An independent component analysis was applied to the RS-fMRI, followed by template matching to identify neuronal components (NC). A regional brain activity measurement was constructed based on the variation of the RS-fMRI signal of these NC. The standardized glucose uptake values of several brain regions relative to the cerebellum (SUVR) were measured from partial volume corrected FDG-PET images. Comparing the AD and NEC groups, the mean brain activity metric was significantly lower in the accumbens, while the glucose SUVR was significantly lower in the amygdala and hippocampus. The RS-fMRI brain activity metric was positively correlated with cognitive measures and amyloid beta 1-42 cerebral spinal fluid levels; however, these did not remain significant following Bonferroni correction. There was a significant linear correlation between the brain activity metric and the glucose SUVR measurements. This proof of concept study demonstrates that this novel and easy to implement RS-fMRI brain activity metric can differentiate a group of healthy elderly controls from a group of people with AD.

Pre-Surgical Integration of fMRI and DTI of the Sensorimotor System in Transcortical Resection of a High-Grade Insular Astrocytoma	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						insular astrocytoma; fMRI; DTI; motor and sensory localization; pre-surgical planning	EXTENT; REPRESENTATIONS; TUMORS	Herein we report on a patient with a WHO Grade III astrocytoma in the right insular region in close proximity to the internal capsule who underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy. Total gross resection of insular gliomas remains surgically challenging based on the possibility of damage to the corticospinal tracts. However, maximizing the extent of resection has been shown to decrease future adverse outcomes. Thus, the goal of such surgeries should focus on maximizing extent of resection while minimizing possible adverse outcomes. In this case, pre-surgical planning included integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to localize motor and sensory pathways. Novel fMRI tasks were individually developed for the patient to maximize both somatosensory and motor activation simultaneously in areas in close proximity to the tumor. Information obtained was used to optimize resection trajectory and extent, facilitating gross total resection of the astrocytoma. Across all three motor-sensory tasks administered, fMRI revealed an area of interest just superior and lateral to the astrocytoma. Further, DTI analyses showed displacement of the corona radiata around the superior dorsal surface of the astrocytoma, extending in the direction of the activation found using fMRI. Taking into account these results, a transcortical superior temporal gyrus surgical approach was chosen in order to avoid the area of interest identified by fMRI and DTI. Total gross resection was achieved and minor post-surgical motor and sensory deficits were temporary. This case highlights the utility of comprehensive pre-surgical planning, including fMRI and DTI, to maximize surgical outcomes on a case-by-case basis.	[Ekstrand, Chelsea L.; Mickleborough, Marla J.

Combined task activation display as an effective method to teach introductory fMRI users	CLINICAL IMAGING			English	Article						BOLD; Conjunction analysis; Epilepsy; Brain mapping	LANGUAGE DOMINANCE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN ACTIVATION; LATERALITY INDEX; WADA TEST; EPILEPSY; HANDEDNESS	Rationale and objectives: Interpreting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be an overwhelming and challenging task for trainees, particularly when post processing, synthesizing and interpreting data from multiple language paradigms. Currently, there is no established best method for teaching fMRI interpretation to new trainees. The purpose of our study is to compare the use of combined task activation display (CTAD) and conventional display of fMRI language paradigms as an effective method to teach fMRI to the introductory learner. Materials and methods: Following IRB approval, 43 unique cases (with 10 repeat cases to assess intra-reader variability) were identified based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eight radiology trainees, without prior exposure to fMRI, were asked to determine language lateralization based on activation of Wernicke's area, Broca's area, and the pre-supplementary motor area. Prior to trainee interpretation, a 15-minute training session was conducted to describe the expected anatomic locations of the language centers. Trainees were asked to determine language dominance using either the CTAD or conventional methods. Following a 6-week washout period, the same eight trainees were asked to interpret the cases using the opposite interpretation approach. Results: Interpreting fMRI with the CTAD method significantly increased trainee accuracy (85.4% vs 70.9% p < 0.001) and trainee confidence (4.3 vs 3.6 p < 0.001), while decreasing time to interpretation (mean difference of 29 min), and intra-reader variability when compared to the conventional approach. Conclusion: Combined task activation display is an effective method to teach fMRI to introductory learners.

Using temporal ICA to selectively remove global noise while preserving global signal in functional MRI data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; MOTION ARTIFACT; EMPIRICAL ANALYSES; NULL-HYPOTHESIS; VISUAL AREAS; BRAIN SIGNAL; TIME-SERIES; BOLD; FLUCTUATIONS; ORGANIZATION	Temporal fluctuations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been profitably used to study brain activity and connectivity for over two decades. Unfortunately, fMRI data also contain structured temporal "noise" from a variety of sources, including subject motion, subject physiology, and the MRI equipment. Recently, methods have been developed to automatically and selectively remove spatially specific structured noise from fMRI data using spatial Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and machine learning classifiers. Spatial ICA is particularly effective at removing spatially specific structured noise from high temporal and spatial resolution fMRI data of the type acquired by the Human Connectome Project and similar studies. However, spatial ICA is mathematically, by design, unable to separate spatially widespread "global" structured noise from fMRI data (e.g., blood flow modulations from subject respiration). No methods currently exist to selectively and completely remove global structured noise while retaining the global signal from neural activity. This has left the field in a quandary-to do or not to do global signal regression-given that both choices have substantial downsides. Here we show that temporal ICA can selectively segregate and remove global structured noise while retaining global neural signal in both task-based and resting state fMRI data. We compare the results before and after temporal ICA cleanup to those from global signal regression and show that temporal ICA cleanup removes the global positive biases caused by global physiological noise without inducing the network-specific negative biases of global signal regression. We believe that temporal ICA cleanup provides a "best of both worlds" solution to the global signal and global noise dilemma and that temporal ICA itself unlocks interesting neurobiological insights from fMRI data.

New method: We propose a compact experimental setup for concurrent EEG-fMRI at 4T and compare it to a more standard reference setup. The compact setup uses short EEG cables connecting to the amplifiers, which are placed right at the back of the head RF coil on a form-fitting extension force-locked to the patient MR bed. We compare the two setups in terms of sensitivity to MR-room environmental noise, interferences between measuring devices (EEG or fMRI), and sensitivity to functional responses in a visual stimulation paradigm. Results: The compact setup reduces the system sensitivity to both external noise and MR-induced artefacts by at least 60%, with negligible EEG noise induced from the mechanical vibrations of the cryogenic cooling compression pump. Comparison with existing methods: The compact setup improved EEG data quality and the overall performance of MR-artifact correction techniques. Both setups were similar in terms of the fMRI data, with higher reproducibility for cable placement within the scanner in the compact setup. Conclusions: This improved compact setup may be relevant to MR laboratories interested in reducing the sensitivity of their EEG-fMRI experimental setup to external noise sources, setting up an EEG-fMRI workplace for the first time, or for creating a more reproducible configuration of equipment and cables. Implications for safety and ergonomics are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-modality fMRI with simultaneous hippocampal electrophysiological recording reveal broad cortical correlation patterns, but the detailed spatial hippocampal functional map remains lacking given the limited fMRI resolution. In particular, hemodynamic responses linked to specific neural activity are unclear at the single-vessel level across hippocampal vasculature, which hinders the deciphering of the hippocampal malfunction in animal models and the translation to critical neurovascular coupling (NVC) patterns for human fMRI. We simultaneously acquired optogenetically-driven neuronal Ca2+ signals with single-vessel blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-fMRI from individual venules and arterioles. Distinct spatiotemporal patterns of hippocampal hemodynamic responses were correlated to optogenetically evoked and spreading depression-like calcium events. The calcium event-related single-vessel hemodynamic modeling revealed significantly reduced NVC efficiency upon spreading depression-like (SDL) events, providing a direct measure of the NVC function at various hippocampal states.

Electroencephalography (EEG), on the other hands, looks at cortical electrical impulses of the brain thus detecting brainwave patterns during rest and thought processing. The combination of these two modalities is called fMRI with simultaneous EEG (fMRI-EEG), which has emerged as a new tool for experimental neuroscience assessments and has been applied clinically in many settings, most commonly in epilepsy cases. Recent advances in imaging has led to fMRI-EEG being utilized in behavioural studies which can help in giving an objective assessment of ambiguous cases and help in the assessment of response to treatment by providing a non-invasive biomarker of the disease processes. We aim to review the role and interpretation of fMRI-EEG in studies pertaining to psychiatric disorders and behavioral abnormalities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Implications of neurovascular uncoupling in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumors	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Review						Neurovascular; coupling; functional magnetic resonance imaging; cancer; angiogenesis; cooption	INTERSTITIAL FLUID PRESSURE; ANTI-ANGIOGENIC THERAPY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; RESTING-STATE FMRI; LOW-GRADE; VASCULAR NORMALIZATION; DRUG-DELIVERY; GROWTH-FACTOR; MOTOR CORTEX; IN-VIVO	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a critical tool for presurgical mapping of eloquent cortex and changes in neurological function in patients diagnosed with brain tumors. However, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism underlying fMRI assumes that neurovascular coupling remains intact during brain tumor progression, and that measured changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) are correlated with neuronal function. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that even low-grade brain tumors can exhibit neurovascular uncoupling (NVU), which can confound interpretation of fMRI data. Therefore, to avoid neurosurgical complications, it is crucial to understand the biophysical basis of NVU and its impact on fMRI. Here we review the physiology of the neurovascular unit, how it is remodeled, and functionally altered by brain cancer cells. We first discuss the latest findings about the components of the neurovascular unit. Next, we synthesize results from preclinical and clinical studies to illustrate how brain tumor induced NVU affects fMRI data interpretation. We examine advances in functional imaging methods that permit the clinical evaluation of brain tumors with NVU. Finally, we discuss how the suppression of anomalous tumor blood vessel formation with antiangiogenic therapies can "normalize'' the brain tumor vasculature, and potentially restore neurovascular coupling.

So the measurements were conducted to compare the effects of three electrodes, three electrode gels and their combinations on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MR images at 3 T. Local temperature variation of the phantom for all conditions was also measured in the scanner. Results show that combination of silver-plated copper electrode and electrode gel (composed of carbomer as its main ingredient, with 85% moisture) is best for EEG-fMRI experiments. A sintered Ag/AgCl electrode could also be used as the material of EEG cap if infra-slow EEG-events need to be acquired in EEG-fMRI recording. Additionally, there is no significant heat induction detected. Overall, the methods and results of this study can be used for selecting appropriate EEG electrodes and electrode gels in EEG-fMRI experiments.

The existing studies differ in a number of methodological parameters. This study provides a literature review of the main parameters and results of studies using rt-fMRI-NF for emotion regulation enhancement. Method: A search of the Web of Science database up through November 8, 2018, identified 144 articles written in English, 89 of which were excluded as irrelevant for this study. The remaining 51 original studies and four secondary analyses of previously published original studies were included in the literature review. The selection of target brain areas, target populations, emotion regulation protocols, NF presentation, control group types, and emotion regulation instructions were examined in relation to achieved brain regulation and changes in cognitive or clinical outcomes. Study results were evaluated in terms of their statistical robustness. Results: The results show that healthy people are able to regulate their brain activity in the presence of rt-fMRI-NF from various brain regions related to emotion regulation, including the amygdala, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. The regulation of brain activity using rt-fMRI-NF from prefrontal-limbic connectivity or from individually navigated brain areas is feasible as well. Most studies that used a control group show that rt-fMRI-NF actually induces some effects on brain regulation, cognitive variables, and clinical variables. Generally, the success of ROI regulation during NF training is related to the combination of target brain region, the type of emotion regulation task, and the population undergoing the training. In terms of patient groups, the strongest support for the beneficial effects of rt-fMRI-NF has been shown in increased positive emotion experiencing in patients with depression and in decreased anxiety in patients with anxiety disorders. Symptom reduction following NF training has been also reported in patients with PTSD, BPD, and schizophrenia, but direct comparisons with control groups in these studies makes it impossible to evaluate the added value of NF. Studies often do not report all the relevant analyses for evaluating NF success and many studies lack statistical robustness. Conclusions: Overall, rt-fMRI-NF seems a promising tool for emotion regulation enhancement with the potential to induce long-term symptom reduction in patients with various mental disorders. Preplanning of statistical analyses, careful interpretations of the results, and evaluations of the NF effect on symptom reduction in patient groups is recommended.

Analysis focused on EEG power, BOLD fMRI, and accuracy. Lower EEG beta power and lower left auditory cortex fMRI activity were seen in ASD compared to NT when they were presented with auditory stimuli as demonstrated by contrasting the activity from the second presentation of an auditory stimulus in an all auditory block vs. the second presentation of a visual stimulus in an all visual block (AA2-VV2).We conclude that in ASD, combined audiovisual processing is more similar than unimodal processing to NTs.

However, because of the variety of rs-fMRI processing methods, the necessity of rs-fMRI quality assurance is increasing. Conventionally, the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is generally adopted for quality examination, but the tSNR does not guarantee reliable functional connectivity (FC) outcomes. Theoretically, intrinsic FC is supposed to reflect the spontaneous synchronization of neuronal basis, rather than that from thermal noise or non-neuronal physiological noise. Therefore, we proposed a new quality-assurance index for rs-fMRI to estimate the physiological contributions in spontaneous oscillations (PICSO). The PICSO index was designed as a voxel-wise measure for facilitating practical applications to all existing rs-fMRI data sets on the basis of two assumptions: Gaussian distributions in temporal fluctuations and ultra-slow changes of neural-based physiological fluctuations. To thoroughly validate the sensitivity of the proposed PICSO index to FC, we calibrated the preprocessing steps according to phantom data and verified the relationship between the PICSO and factors that are considered to affect FC in healthy participants (n = 12). Our results demonstrated that FC showed a significantly positive correlation with the PICSO. Moreover, for generating robust FC outcomes, directly acquiring data at a relatively large voxel size was more effective than performing smoothness on high-resolution data sets. In conclusion, compared with tSNR, the PICSO index is more sensitive to the resulting FC, providing a practical quality-assurance indicator for all existing rs-fMRI data sets.

However, most fMRI studies in rodents are performed under anesthesia, which greatly limits the scope of their application, and behavioral relevance. Efforts have been made to image rodents in the awake condition, either in the resting state or in response to sensory or optogenetic stimulation. However, fMRI in awake behaving rodents has not yet been achieved. In the current study, a novel fMRI paradigm for awake and behaving mice was developed, allowing functional imaging of the mouse brain in an olfaction-based go/no-go task. High resolution functional imaging with limited motion and image distortion were achieved at 9.4T with a cryogenic coil in awake and behaving mice. Distributed whole-brain spatiotemporal patterns were revealed, with drastically different activity profiles for go versus no-go trials. Therefore, we have demonstrated the feasibility of functional imaging of an olfactory behavior in awake mice. This fMRI paradigm in awake behaving mice could lead to novel insights into neural mechanisms underlying behaviors at a whole-brain level.

In humans with PD, lower extremity forced-exercise (FE) produced global improvements in motor symptoms based on clinical ratings and biomechanical measures of upper extremity function. Methods: fMRI was used to compare the underlying changes in brain activity in PD patients following the administration of anti-parkinsonian medication and following a session of FE. Results: Nine individuals with PD completed fMRI scans under each condition: off anti-PD medication, on anti-PD medication, and off medication + FE. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Motor Scale scores improved by 50% in the FE condition compared to the off-medication condition. The pattern of fMRI activation after FE was similar to that seen with anti-PD medication. Direct comparison of the fMRI activation patterns showed high correlation between FE and anti-PD medication. Conclusion: These findings suggest that medication and FE likely utilize the same pathways to produce symptomatic relief in individuals with PD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of orientation and attention during surround suppression of small image features: A 7 Tesla fMRI study	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						surround suppression; functional MRI; attention; contextual modulation; contrast response function	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTRAST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; STRIATE CORTEX; NEGATIVE BOLD; V1 NEURONS; MACAQUE; PSYCHOPHYSICS	Although V1 responses are driven primarily by elements within a neuron's receptive field, which subtends about 18 visual angle in parafoveal regions, previous work has shown that localized fMRI responses to visual elements reflect not only local feature encoding but also long-range pattern attributes. However, separating the response to an image feature from the response to the surrounding stimulus and studying the interactions between these two responses demands both spatial precision and signal independence, which may be challenging to attain with fMRI. The present study used 7 Tesla fMRI with 1.2-mm resolution to measure the interactions between small sinusoidal grating patches (targets) at 38 eccentricity and surrounds of various sizes and orientations to test the conditions under which localized, context-dependent fMRI responses could be predicted from either psychophysical or electrophysiological data. Targets were presented at 8%, 16%, and 32% contrast while manipulating (a) spatial extent of parallel (strongly suppressive) or orthogonal (weakly suppressive) surrounds, (b) locus of attention, (c) stimulus onset asynchrony between target and surround, and (d) blocked versus even-trelated design. In all experiments, the V1 fMRI signal was lower when target stimuli were flanked by parallel versus orthogonal context. Attention amplified fMRI responses to all stimuli but did not show a selective effect on central target responses or a measurable effect on orientation-dependent surround suppression. Suppression of the V1 fMRI response by parallel surrounds was stronger than predicted from psychophysics but showed a better match to previous electrophysiological reports.

From evoked potentials to cortical currents: Resolving V1 and V2 components using retinotopy constrained source estimation without fMRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						visual evoked potential; visual evoked current; retinotopy constrained source estimation; EEG; dipole model; fMRI	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; VISUAL-FIELD; STRIATE CORTEX; MEG; HEAD; RESOLUTION; PATTERN; MEG/EEG; MODELS	Despite evoked potentials' (EP) ubiquity in research and clinical medicine, insights are limited to gross brain dynamics as it remains challenging to map surface potentials to their sources in specific cortical regions. Multiple sources cancellation due to cortical folding and cross-talk obscures close sources, e.g. between visual areas V1 and V2. Recently retinotopic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses were used to constrain source locations to assist separating close sources and to determine cortical current generators. However, an fMRI is largely infeasible for routine EP investigation. We developed a novel method that replaces the fMRI derived retinotopic layout (RL) by an approach where the retinotopy and current estimates are generated from EEG or MEG signals and a standard clinical T1-weighted anatomical MRI. Using the EEG-RL, sources were localized to within 2 mm of the fMRI-RL constrained localized sources. The EEG-RL also produced V1 and V2 current waveforms that closely matched the fMRI-RL's (n = 2) r((1,198))=0.99, P < 0.0001. Applying the method to subjects without fMRI (n = 4) demonstrates it generates waveforms that agree closely with the literature. Our advance allows investigators with their current EEG or MEG systems to create a library of brain models tuned to individual subjects' cortical folding in retinotopic maps, and should be applicable to auditory and somatosensory maps. The novel method developed expands EP's ability to study specific brain areas, revitalizing this well-worn technique. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1696-1709, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recent advancements in neuroimaging studies demonstrate clear difference of structural connection profiles in gyral and sulcal areas, suggesting possible functional role difference in these convex and concave cortical regions. To explore and confirm such possible functional difference, we design and apply a powerful deep learning model of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that has been proven to be superior in learning discriminative and meaningful patterns on fMRI. By using the CNN model, gyral and sulcal fMRI signals are learned and predicted, and the prediction performance is adopted to demonstrate the functional difference between gyri and sulci. By using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) fMRI data and macaque brain fMRI data, an average of 83% and 90% classification accuracy has been achieved to separate gyral/sulcal HCP task fMRI signals at the population and individual subject level, respectively; 81% and 86% classification accuracy for resting state fMRI signals at the group and individual subject level, respectively. In addition, 78% classification accuracy has been achieved to separate gyral/sulcal resting state fMRI signals in macaque brains. Importantly, further analysis reveals that the discriminative features that are learned by CNNs to differentiate gyral/sulcal fMRI signals can be meaningfully interpreted, thus unveiling the fundamental functional difference between cortical gyri and sulci. That is, gyri are more global functional integration centers with simpler lower frequency signal components, while sulci are more local processing units with more complex higher frequency signal components.

As the network topology differences induced by a single session of rTMS are less known we undertook this study to ascertain whether the network alterations had a small-world morphology using multi-modal graph theory analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Method: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired in duplicate before (R1) and after (R2) a single session of rTMS in 14 patients with Writer's Cramp (WC). Whole brain neuronal and hemodynamic network connectivity were explored using the graph theory measures and clustering coefficient, path length and small-world index were calculated for EEG and resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). Multi-modal graph theory analysis was used to evaluate the correlation of EEG and fMRI clustering coefficients. Result: A single session of rTMS was found to increase the clustering coefficient and small-worldness significantly in both EEG and fMRI (p < 0.05). Multi-modal graph theory analysis revealed significant modulations in the fronto-parietal regions immediately after rTMS. The rsfMRI revealed additional modulations in several deep brain regions including cerebellum, insula and medial frontal lobe. Conclusion: Multi-modal graph theory analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI can supplement motor physiology methods in understanding the neurobiology of rTMS in vivo. Coinciding evidence from EEG and rsfMRI reports small-world morphology for the acute phase network hyper-connectivity indicating changes ensuing low-frequency rTMS is probably not "noise".

However, the vast majority of studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have reported average differences between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls, which do not permit inferences at the level of individuals. This study was to develop a model for the prediction of PD illness severity ratings from individual fMRI brain scan. The resting-state fMRI scans were obtained from 84 patients with PD and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III) scores were obtained before scanning. The RVR method was used to predict clinical scores (UPDRS-III) from fMRI scans. The application of RVR to whole-brain resting-state fMRI data allowed prediction of UPDRS-III scores with statistically significant accuracy (correlation = 0.35, P-value = 0.001; mean sum of squares = 222.17, P-value = 0.002). This prediction was informed strongly by negative weight areas including prefrontal lobe and medial occipital lobe, and positive weight areas including medial parietal lobe. It was suggested that fMRI scans contained sufficient information about neurobiological change in patients with PD to permit accurate prediction about illness severity, on an individual subject basis. Our results provided preliminary evidence, as proof-of-concept, to support that fMRI might be possible to be a clinically useful quantitative assessment aid in PD at individual level. This may enable clinicians to target those uncooperative patients and machines to replace human for a more efficient use of health care resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we used functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and a whole-brain, searchlight multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to search for areas in which local fMRI patterns could result in identity classification as a function of sensory modality. We found several areas supporting face or voice stimulus classification based on fMRI responses, consistent with previous reports; the classification maps overlapped across modalities in a single area of right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Remarkably, we also found several cortical areas, mostly located along the middle temporal gyrus, in which local fMRI patterns resulted in identity "cross-classification": vocal identity could be classified based on fMRI responses to the faces, or the reverse, or both. These findings are suggestive of a series of cortical identity representations increasingly abstracted from the input modality.

What can we expect this exciting new technique to discover about cortical processing and how can we verify that it is producing an accurate picture of the underlying laminar differences in neural processing? This review will address our knowledge of laminar cortical circuitry gained from electrophysiological studies in macaque monkeys with a focus on the primary visual cortex, as this area has been most often targeted in both laminar electrophysiological and fMRI studies. We will review how recent studies are attempting to verify the accuracy of laminar fMRI by recreating the known laminar profiles of various neural tuning properties. Furthermore, we will examine how feedforward and feedback-related neural processes engage different cortical layers, producing canonical patterns of spiking and synaptic activity as estimated by the analysis of current-source density. These results provide a benchmark for recent studies aiming to examine the profiles of bottom-up and top-down processes with laminar fMRI. Finally, we will highlight particularly useful paradigms and approaches which may help us to understand processing in the different layers of the human cerebral cortex.

Methods: Eleven patients with epilepsy received presurgical language mapping using functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and high-gamma electrocorticography (hgECoG), as well as pre- and postoperative neuropsychological evaluation of language. We constructed 15 (2(4)-1) SVR models by considering the extent of resected language areas identified by all subsets of four modalities as input feature vector and the postoperative language outcome as output. We trained and cross-validated SVR models, and compared the cross-validation (CV) errors of all models for prediction of language outcome. Results: Seven patients had some level of postoperative language decline and two of them had significant postoperative decline in naming. Some parts of language areas identified by four modalities were resected in these patients. We found that an SVR model consisting of fMRI, MEG, and hgECoG provided minimum CV error, although an SVR model consisting of fMRI and MEG was the optimal model that facilitated the best trade-off between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Conclusions: A multimodal SVR can be used to predict the language outcome. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we examine the effect of GLP-1 on simple visual-evoked functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in cortical areas. Methods Lean (n = 10) and nondiabetic obese (n = 10) subjects received exenatide (a GLP-1 agonist) or saline infusion, and fMRI responses to visual stimuli (food and nonfood images) were recorded. We analysed the effect of exenatide on fMRI signals across the cortical surface with special reference to the visual areas. We evaluated the effects of exenatide on the raw fMRI signal and on the fMRI signal change during visual stimulation (vs rest). Results In line with previous studies, we find that exenatide eliminates the preference for food (over nonfood) images present under saline infusion in high-level visual cortex (temporal pole). In addition, we find that exenatide (vs saline) also modulates the response of early visual areas, enhancing responses to both food and nonfood images in several extrastriate occipital areas, similarly in obese and lean participants. Unexpectedly, exenatide increased fMRI raw signals (signal intensity during rest periods without stimulation) in a large occipital region, which were negatively correlated to BMI. Conclusions In both lean and obese individuals, exenatide affects neural processing in visual cortex, both in early visual areas and in higher order areas. This effect may contribute to the known effect of GLP1 analogues on food-related behaviour.

Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the dysfunction of neural processing in acute depression and examined the effects of a 6-week pharmacological intervention. Methods: Sixteen patients with MDD participated in 2 fMRI sessions, and 16 healthy control (HC) subjects participated in 1 fMRI session. During each fMRI session, the participants performed a semantic verbal fluency task. Brain activity during the task was compared between groups (MDD 1st fMRI vs. HC) and times (MDD 1st fMRI vs. 2nd fMRI). Results: Significant brain hypoactivation was observed in MDD patients at the prefrontal, lateral parietal, and limbic regions compared to HC, and MDD patients exhibited hyperactivation at the left precuneus compared to HC. Hypoactivity of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hyperactivity of the precuneus were normalized with treatment. Conclusions: Hypoactivation of the left DLPFC and hyperactivation of the precuneus should be considered as dysregulation of anticorrelated brain networks during a cognitive demanding task. This failure of network regulation may be an important factor in the pathophysiology of MDD. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Setting: Case-control study. Participants: Canadian soldier, Captain Trevor Greene survived a severe open-traumatic brain injury during a 2006 combat tour in Afghanistan. Design: Longitudinal follow-up for more than 6 years. Main Measures: Twelve longitudinal functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) examinations were conducted to investigate lower limb activation changes in association with clinical examination. Trevor Greene's lower limb fMRI activation was compared with control fMRI activation of (1) mental imagery of similar movement and (2) matched control subject data. Results: Trevor Greene's motor recovery and corresponding fMRI activation increased significantly over time (F = 32.54, P <.001). Clinical measures of functional recovery correlated strongly with fMRI motor activation changes (r = 0.81, P =.001). By comparison, while Trevor Greene's mental imagery activated similar motor regions, there was no evidence of fMRI activation change over time. While comparable, control motor activation did not change over time and there was no significant mental imagery activation. Conclusion: Motor function recovery can occur beyond 6 years after severe traumatic brain injury, both in neural plasticity and clinical outcome. This demonstrates that continued benefits in physical function due to rehabilitative efforts can be achieved for many years following injury. The finding challenges current practices and assumptions in rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury.	[D'Arcy, Ryan C.

During a typical fMRI olfactory block-design, one functional "run" refers to a combination of multiple blocks with continuous brain image acquisition. The current study investigated the length of functional runs on odor-induced brain response signals (blood oxygen level dependent [BLOD]) within the primary and key secondary olfactory areas. Methods Twenty-five female adults (age range 19 to 30 years, mean age 25 years) underwent a block-design fMRI measurement with odor stimulation. Twelve participants received the odor stimuli within a short run paradigm (six blocks in each 4-minute run, eight runs in total), and 13 participants received the odor stimulation with a long-run paradigm (12 blocks in each 8-minute run, four runs in total). For each paradigm, two odors (peach and rose) were alternatingly presented between runs. Participants rated odor intensity and pleasantness at the end of each run. Ratings and fMRI data were analyzed for different subsections and compared between groups. Results There was a higher level of brain activation in the insula and orbitofrontal cortex during the short-run paradigm as compared to the long-run paradigm. However, there was no difference for odor intensity or pleasantness ratings. Conclusion The current study suggested the employment of short runs with multiple repetitions for odor stimulation during fMRI research.

Since its advent in 2003 significant progress has been made in fMRI neurofeedback techniques. Specifically, the use of implicit protocols, external rewards, multivariate analysis, and connectivity analysis has allowed neuroscientists to explore a possible causal involvement of modified brain activity in modified behavior. These techniques have also been integrated into groundbreaking new neurofeedback technologies, specifically decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) and functional connectivity-based neurofeedback (FCNef). By modulating neural activity and behavior, DecNef and FCNef have substantially advanced both basic and clinical research.

Many different approaches have been proposed to estimate FC fromfMRI data, whereas many of them rely on an implicit assumption that functional connectivity should be static throughout the fMRI scan session. Recently, the fMRI community has realized the limitation of assuming static connectivity and dynamic approaches are more prominent in the resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis. The sliding window technique has been widely used in many studies to capture network dynamics, but has a number of limitations. In this study, we apply a time-varying graphical lasso (TVGL) model, an extension from the traditional graphical lasso, to address the challenge, which can greatly improve the estimation of FC. The performance of estimating dynamic FC is evaluated with the TVGL through both simulated experiments and real rsfMRI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort project. Improved performance is achieved over the sliding window technique. In particular, group differences and transition behaviors between young adults and children are investigated using the estimated dynamic connectivity networks, which help us to better unveil the mechanisms underlying the evolution of the brain over time.

Emerging methods using functional spectroscopy (fMRS) and diffusion-weighted fMRI suggest that metabolic and structural modifications are also taking place in the activated cells. This paper explores an alternative metabolic imaging approach based on Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) to assess potential metabolic changes induced by neuronal stimulation in rat brains at 17.2T. An optimized CEST-fMRI data acquisition and processing protocol was developed and used to experimentally assess the feasibility of glucoCEST-based fMRI. Images acquired under glucose-sensitizing conditions showed a substantial negative contrast that highlighted the same brain regions as those activated with BOLD-fMRI. We ascribe this novel fMRI contrast to CEST's ability to monitor changes in the local concentration of glucose, a metabolite closely coupled to neuronal activity. Our findings are in good agreement with literature employing other modalities. The use of CEST-based techniques for fMRI is not limited to glucose detection; other metabolic pathways involved in neuronal activation could be potentially probed. Moreover, being non invasive, it is conceivable that the same approach can be used for human studies.

Results: Using a new approach to compute single-subject fMRI reliability in controls, we show that not all tasks are suitable in the clinical context, even if they show meaningful results at the group level. Comparison of the fMRI results from patients to DES showed good correspondence between techniques (odds ratio 36). Conclusion: Providing that validated and reliable fMRI protocols are used, fMRI can accurately delineate eloquent areas, thus providing an aid to medical decision regarding brain tumor surgery.

Comparison of Interleaved silent steady state (ISSS) and conventional imaging in resting-state fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Acoustic scanner noise; Resting-state fMRI; Interleaved silent steady state; Auditory networks	INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; ACOUSTIC NOISE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BACKGROUND-NOISE; DEFAULT-MODE; HUMAN BRAIN; SCANNER; MOTOR; PERCEPTION	Resting-state fMRI studies have become very important in cognitive neuroscience because they are able to identify BOLD fluctuations in brain circuits involved in motor, cognitive, or perceptual processes without the use of an explicit task. Such approaches have been fruitful when applied to various disordered populations, or to children or the elderly. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the consequences of the loud acoustic scanner noise associated with conventional fMRI acquisition, which could be an important confounding factor affecting auditory and/or cognitive networks in resting-state fMRI. Several approaches have been developed to mitigate the effects of acoustic noise on fMRI signals, including sparse sampling protocols and interleaved silent steady state (ISSS) acquisition methods, the latter being used only for task-based fMRI. Here, we developed an ISSS protocol for resting-state fMRI (rs-ISSS) consisting of rapid acquisition of a set of echo planar imaging volumes following each silent period, during which the steady state longitudinal magnetization was maintained with a train of relatively silent slice-selective excitation pulses. We evaluated the test-retest reliability of intensity and spatial extent of connectivity networks of fMRI BOLD signal across three different days for rs-ISSS and compared it with a standard resting-state fMRI (rs-STD). We also compared the strength and distribution of connectivity networks between rs-ISSS and rs-STD. We found that both rs-ISSS and rs-STD showed high reproducibility of fMRI signal across days. In addition, rs-ISSS showed a more robust pattern of functional connectivity within the somatosensory and motor networks, as well as an auditory network compared with rs-STD. An increased connectivity between the default mode network and the language network and with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) network was also found for rs-ISSS compared with rs-STD. Finally, region of interest analysis showed higher interhemispheric connectivity in Heschl's gyri in rs-ISSS compared with rs-STD, with lower variability across days. The present findings suggest that rs-ISSS may be advantageous for detecting network connectivity in a less noisy environment, and that resting-state studies carried out with standard scanning protocols should consider the potential effects of loud noise on the measured networks.

A Bayesian General Linear Modeling Approach to Cortical Surface fMRI Data Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Bayesian smoothing; Brain imaging; Integrated nested Laplace approximation; Spatial statistics; Stochastic partial differential equation	STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; MAPS; PROBABILITY; ACTIVATION; EXTENT	Cortical surface functional magnetic resonance imaging (cs-fMRI) has recently grown in popularity versus traditional volumetric fMRI. In addition to offering better whole-brain visualization, dimension reduction, removal of extraneous tissue types, and improved alignment of cortical areas across subjects, it is also more compatible with common assumptions of Bayesian spatial models. However, as no spatial Bayesian model has been proposed for cs-fMRI data, most analyses continue to employ the classical general linear model (GLM), a "massive univariate" approach. Here, we propose a spatial Bayesian GLM for cs-fMRI, which employs a class of sophisticated spatial processes to model latent activation fields. We make several advances compared with existing spatial Bayesian models for volumetric fMRI. First, we use integrated nested Laplacian approximations, a highly accurate and efficient Bayesian computation technique, rather than variational Bayes. To identify regions of activation, we utilize an excursions set method based on the joint posterior distribution of the latent fields, rather than the marginal distribution at each location. Finally, we propose the first multi-subject spatial Bayesian modeling approach, which addresses a major gap in the existing literature. The methods are very computationally advantageous and are validated through simulation studies and two task fMRI studies from the Human Connectome Project. for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

Following the success, DNNs have been applied to neuroimaging modalities including functional/structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron-emission tomography data. However, no study has explicitly applied DNNs to 3D whole-brain fMRI volumes and thereby extracted hidden volumetric representations of fMRI that are discriminative for a task performed as the fMRI volume was acquired. Our study applied fully connected feedforward DNN to fMRI volumes collected in four sensorimotor tasks (i.e., left-hand clenching, right-hand clenching, auditory attention, and visual stimulus) undertaken by 12 healthy participants. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme, a restricted Boltzmann machine-based deep belief network was pretrained and used to initialize weights of the DNN. The pretrained DNN was fine-tuned while systematically controlling weight-sparsity levels across hidden layers. Optimal weight-sparsity levels were determined from a minimum validation error rate of fMRI volume classification. Minimum error rates (mean standard deviation; %) of 6.9 (+/- 3.8) were obtained from the three-layer DNN with the sparsest condition of weights across the three hidden layers. These error rates were even lower than the error rates from the single-layer network (9.4 +/- 4.6) and the two-layer network (7.4 +/- 4.1). The estimated DNN weights showed spatial patterns that are remarkably task-specific, particularly in the higher layers. The output values of the third hidden layer represented distinct patterns/codes of the 3D whole-brain fMRI volume and encoded the information of the tasks as evaluated from representational similarity analysis. Our reported findings show the ability of the DNN to classify a single fMRI volume based on the extraction of hidden representations of fMRI volumes associated with tasks across multiple hidden layers. Our study may be beneficial to the automatic classification/diagnosis of neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases and prediction of disease severity and recovery in (pre-) clinical settings using fMRI volumes without requiring an estimation of activation patterns or ad hoc statistical evaluation.

Current brain imaging techniques in isolation cannot resolve the brain's spatio-temporal dynamics, because they provide either high spatial or temporal resolution but not both. To overcome this limitation, we developed an integration approach that uses representational similarities to combine measurements of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to yield a spatially and temporally integrated characterization of neuronal activation. Applying this approach to 2 independent MEG-fMRI data sets, we observed that neural activity first emerged in the occipital pole at 50-80 ms, before spreading rapidly and progressively in the anterior direction along the ventral and dorsal visual streams. Further region-of-interest analyses established that dorsal and ventral regions showed MEG-fMRI correspondence in representations later than early visual cortex. Together, these results provide a novel and comprehensive, spatio-temporally resolved view of the rapid neural dynamics during the first few hundred milliseconds of object vision. They further demonstrate the feasibility of spatially unbiased representational similarity-based fusion of MEG and fMRI, promising new insights into how the brain computes complex cognitive functions.

This paper presents new methods for doing so when only a natural language annotation is available as the description of the stimulus. We study fMRI data gathered from subjects watching an episode of BBCs Sherlock (Chen et al., 2017), and learn bidirectional mappings between fMRI responses and natural language representations. By leveraging data from multiple subjects watching the same movie, we were able to perform scene classification with 72% accuracy (random guessing would give 4%) and scene ranking with average rank in the top 4% (random guessing would give 50%). The key ingredients underlying this high level of performance are (a) the use of the Shared Response Model (SRM) and its variant SRM-ICA (Chen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) to aggregate fMRI data from multiple subjects, both of which are shown to be superior to standard PCA in producing low-dimensional representations for the tasks in this paper; (b) a sentence embedding technique adapted from the natural language processing (NLP) literature (Arora et al., 2017) that produces semantic vector representation of the an- notations; (c) using previous time-step information in the featurization of the predictor data. These optimizations in how we featurize the fMRI data and text annotations provide a substantial improvement in classification performance, relative to standard approaches.

In the absence of detectable epileptiform activity, the resting state fMRI may still detect changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal, suggesting intrinsic alterations in the underlying brain physiology. Methods: In this study, we used coefficient of variation (CV) of critically sampled 10 Hz ultra-fast fMRI (magnetoencephalography, MREG) signal to compare physiological variance between healthy controls (n = 10) and patients (n = 10) with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Results: We showed highly significant voxel-level (p < 0.01, TFCE-corrected) increase in the physiological variance in DRE patients. At individual level, the elevations range over three standard deviations (sigma) above the control mean (mu) CVMREG values solely in DRE patients, enabling patient-specific mapping of elevated physiological variance. The most apparent differences in group-level analysis are found on white matter, brainstem, and cerebellum. Respiratory (0.12-0.4 Hz) and very-low-frequency (VLF = 0.009-0.1 Hz) signal variances were most affected. Conclusions: The CVMREG increase was not explained by head motion or physiological cardiorespiratory activity, that is, it seems to be linked to intrinsic physiological pulsations. We suggest that intrinsic brain pulsations play a role in DRE and that critically sampled fMRI may provide a powerful tool for their identification.

Here, we review how functional MRI (fMRI) in particular has contributed to our understanding of speech comprehension, with a focus on studies of intelligibility. We highlight the use of carefully controlled acoustic stimuli to reveal the underlying hierarchical organisation of speech processing systems and cortical (a)symmetries, and discuss the contributions of novel design and analysis techniques to the contextualisation of perisylvian regions within wider speech processing networks. Within this, we outline the methodological challenges of fMRI as a technique for investigating speech and describe the innovations that have overcome or mitigated these difficulties. Focussing on multivariate approaches to fMRI, we highlight how these techniques have allowed both local neural representations and broader scale brain systems to be described.

We aim to resolve these activation changes using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. Methods: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy were used in the analysis. Our method employed the whole scalp EEG data to generate regressors for the analysis of fMRI data using the general linear model. Results: We were able to resolve, with milliseconds temporal resolution, changes in activation patterns involving suspected epileptic foci and other brain regions in the epileptic network during spike and slow wave. Using summary maps (called SSWAS maps) which show the activation frequency of voxels, we found that suspected epileptic foci tend to be significantly active during this interval. SSWAS maps also enabled the detection of the epileptic foci in 4 of 5 patients where the conventional event-timing-based analysis failed to identify. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated the efficacy of the method and the potential application of SSWAS maps to identify epileptic foci.

In humans the brain mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression are poorly understood. Investigating pharmacological influences upon breathing helps us to understand better the brain's respiratory control networks. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) maps neuronal activity in the brain, and is therefore a potentially useful, noninvasive technique to investigate the functional neuroanatomy of respiratory control in humans. Contrast in FMRI is derived from the vascular response to brain activity (neurovascular coupling). Therefore, FMRI studies of the neuronal effects of opioids are rendered more complex by the non-neuronal effects of opioids including those on systemic physiology, cerebral blood flow, and direct effects on the cerebral vasculature such as altered vascular reactivity. Here we review our series of studies that dissect the vascular and neuronal breathing-related effects of opioids in the brain. These methodological considerations have enabled successful FMRI studies revealing the brain networks responsible for opioid effects upon respiratory awareness. Similar considerations would be necessary for FMRI studies in hypoxia or in disease states that affect the physiological state of the brain.	[Pattinson, Kyle T.

However, the functional relevance of fMRIa observed in these regions is unclear as of today. Therefore, here we aimed at investigating the relationship between fMRIa and face perception ability by measuring in the same human participants both the repetition-induced reduction of fMRI responses and identity discrimination performance outside the scanner for upright and inverted face stimuli. In the correlation analysis, the behavioral and fMRI results for the inverted faces were used as covariates to control for the individual differences in overall object perception ability and basic visual feature adaptation processes, respectively. The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the participants' identity discrimination performance and the strength of fMRIa in the core face processing network, but not in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Furthermore, we found a strong correlation of the fMRIa between OFA and FFA and also between OFA and EBA, but not between FFA and EBA. These findings suggest that there is a face-selective component of the repetition-induced reduction of fMRI responses within the core face processing network, which reflects functionally relevant adaptation processes involved in face identity perception.

As fMRI measures the hemodynamic response, the resulting activation maps do not perfectly reflect the underlying neural activity. The purpose of this work was to design a data-driven model to improve the spatial accuracy of fMRI maps in the rat olfactory bulb. This system is an ideal choice for this investigation since the bulb circuit is well characterized, allowing for an accurate definition of activity patterns in order to train the model. We generated models for both cerebral blood volume weighted (CBVw) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data. The results indicate that the spatial accuracy of the activation maps is either significantly improved or at worst not significantly different when using the learned models compared to a conventional general linear model approach, particularly for BOLD images and activity patterns involving deep layers of the bulb. Furthermore, the activation maps computed by CBVw and BOLD data show increased agreement when using the learned models, lending more confidence to their accuracy. The models presented here could have an immediate impact on studies of the olfactory bulb, but perhaps more importantly, demonstrate the potential for similar flexible, data-driven models to improve the quality of activation maps calculated using fMRI data.

In this paper, we propose a classifier ensemble for multiclass classification in fMRI analysis, exploiting the fact that specific neighboring voxels can contain spatial pattern information. The proposed method converts the multiclass classification to a pairwise classifier ensemble, and each pairwise classifier consists of multiple sub-classifiers using an adaptive feature set for each class-pair. Simulated and real fMRI data were used to verify the proposed method. Intra- and inter-subject analyses were performed to compare the proposed method with several well-known classifiers, including single and ensemble classifiers. The comparison results showed that the proposed method can be generally applied to multiclass classification in both simulations and real fMRI analyses.

Despite extensive investigations conducted to examine the neural sources of N170, there are two issues in prior literature: (a) few studies used individualized anatomy as head model for the cortical source analysis of the N170, and (b) the relationship between the N170 and face-selective regions from fMRI studies is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by presenting pictures of faces and houses to the same group of healthy adults and recording structural MRI, fMRI, and high-density ERPs in separate sessions. Source analysis based on the participant's anatomy showed that the middle and posterior fusiform gyri were the primary neural sources for the face-sensitive aspects of the N170. Source analysis based on regions of interest from the fMRI revealed that the fMRI-defined fusiform face area was the major contributor to the N170. The current study suggests that the fusiform gyrus is a major neural contributor to the N170 ERP component and provides further insights about the spatiotemporal characteristics of face processing.

Meta-analyses of fMRI studies of executive functions (EFs) show that ADHD patients have cognitive-domain dissociated complex multisystem impairments in several right and left hemispheric dorsal, ventral and medial fronto-cingulo-striato-thalamic and fronto-parieto-cerebellar networks that mediate cognitive control, attention, timing and working memory (WM). There is furthermore emerging evidence for abnormalities in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal and limbic areas that mediate motivation and emotion control. In addition, poor deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) suggests an abnormal interrelationship between hypo-engaged task-positive and poorly "switched off" hyper-engaged task-negative networks, both of which are related to impaired cognition. Translational cognitive neuroscience in ADHD is still in its infancy. Pattern recognition analyses have attempted to provide diagnostic classification of ADHD using fMRI data with respectable classification accuracies of over 80%. Necessary replication studies, however, are still outstanding. Brain stimulation has been tested in heterogeneously designed, small numbered proof of concept studies targeting key frontal functional impairments in ADHD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears to be promising to improve ADHD symptoms and cognitive functions based on some studies, but larger clinical trials of repeated stimulation with and without cognitive training are needed to test clinical efficacy and potential costs on non-targeted functions. Only three studies have piloted NF of fMRI- based frontal dysfunctions in ADHD using fMRI or near-infrared spectroscopy, with the two larger ones finding some improvements in cognition and symptoms, which, however, were not superior to the active control conditions, suggesting potential placebo effects. Neurotherapeutics seems attractive for ADHD due to their safety and potential longer-term neuroplastic effects, which drugs cannot offer. However, they need to be thoroughly tested for short- and longer-term clinical and cognitive efficacy and their potential for individualized treatment.

However, fMRI data only indirectly reflects the neuronal laminar profile due to a bias to ascending and pial veins inherent in gradient-and spinecho BOLD fMRI. In addition, accurate delineation of the cortical depths is difficult, due to the relatively large voxel sizes and lack of sufficient tissue contrast in the functional images. In conventional depth-dependent fMRI studies, anatomical and functional data are acquired with different image read-out modules, the fMRI data are distortion-corrected and vascular biases are accounted for by subtracting the depth-dependent activation profiles of different stimulus conditions. In this study, using high-resolution gradient-echo fMRI data (0.7 mm isotropic) of the human visual cortex, we propose instead, that depth-dependent functional information is best preserved if data analysis is performed in the original functional data space. To achieve this, we acquired anatomical images with high tissue contrast and similar distortion to the functional images using multiple inversion-recovery time EPI, thereby eliminating the need to un-distort the fMRI data. We demonstrate higher spatial accuracy for the cortical layer definitions of this approach as compared to the more conventional approach using MP2RAGE anatomy. In addition, we provide theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that vascular biases can be better accounted for using division instead of subtraction of the depth-dependent profiles. Finally, we show that the hemodynamic response of grey matter has relatively stronger post-stimulus undershoot than the pial vein voxels. In summary, we show that the choice of fMRI data acquisition and processing can impact observable differences in the cortical depth profiles and present evidence that cortical depth-dependent modulation of the BOLD signal can be resolved using gradient-echo imaging.

Predicting eye movement patterns from fMRI responses to natural scenes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; GEOMETRICALLY ACCURATE; VISUAL-ATTENTION; REPRESENTATIONS; MODELS; IMAGES; INFORMATION; PARIETAL; PRIORITY	Eye tracking has long been used to measure overt spatial attention, and computational models of spatial attention reliably predict eye movements to natural images. However, researchers lack techniques to noninvasively access spatial representations in the human brain that guide eye movements. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to predict eye movement patterns from reconstructed spatial representations evoked by natural scenes. First, we reconstruct fixation maps to directly predict eye movement patterns from fMRI activity. Next, we use a model-based decoding pipeline that aligns fMRI activity to deep convolutional neural network activity to reconstruct spatial priority maps and predict eye movements in a zero-shot fashion. We predict human eye movement patterns from fMRI responses to natural scenes, provide evidence that visual representations of scenes and objects map onto neural representations that predict eye movements, and find a novel three-way link between brain activity, deep neural network models, and behavior.

Methods: The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was designed to explore participants' reward-related decision-making in relation to selections during risky behaviors. Twenty adults with ADHD and 20 HCs were enrolled. fMRI with a modified IGT was performed. Results: The adults with ADHD showed a poorer performance in terms of avoidance during risky behaviors. The fMRI results indicated that the adults with ADHD had significantly lower orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation. A positive correlation between performance in the IGT and brain activation in the OFC was detected. Conclusions: The results suggested that the adults with ADHD exhibited abnormal OFC responses during decision-making. Significance: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use fMRI to collect brain activation data while performing the IGT in adults with ADHD. Our findings suggest that deficits in reward processing in ADHD are still present during adulthood. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Both resting state functional connectivity and task-based brain activity abnormalities are reported in atypical parkinsonisms relative to healthy controls and Parkinson's disease patients. Functional alterations were observed earlier than structural damage and may help to make early diagnosis. The chapter also examines the few longitudinal evidence on fMRI changes in patients with these conditions. The potential use of fMRI techniques in aiding the differential diagnosis, accurately measuring disease progression and assessing the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions is discussed.

Anticipatory stress associated with functional magnetic resonance imaging: Implications for psychosocial stress research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; Anticipatory stress; Cortisol Psychosocial stress; Skin conductance	CORTISOL REACTIVITY; RESPONSES; BRAIN; SYSTEM; CLAUSTROPHOBIA; ACTIVATION; INCREASES; AXIS; NOREPINEPHRINE; DETERMINANTS	Stress tasks performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) elicit a relatively small cortisol response compared to stress tasks completed in a traditional behavioral laboratory, which may be due to apprehension of fMRI that elicits an anticipatory stress response. The present study investigated whether anticipatory stress is greater prior to research completed in an MRI environment than in a traditional behavioral laboratory. Anticipatory stress (indexed by cortisol) was greater prior to testing in the MRI environment than traditional behavioral laboratory. Furthermore, anticipation of fMRI elicited a cortisol response commensurate with the response to the stress task in the behavioral laboratory. However, in the MRI environment, post-stress cortisol was significantly lower than baseline cortisol. Taken together, these findings suggest the stress elicited by anticipation of fMRI may lead to acute elevations in cortisol prior to scanning, which may in turn disrupt the cortisol response to stress tasks performed during scanning.

In spite of this, advanced analytic methods continue to be published that reinforce a historic bias against white matter activation by using it as a nuisance regressor. It is important that contemporary analyses overcome this blind spot in whole brain functional imaging, both to ensure that newly developed noise regression techniques are accurate, and to ensure that white matter, a vital and understudied part of the brain, is not ignored in functional neuroimaging studies.

Functional Subpopulations of Neurons in a Macaque Face Patch Revealed by Single-Unit fMRI Mapping	NEURON			English	Article							NATURAL VISION; VISUAL-CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; MONKEY; BRAIN; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; OBJECTS; HUMANS; SYSTEM	Neurons within fMRI-defined face patches of the macaque brain exhibit shared categorical responses to flashed images but diverge in their responses under more natural viewing conditions. Here we investigate functional diversity among neurons in the anterior fundus (AF) face patch, combining whole-brain fMRI with longitudinal single-unit recordings in a local population (<1 mm(3)). For each cell, we computed a whole-brain correlation map based on its shared time course with voxels throughout the brain during naturalistic movie viewing. Based on this mapping, neighboring neurons showed markedly different affiliation with distant visually responsive areas and fell coarsely into subpopulations. Of these, only one subpopulation (similar to 16% of neurons) yielded similar correlation maps to the local fMRI signal. The results employ the readout of large-scale fMRI networks and, by indicating multiple functional domains within a single voxel, present a new view of functional diversity within a local neural population.

However, the classification performance is restricted by the high dimensional property and noises of the fMRI data. In this paper, a new feature selection method (named as "NMI-F") was proposed by sequentially combining the normalized mutual information (NMI) and fisher discriminant ratio. In NMI-F, the normalized mutual information was firstly used to evaluate the relationships between features, and fisher discriminant ratio was then applied to calculate the importance of each feature involved. Two fMRI datasets (task-related and resting state) were used to test the proposed method. It was found that classification base on the NMI-F method could differentiate the brain cognitive and disease states effectively, and the proposed NMI-F method was prior to the other related methods. The current results also have implications to the future studies.

We demonstrate with two validation analyses that these new data support modeling specific properties of the complex natural stimulus, as well as a substantial within-subject BOLD response congruency in brain areas related to the processing of auditory inputs, speech, and narrative when compared to the existing fMRI data for audio-only stimulation. In addition, we provide participants' eye gaze location as recorded simultaneously with fMRI, and an additional sample of 15 control participants whose eye gaze trajectories for the entire movie were recorded in a lab setting-to enable studies on attentional processes and comparative investigations on the potential impact of the stimulation setting on these processes.

Voxel selection plays an important role in MVPA studies not only because it can improve decoding accuracy but also because it is useful for understanding brain functions. There are many voxel selection methods that have been proposed in fMRI literature. However, most of these methods either overlook the structure information of fMRI data or require additional crossvalidation procedures to determine the hyperparameters of the models. In the present work, we proposed a voxel selection method for binary brain decoding called group sparse Bayesian logistic regression (GSBLR). This method utilizes the group sparse property of fMRI data by using a grouped automatic relevance determination (GARD) as a prior for model parameters. All the parameters in the GSBLR can be estimated automatically, thereby avoiding additional cross-validation. Experimental results based on two publicly available fMRI datasets and simulated datasets demonstrate that GSBLR achieved better classification accuracies and yielded more stable solutions than several state-of-the-art methods.

Here we demonstrate that MRI-guided FUS is capable of exciting precise targets within areas 3a/3b in the monkey brain, causing downstream activations in off-target somatosensory and associated brain regions which are simultaneously detected by functional MRI. The similarity between natural tactile stimulation-and FUS-evoked fMRI activation patterns suggests that FUS likely can excite populations of neurons and produce associated spiking activities that may be subsequently transmitted to other functionally related touch regions. The across-region differences in fMRI signal changes relative to area 3a/3b between tactile and FUS conditions also indicate that FUS modulated the tactile network differently. The significantly faster rising (>1 sec) fMRI signals elicited by direct FUS stimulation at the targeted cortical region suggest that a different neural hemodynamic coupling mechanism may be involved in generating fMRI signals. This is the first demonstration of imaging neural excitation effects of FUS with BOLD fMRI on a specific functional circuit in non-human primates.	[Yang, Pai-Feng; Phipps, M.

Despite this, rs-fMRI signals are easily contaminated by artifacts arising from movement of the head during data collection. The artifacts can be problematic even for motions on the millimeter scale, with complex spatiotemporal properties that can lead to substantial errors in functional connectivity estimates. Effective correction methods must be employed, therefore, to distinguish true functional networks from motion-related noise. Research over the last three decades has produced numerous correction methods, many of which must be applied in combination to achieve satisfactory data quality. Subject instruction, training, and mild restraints are helpful at the outset, but usually insufficient. Improvements come from applying multiple motion correction algorithms retrospectively after rs-fMRI data are collected, although residual artifacts can still remain in cases of elevated motion, which are especially prevalent in patient populations. Although not commonly adopted at present, "real-time" correction methods are emerging that can be combined with retrospective methods and that promise better correction and increased rs-fMRI signal sensitivity. While the search for the ideal motion correction protocol continues, rs-fMRI research will benefit from good disclosure practices, such as: (1) reporting motion-related quality control metrics to provide better comparison between studies; and (2) including motion covariates in group-level analyses to limit the extent of motion-related confounds when studying group differences.

Confirmation of resting-state BOLD fluctuations in the human brainstem and spinal cord after identification and removal of physiological noise	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						resting state; spinal cord; physiological noise; human; fMRI	OF-THE-ART; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL FUNCTION; FMRI; PAIN; NETWORKS; INJURY; MOTION; NORMALIZATION; SUMMATION	PurposeResting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been used to investigate networks within the cortex, but its use in the brainstem (BS) and spinal cord (SC) has been limited. This region presents challenges for fMRI, partly because of sources of physiological noise. This study aims to quantify noise contributions to rs-fMRI, and to obtain evidence of resting-state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations. MethodsResting-state-fMRI data were obtained from the BS/SC in 16 participants, at 3 Tesla, with T-2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo imaging. The peripheral pulse, respiration, and expired CO2 were recorded continuously. Physiological noise was modeled from these recordings, movement parameters, and white matter regions. Model fits were then subtracted from the data. BOLD contributions were then investigated through connectivity. ResultsBulk motion was the largest contributor to the signal variance (19% of the total), followed by cardiac-related motion (14%), nonspecific signal variations detected in white matter (10%), respiratory-related motion (2.6%), and end-tidal CO2 variations (0.7%). After noise was removed, significant left-right connectivity was detected in the SC dorsal horns and ventral horns. ConclusionsResting-state BOLD fluctuations are demonstrated in the SC, as are the dominant noise contributions. These findings are an essential step toward establishing rs-fMRI in the BS/SC.

Different techniques like electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have traditionally been used to find biomarkers for autism, but there have been very few attempts for a combined or multimodal approach of EEG, fMRI, and DTI to understand the neurobiological basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we explore how the structural brain network correlate with the functional brain network, such that the information encompassed by these two could be uncovered only by using the latter. In this paper, source localization from EEG using independent component analysis and dipole fitting has been applied first, followed by selecting those dipoles that are closest to the active regions identified with fMRI. This allows translating the high temporal resolution of EEG to estimate time varying connectivity at the spatial source level. Our analysis shows that the estimated functional connectivity between two active regions can be correlated with the physical properties of the structure obtained from DTI analysis. This constitutes a first step toward opening the possibility of using pervasive EEG to monitor the long-term impact of ASD treatment without the need for frequent expensive fMRI or DTI investigations.

Review of functional MRI in HIV: effects of aging and medication	JOURNAL OF NEUROVIROLOGY			English	Review						HAND; fMRI; BOLD; Systematic review	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; COMBINATION ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE RESERVE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; MENTAL ROTATION; INFECTION; MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT	HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a frequently occurring comorbidity of HIV infection. Evidence suggests this condition starts subclinical before a progression to a symptomatic stage. Blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has shown to be a sensitive tool to detect abnormal brain function in an early stage and might therefore be useful to evaluate the effect of HIV infection on brain function. An extensive literature search was performed in June 2015. Eligibility criteria for included studies were as follows: (1) conducting with HIV-positive patients, (2) using BOLD fMRI, and (3) including a HIV-negative control group. A total of 19 studies were included in the review including 931 participants. Differences in activation between HIV-positive and -negative participants were found when testing multiple domains, i.e., attention, (working) memory, and especially executive functioning. Overall, HIV-positive patients showed hyperactivation in task-related brain regions despite equal performances as controls. Task performance was degraded only for the most complex tasks. A few studies investigated the effect of aging on fMRI, and most of them found no interaction with HIV infection. Only three studies evaluated the effect of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on functional data suggesting an increase in activation with the use of cART. fMRI is a sensitive instrument to detect subtle cognitive changes in HIV patients. Open questions remain regarding the effects of cART on fMRI and the effects of aging on fMRI.	[Hakkers, C. S.; Arends, J. E.; Barth, R. E.; Hoepelman, A. I.

On the Stability of BOLD fMRI Correlations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						BOLD fMRI; dynamics; functional connectivity; nonstationarity; resting state	DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; RESTING-STATE FMRI; HEAD MOTION; FLUCTUATIONS; ORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY; TRACKING; CORTEX; SLEEP	Measurement of correlations between brain regions (functional connectivity) using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the functional organization of the brain. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity has emerged as a major topic in the resting-state BOLD fMRI literature. Here, using simulations and multiple sets of empirical observations, we confirm that imposed task states can alter the correlation structure of BOLD activity. However, we find that observations of "dynamic" BOLD correlations during the resting state are largely explained by sampling variability. Beyond sampling variability, the largest part of observed "dynamics" during rest is attributable to head motion. An additional component of dynamic variability during rest is attributable to fluctuating sleep state. Thus, aside from the preceding explanatory factors, a single correlation structure-as opposed to a sequence of distinct correlation structures-may adequately describe the resting state as measured by BOLD fMRI. These results suggest that resting-state BOLD correlations do not primarily reflect moment-to-moment changes in cognitive content. Rather, resting-state BOLD correlations may predominantly reflect processes concerned with the maintenance of the long-term stability of the brain's functional organization.

Biophysically based method to deconvolve spatiotemporal neurovascular signals from fMRI data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						fMRI; BOLD; Modeling; Spatiotemporal; Deconvolution; Neurovascular	CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE FUNCTION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; BALLOON MODEL; BOLD FMRI; FLOW; DYNAMICS; AREAS; NOISE	Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is commonly used to infer hemodynamic changes in the brain after increased neural activity, measuring the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. An important challenge in the analyses of fMRI data is to develop methods that can accurately deconvolve the BOLD signal to extract the driving neural activity and the underlying cerebrovascular effects. New method: A biophysically based method is developed, which combines an extensively verified physiological hemodynamic model with a Wiener filter, to deconvolve the BOLD signal. Results: The method is able to simultaneously obtain spatiotemporal images of underlying neurovascular signals, including neural activity, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration. The method is tested on simulated data and applied to various experimental data to demonstrate its stability, accuracy, and utility. Comparison with existing methods: The resulting profiles of the deconvolved signals are consistent with measurements reported in the literature, obtained via multiple neuroimaging modalities. Conclusions: The method provides new testable predictions of the spatiotemporal relations of the deconvolved signals for future studies. This demonstrates the ability of the method to quantify and analyze the neurovascular mechanisms that underlie fMRI, thereby expanding its potential uses.	[Pang, J. C.; Aquino, K. M.; Robinson, P.

Accounting for Non-Gaussian Sources of Spatial Correlation in Parametric Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Paradigms I: Revisiting Cluster-Based Inferences	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						cluster-based family-wise error rate calculation; fMRI parametric methods; general linear model residuals; Monte Carlo simulation; principal component analysis; spatial autocorrelation function; thresholding	GULF-WAR; FMRI; ACTIVATION; CONNECTIVITY; MOTION; EXTENT; BOLD; STABILITY; VETERANS; SIGNAL	In a recent study, Eklund et al. employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data as a surrogate for null functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets and posited that cluster-wise family-wise error (FWE) rate-corrected inferences made by using parametric statistical methods in fMRI studies over the past two decades may have been invalid, particularly for cluster defining thresholds less stringent than p < 0.001; this was principally because the spatial autocorrelation functions (sACF) of fMRI data had been modeled incorrectly to follow a Gaussian form, whereas empirical data suggested otherwise. Here, we show that accounting for non-Gaussian signal components such as those arising from resting-state neural activity as well as physiological responses and motion artifacts in the null fMRI datasets yields first-and second-level general linear model analysis residuals with nearly uniform and Gaussian sACF. Further comparison with nonparametric permutation tests indicates that cluster-based FWE corrected inferences made with Gaussian spatial noise approximations are valid.

As the foundation of fMRI, the underlying neural basis of the BOLD signal has been extensively studied, but the detailed mechanism remains elusive, particularly during the resting state. To examine the neurovascular coupling, it is important to simultaneously record neural and vascular signals. Here we developed a novel setup of camera based, scalable simultaneous calcium fiber photometry and fMRI in rats. Using this setup, we recorded calcium signals of superior colliculus (SC) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and fMRI simultaneously during visual stimulation and the resting state. Our results revealed robust, region-specific coupling between calcium and BOLD signals in the task state and weaker, whole brain correlation in the resting state. Interestingly, the spatial specificity of such correlation in the resting state was improved upon regression of white matter, ventricle signals and global signals in fMRI data. Overall, our results suggest differential coupling of calcium and BOLD signals for subcortical regions between evoked and resting states, and the coupling relationship in the resting state was related with resting state BOLD preprocessing strategies.

To address this limitation, we developed a fast, robust fMRI odor paradigm that is appropriate for all ages and levels of cognitive functioning. To test this approach, thirty-four typically developing children aged 7-12 underwent fMRI during brief, repeated exposure to phenylethyl alcohol, a flower-scented odor. Prior to fMRI scanning, olfactory testing (odor detection and identification) was conducted. During fMRI stimulus presentation, odorant release was synchronized to each participant's inspiratory phase to ensure participants were inhaling during the odorant exposure. Between group differences and correlations between activation and odor detection threshold scores were tested using the FMRIB Software Library. Results demonstrated that our 2-min paradigm significantly activated primary and secondary olfactory regions. In addition, a significant relationship between odor detection threshold and higher activation in the right amygdala and lower activation in the left frontal, insular, occipital, and cerebellar regions was observed, suggesting that this approach is sensitive to individual differences in olfactory processing. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of studying olfactory function in children using brain imaging techniques.

Measuring eye states in functional MRI	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Eye movements; Eye closure; Vision; EPI; fMRI	MOVEMENTS; CLOSURE; BRAIN; HUMANS; FMRI; REGISTRATION; MECHANISMS; BLINKING; IMAGES; AREAS	Background: In many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, experimental design often depends on the eye state (i.e., whether the participants had their eyes open or closed). Closed eyes during an fMRI is the general convention, particularly when patients are in a resting-state, but the eye state is difficult to verify. Although knowledge of the impact of the eye state on brain activity is steadily growing, only a few research groups have implemented standardized procedures to monitor eye movements and eye state. These procedures involve advanced methods that are costly (e.g., fMRI-compatible cameras) and often time-consuming (e.g., EEG/EOG). Results: We present a simple method that distinguishes open from closed eyes utilizing functional MR images alone. The utility of this method was demonstrated on fMRI data from 14 healthy subjects who had to open and close their eyes according to a predetermined protocol (3.0 T MRI scanner, EPI sequence with 3 x 3 x 3 mm voxels, TR 2.52 s). Conclusion: The method presented herein is capable of extracting the movement direction of the eyes. All described methods are applicable for pre- and post-normalized MR images and are freely available through a MATLAB toolbox.

However, how intrinsic brain activity (iBA) changes over a short time remains unknown. To uncover the brain dynamics' theoretic underpinning, electrophysiological relevance, and neuromodulation, we identified iBA dynamics on simulated data, electroencephalogram-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) fMRI data using sliding-window analysis. The temporal variability (dynamics) of iBA were quantified using the variance of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) over time. We first used simulated fMRI data to examine the effects of various parameters including window length, and step size on dynamic ALFF. Second, using EEG-fMRI data, we found that the heteromodal association cortex had the most variable dynamics while the limbic regions had the least, consistent with previous findings. In addition, the temporal variability of dynamic ALFF depended on EEG power fluctuations. Moreover, using rTMS fMRI data, we found that the temporal variability of dynamic ALFF could be modulated by rTMS. Taken together, these results provide evidence about the theory, relevance, and adjustability of iBA dynamics.

We have developed a biophysically-based model (named FIACH: Functional Image Artefact Correction Heuristic) which extends current retrospective noise control methods in fMRI. FIACH can be applied to both General Linear Model (GLM) and resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) studies. FIACH is a two-step procedure involving the identification and correction of non-physiological large amplitude temporal signal changes and spatial regions of high temporal instability. We have demonstrated its efficacy in a sample of 42 healthy children while performing language tasks that include overt speech with known activations. We demonstrate large improvements in sensitivity when FIACH is compared with current methods of retrospective correction. FIACH reduces the confounding effects of noise and increases the study's power by explaining significant variance that is not contained within the commonly used motion parameters. The method is particularly useful in detecting activations in inferior temporal regions which have proven problematic for fMRI. We have shown greater reproducibility and robustness of fMRI responses using FIACH in the context of task induced motion. In a clinical setting this will translate to increasing the reliability and sensitivity of fMRI used for the identification of language lateralisation and eloquent cortex. FIACH can benefit studies of cognitive development in young children, patient populations and older adults. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pharmacological treatment development for AUD is a top research priority, and many studies are being conducted to evaluate potential AUD treatments. Understanding the brain circuitry impacted by addiction is crucial for the development of efficacious pharmacological interventions. These neuroadaptations can be probed noninvasively using functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI). fMRI may be an effective tool to identify biomarkers for AUD pharmacotherapies, evaluating changes associated with pharmacological treatment. Thus, the present qualitative review of the literature focuses on the role of fMRI as a tool for medication development for AUD. The aim of this review was to assemble research across a range of fMRI paradigms to study the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of adult AUD. First, we present a qualitative review of fMRI AUD pharmacotherapy studies, differentiating studies based on their dosing regimen. Second, we provide recommendations for the field to improve the use of fMRI as a biomarker for AUD pharmacotherapy.

The relationship between oscillatory EEG activity and the laminar-specific BOLD signal	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cortical layers; oscillations; high-resolution fMRI; EEG	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; GAMMA; FREQUENCY; FMRI; ATTENTION; BRAIN; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION	Electrophysiological recordings in animals have indicated that visual cortex gamma-band oscillatory activity is predominantly observed in superficial cortical layers, whereas alpha- and beta-band activity is stronger in deep layers. These rhythms, as well as the different cortical layers, have also been closely related to feedforward and feedback streams of information. Recently, it has become possible to measure laminar activity in humans with high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). In this study, we investigated whether these different frequency bands show a differential relation with the laminar-resolved blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal by combining data from simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI from the early visual cortex. Our visual attention paradigm allowed us to investigate how variations in strength over trials and variations in the attention effect over subjects relate to each other in both modalities. We demonstrate that gamma-band EEG power correlates positively with the superficial layers' BOLD signal and that beta-power is negatively correlated to deep layer BOLD and alpha-power to both deep and superficial layer BOLD. These results provide a neurophysiological basis for human laminar fMRI and link human EEG and high-resolution fMRI to systems-level neuroscience in animals.

The physiological mechanisms underlying the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect are complex and preclude a straightforward interpretation of the signal. However, by employing appropriate calibration of the BOLD signal, quantitative measurements can be made of important physiological parameters including the absolute rate of cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption or oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction (OEF). The ability to map such fundamental parameters has the potential to greatly expand the utility of fMRI and to broaden its scope of application in clinical research and clinical practice. In this review article we discuss some of the practical issues related to the calibrated-fMRI approach to the measurement of CMRO2. We give an overview of the necessary precautions to ensure high quality data acquisition, and explore some of the pitfalls and challenges that must be considered as it is applied and interpreted in a widening array of diseases and research questions.

State-or-the-art machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed to take on this diagnostic task. In this study, we employed Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) classifiers to discriminate patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from healthy controls based on their cognitive skills. Further, we adopted a Learning with privileged information approach to combine cognitive and fMRI data for the classification task. The resulting classifier operates solely on the cognitive data while it incorporates the fMRI data as privileged information (PI) during training. This novel classifier is of practical use as the collection of brain imaging data is not always possible with patients and older participants. MCI patients and healthy age-matched controls were trained to extract structure from temporal sequences. We ask whether machine learning classifiers can be used to discriminate patients from controls and whether differences between these groups relate to individual cognitive profiles. To this end, we tested participants in four cognitive tasks: working memory, cognitive inhibition, divided attention, and selective attention. We also collected fMRI data before and after training on a probabilistic sequence learning task and extracted fMRI responses and connectivity as features for machine learning classifiers. Our results show that the PI guided GMLVQ classifiers outperform the baseline classifier that only used the cognitive data. In addition, we found that for the baseline classifier, divided attention is the only relevant cognitive feature. When PI was incorporated, divided attention remained the most relevant feature while cognitive inhibition became also relevant for the task. Interestingly, this analysis for the fMRI GMLVQ classifier suggests that (1) when overall fMRI signal is used as inputs to the classifier, the post-training session is most relevant; and (2) when the graph feature reflecting underlying spatiotemporal fMRI pattern is used, the pre-training session is most relevant. Taken together these results suggest that brain connectivity before training and overall fMRI signal after training are both diagnostic of cognitive skills in MCI.

Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability/replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability<0.3 for between-subject sex differences,<0.5 for within-subject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g.,<80 [40 per group]) not only minimized power (sensitivity<2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect true effects (PPV<0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.

This article introduces a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (Locally Linear Embedding) to extract informative measures of the underlying neuronal activity from BOLD time-series. The method is validated using the Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) accuracy of classifying psychiatric diagnoses using resting-state and task-related fMRI. Methods: Locally Linear Embedding of BOLD time-series (into each voxel's respective tensor) was used to optimise feature selection. This uses Gauss' Principle of Least Constraint to conserve quantities over both space and time. This conservation was assessed using LOOCV to greedily select time points in an incremental fashion on training data that was categorised in terms of psychiatric diagnoses. Findings: The embedded fMRI gave highly diagnostic performances (> 80%) on eleven publicly-available datasets containing healthy controls and patients with either Schizophrenia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Furthermore, unlike the original fMRI data before or after using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for artefact reduction, the embedded fMRI furnished significantly better than chance classification (defined as the majority class proportion) on ten of eleven datasets. Interpretation: Locally Linear Embedding appears to be a useful feature extraction procedure that retains important information about patterns of brain activity distinguishing among psychiatric cohorts.

J	Branco, P; Seixas, D; Castro, SL				Branco, Paulo; Seixas, Daniela; Castro, Sao Luis			Temporal reliability of ultra-high field resting-state MRI for single-subject sensorimotor and language mapping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Ultra-high resolution; Resting-state fMRI; Language network; Sensorimotor network; Reliability; Independent component analysis	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; MOTION ARTIFACT; DEFAULT-MODE; ICA-AROMA; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; NETWORK; ROBUST; TASK	Resting-state fMRI is a well-suited technique to map functional networks in the brain because unlike task-based approaches it requires little collaboration from subjects. This is especially relevant in clinical settings where a number of subjects cannot comply with task demands. Previous studies using conventional scanner fields have shown that resting-state fMRI is able to map functional networks in single subjects, albeit with moderate temporal reliability. Ultra-high resolution (7 T) imaging provides higher signal-to-noise ratio and better spatial resolution and is thus well suited to assess the temporal reliability of mapping results, and to determine if resting-state fMRI can be applied in clinical decision making including preoperative planning. We used resting-state fMRI at ultra-high resolution to examine whether the sensorimotor and language networks are reliable over time - same session and one week after. Resting-state networks were identified for all subjects and sessions with good accuracy. Both networks were well delimited within classical regions of interest. Mapping was temporally reliable at short and medium time-scales as demonstrated by high values of overlap in the same session and one week after for both networks. Results were stable independently of data quality metrics and physiological variables. Taken together, these findings provide strong support for the suitability of ultra-high field resting-state fMRI mapping at the single-subject level.

The present systematic review was conducted to explore prevalence of different language paradigms utilised in conjunction with fMRI approaches for pre-operative mapping, with the aim of assessing their effectiveness and suitability. Methods A systematic literature search of brain tumours in the context of fMRI methods applied to pre-operative mapping for language functional areas was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus electronic database following PRISMA guidelines. The article search was conducted between the earliest record and March 1, 2019. References and citations were checked in Google Scholar database. Results Twenty-nine independent studies were identified, comprising 1031 adult participants with 976 patients characterised with different types and sizes of brain tumours, and the remaining 55 being healthy controls. These studies evaluated functional language areas in patients with brain tumours prior to surgical interventions using language-based fMRI. Results demonstrated that 86% of the studies used a Word Generation Task (WGT) to evoke functional language areas during pre-operative mapping. Fifty-seven percent of the studies that used language-based paradigms in conjunction with fMRI as a pre-operative mapping tool were in agreement with intra-operative results of language localization. Conclusions WGT was most commonly utilised and is proposed as a suitable and useful technique for a language-based paradigm fMRI for pre-operative mapping. However, based on available evidence, WGT alone is not sufficient. We propose a combination and convergence paradigms for a more sensitive and specific map of language function for pre-operative mapping. A standard guideline for clinical applications should be established.

This technique made it possible to assess changes in metabolic activity in clinical applications, such as the study of severe brain injury and disorders of consciousness. Objective: We assessed the possibility of creating functional MRI activity maps, which could estimate the relative levels of activity in FDG-PET cerebral metabolic maps. If no metabolic absolute measures can be extracted, our approach may still be of clinical use in centers without access to FDG-PET. It also overcomes the problem of recognizing individual networks of independent component selection in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state analysis. Methods: We extracted resting state fMRI functional connectivity maps using independent component analysis and combined only components of neuronal origin. To assess neuronality of components a classification based on support vector machine (SVM) was used. We compared the generated maps with the FDG-PET maps in 16 healthy controls, 11 vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients and four locked-in patients. Results: The results show a significant similarity with rho = 0.75 +/- 0.05 for healthy controls and rho = 0.58 +/- 0.09 for vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients between the FDG-PET and the fMRI based maps. FDG-PET, fMRI neuronal maps, and the conjunction analysis show decreases in frontoparietal and medial regions in vegetative patients with respect to controls. Subsequent analysis in locked-in syndrome patients produced also consistent maps with healthy controls. Conclusions: The constructed resting state fMRI functional connectivity map points toward the possibility for fMRI resting state to estimate relative levels of activity in a metabolic map.

Group-level comparison analysis is common in the human brain fMRI analysis. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for BSS (BSS-CCA) relies on the basis that all meaningful real signals are auto-correlated compared with white noise, which should generally not be considered. By merely requiring that the second-order statistic be zero, BSS-CCA is more relaxed than independent component analysis (ICA), which demands mutual statistics of all orders to be zero. Based on spatial BSS-CCA, we propose an approach termed group BSS-CCA for the analysis of multi-subject fMRI data. In terms of the simulated situation, in which "sources" were partially overlapping in space, we determined that identification using group BSS-CCA was more efficient than that using group ICA. The results from a real data experiment revealed that the proposed group BSS-CCA approach was effective for extracting functional brain networks that were functionally distinct and spatially overlapping from the fMRI data of the human brain.

Functional MRI of Handwriting Tasks: A Study of Healthy Young Adults Interacting with a Novel Touch-Sensitive Tablet	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						handwriting; neuropsychological tests; fMRI; pen-and-paper test; visual feedback of hand position; ecological validity	INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; VISUAL FEEDBACK; PURE AGRAPHIA; FMRI; BRAIN; MOTOR; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENTS	Handwriting is a complex human activity that engages a blend of cognitive and visual motor skills. Current understanding of the neural correlates of handwriting has largely come from lesion studies of patients with impaired handwriting. Task-based fMRI studies would be useful to supplement this work. To address concerns over ecological validity, previously we developed a fMRI-compatible, computerized tablet system for writing and drawing including visual feedback of hand position and an augmented reality display. The purpose of the present work is to use the tablet system in proof-of-concept to characterize brain activity associated with clinically relevant handwriting tasks, originally developed to characterize handwriting impairments in Alzheimer's disease patients. As a prelude to undertaking fMRI studies of patients, imaging was performed of twelve young healthy subjects who copied sentences, phone numbers, and grocery lists using the fMRI-compatible tablet. Activation maps for all handwriting tasks consisted of a distributed network of regions in reasonable agreement with previous studies of handwriting performance. In addition, differences in brain activity were observed between the test subcomponents consistent with different demands of neural processing for successful task performance, as identified by investigating three quantitative behavioral metrics (writing speed, stylus contact force and stylus in air time). This study provides baseline behavioral and brain activity results for fMRI studies that adopt this handwriting test to characterize patients with brain impairments.

Cortical and Subcortical Coordination of Visual Spatial Attention Revealed by Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Recording	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attentional control; EEG; fMRI; pulvinar; visual cortex	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PULVINAR; BRAIN; CORTEX; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION; MODULATION	Visual spatial attention has been studied in humans with both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) individually. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of each of these methods used alone, our understanding of the systems-level mechanisms underlying attentional control remains limited. Here, we examined trial-to-trial covariations of concurrently recorded EEG and fMRI in a cued visual spatial attention task in humans, which allowed delineation of both the generators and modulators of the cue-triggered event-related oscillatory brain activity underlying attentional control function. The fMRI activity in visual cortical regions contralateral to the cued direction of attention covaried positively with occipital gamma-band EEG, consistent with activation of cortical regions representing attended locations in space. In contrast, fMRI activity in ipsilateral visual cortical regions covaried inversely with occipital alpha-band oscillations, consistent with attention-related suppression of the irrelevant hemispace. Moreover, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus covaried with both of these spatially specific, attention-related, oscillatory EEG modulations. Because the pulvinar's neuroanatomical geometry makes it unlikely to be a direct generator of the scalp-recorded EEG, these covariational patterns appear to reflect the pulvinar's role as a regulatory control structure, sending spatially specific signals to modulate visual cortex excitability proactively. Together, these combined EEG/fMRI results illuminate the dynamically interacting cortical and subcortical processes underlying spatial attention, providing important insight not realizable using either method alone.

The introduction of hybrid PET/MRI systems further enables the simultaneous acquisition of these parameters. Although a recently developed method offers the quantification of task-specific changes in glucose metabolism (CMRG1u) in a single measurement, direct comparison of the two imaging modalities is still difficult because of the different temporal resolutions. Thus, we optimized the protocol and systematically assessed shortened task durations of WET to approach that of fMRI. Methods: Twenty healthy subjects (9 male) underwent one measurement on a hybrid PET/MRI scanner. During the scan, tasks were completed in four blocks for fMRI (4 x 30 s blocks) and WET: participants tapped the fingers of their right hand repeatedly to the thumb while watching videos of landscapes. For WET, subjects were randomly assigned to groups of n = 5 with varying task durations of 10, 5, 2 and 1 min, where task durations were kept constant within a measurement. The radiolabeled glucose analogue [F-18]FDG was administered as 20% bolus plus constant infusion. The bolus increases the signal-to-noise ratio and leaves sufficient activity to detect task-related effects but poses additional challenges due to a discontinuity in the tracer uptake. First, three approaches to remove task effects from the baseline term were evaluated: (1) multimodal, based on the individual fMRI analysis, (2) atlas-based by removing presumably activated regions and (3) model-based by fitting the baseline with exponential functions. Second, we investigated the need to capture the arterial input function peak with automatic blood sampling for the quantification of CMRG1u. We finally compared the task-specific activation obtained from WET and fMRI qualitatively and statistically. Results: CMRGlu quantified only with manual arterial samples showed a strong correlation to that obtained with automatic sampling (r = 0.9996). The multimodal baseline definition was superior to the other tested approaches in terms of residuals (p < 0.001). Significant task-specific changes in CMRGlu were found in the primary visual and motor cortices (t(M1) = 18.7 and t(V1) = 18.3). Significant changes of fMRI activation were found in the same areas (t(M1) = 16.0 and t(V1)= 17.6) but additionally in the supplementary motor area, ipsilateral motor cortex and secondary visual cortex. Post-hoc t-tests showed strongest effects for task durations of 5 and 2 min (all p < 0.05 FWE corrected), whereas 1 min exhibited pronounced unspecific activation. Percent signal change (PSC) was higher for CMRGlu (similar to 18%-27%) compared to fMRI (similar to 2%). No significant association between PSC of taskspecific CMRGlu and fMRI was found (r = 0.26). Conclusion: Using a bolus plus constant infusion protocol, the necessary task duration for reliable quantification of task-specific CMRGlu could be reduced to 5 and 2 min, therefore, approaching that of fMRI. Important for valid quantification is a correct baseline definition, which was ideal when task-relevant voxels were determined with fMRI. The absence of a correlation and the different activation pattern between WET and fMRI suggest that glucose metabolism and oxygen demand capture complementary aspects of energy demands.

Yet, there are remarkable individual differences in brain health and memory performance among OA. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is one individual difference factor that may attenuate brain aging, and thereby contribute to enhanced source memory in OA. To examine this possibility, 26 OA and 31 YA completed a treadmill-based exercise test to evaluate CRF (peak VO2) and fMRI to examine brain activation during a face-name associative encoding task. Our results indicated that in OA, peak VO2 was positively associated with fMRI activity during associative encoding in multiple regions including bilateral prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, bilateral thalamus and left hippocampus. Next, a conjunction analysis was conducted to assess whether CRF influenced age-related differences in fMRI activation. We classified OA as high or low CRF and compared their activation to YA. High fit OA (HFOA) showed fMRI activation more similar to YA than low fit OA (LFOA) (i.e., reduced age-related differences) in multiple regions including thalamus, posterior and prefrontal cortex. Conversely, in other regions, primarily in prefrontal cortex, HFOA, but not LFOA, demonstrated greater activation than YA (i.e., increased age-related differences). Further, fMRI activity in these brain regions was positively associated with source memory among OA, with a mediation model demonstrating that associative encoding activation in medial frontal cortex indirectly influenced the relationship between peak VO2 and subsequent source memory performance. These results indicate that CRF may contribute to neuroplasticity among OA, reducing age-related differences in some brain regions, consistent with the brain maintenance hypothesis, but accentuating age-differences in other regions, consistent with the brain compensation hypothesis.

However, spatial ICA usually performs better than temporal ICA with regard to the stability and accuracy of functional connectivity detection, and temporal ICA is often not feasible when it is applied to the analysis of real fMRI data of the whole brain because of the excessive spatial dimensions. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we propose a sub-packet constrained temporal ICA (SCTICA) method to take advantage of the a priori information using a multi-objective optimization framework with the Newton iterative algorithm. Moreover, a splitting strategy is presented to improve the feasibility of the temporal ICA for whole brain fMRI data analysis. The experimental results of real data show that the splitting strategy improved the ability of the temporal ICA to analyze whole brain fMRI data. Furthermore, the experimental results also demonstrated that the proposed SCTICA method can not only improve the stability of the temporal ICA, but can also improve the functional connectivity detection ability compared with the classical ICA and ICA with a priori information methods. In brief, the proposed SCTICA method overcomes the problem that prevents temporal ICA from being applied to fMRI data of the whole brain, and the functional connectivity detection performance is greatly improved compared with that of traditional methods.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neuroinflammatory and demyelinating disease, modifies the normal connectivity among different brain regions involved in specific functions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), based on local changes in oxygen level as a response to the increase in neural activity, provides an approach to neural connectivity and brain dynamics which give us an overview on visual, motor and cognitive dysfunction and their mechanisms. Development. An advanced search was performed using PubMed. Terms 'fMRI', 'visual', 'motor', 'cognitive' and 'multiple sclerosis' included in title and abstract were considered. We focus on original articles available in English. Articles were included based on their abstracts, looking for those potentially useful for understanding functional changes in MS. An important amount of studies have used fMRI as a complementary tool in the study of MS and clinically relevant alterations compromising visual, motor and cognitive domains. Since the earliest stages of the disease, local activity, and global neural dynamics appear to be compromised. Even when functional performance is still preserved, a different recruitment of neural resources arises as a compensatory response to disconnection observed in the disease. Conclusions. The main findings of fMRI applied to MS are strongly related to the demyelinating nature of the disease and provide an adequate insight into the mechanisms that underlie functional alterations reported in this disease. fMRI also appears to be useful for studying disease evolution and response to treatment in MS and other disorders.

The response to colour in the human visual cortex: the fMRI approach	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Review							RED-GREEN; STRIATE CORTEX; ADAPTATION; SELECTIVITY; ORIENTATION; CONTRAST; REPRESENTATIONS; ORGANIZATION; SEGREGATION; SENSITIVITY	fMRI has been an important tool for understanding the functional organization of the human visual cortex for colour vision. Here I focus on three distinct approaches used in fMRI, each addressing a different question. Univariate measurements of BOLD amplitude responses have localized the areas of the human visual cortex with high colour responses. fMRI adaptation has the potential to define the selectivity (tuning) of the neural responses in these areas to colour in relation to achromatic responses or within the colour space. Finally, recent multivariate approaches specifically analyze the distributed nature of the responses to colour across voxel populations and have made important in-roads into understanding how colour is represented at voxel and subvoxel scales.

We review the current role of WT and fMRI in the presurgical assessment of TLE, and how novel surgical techniques might improve cognitive outcomes.Recent FindingsfMRI's ability to predict global amnesia has not been assessed. Although WT can produce false-positive results, it is still indicated in patients at risk for developing global amnesia: those with significant bilateral or contralateral memory deficits. In the current review, WT exhibited no added value, beyond preclinical data, for predicting material-specific memory impairment, whereas fMRI was reliable for either verbal or non-verbal memory decline. Abnormal functional connectivity on resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) between the posterior cingulate and the hippocampus may be a predictor of postsurgical memory outcomes. Restricted resections to the pathogenic tissue, stereotactic laser, radiosurgery, and SEEG-guided thermos-coagulation were associated with better cognitive outcome.SummaryfMRI should be used routinely in the presurgical workup of TLE to predict verbal and/or non-verbal memory decline, whereas WT may be indicated when there is a high risk of postsurgical global amnesia. Rs-fMRI is a promising tool for the presurgical workup of TLE, and more restricted resections are recommended to enhance cognitive outcomes.

New method: A novel application of the robust unsupervised learning approach is proposed in the current study. Robust growing neural gas (RGNG) algorithm was fed into fMRI data and compared with growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm, which has not been used for this purpose or any other medical application. Learning algorithms proposed in the current study are fed with real and free auditory fMRI datasets. Results: The fMRI result obtained by running RGNG was within the expected outcome and is similar to those found with the hypothesis method in detecting active areas within the expected auditory cortices. Comparison with existing method(s): The fMRI application of the presented RGNG approach is clearly superior to other approaches in terms of its insensitivity to different initializations and the presence of outliers, as well as its ability to determine the actual number of clusters successfully, as indicated by its performance measured by minimum description length (MDL) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Conclusions: The RGNG can detect the active zones in the brain, analyze brain function, and determine the optimal number of underlying clusters in fMRI datasets. This algorithm can define the positions of the center of an output cluster corresponding to the minimal MDL value. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The image contrast in fMRI relies on the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, which indirectly reflects neural activity through neurovascular coupling. Because the mechanism that links the BOLD signal to neural activities involves multiple complicated processes, where neural activity, regional metabolism, hemodynamics, and the BOLD signal are all inter-connected, understanding the quantitative relationship between the BOLD signal and the underlying neural activities is crucial for interpreting fMRI data. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) and fMRI recordings provide a method to study neurovascular coupling. There were a few studies that have shown non-linearities in stimulus related responses, but whether there is any non-linearity in LFP-BOLD relationship at rest has not been specifically quantified. In this study, we analyzed the simultaneous LFP and resting state-fMRI data acquired from rodents, and found that the relationship between LFP and BOLD is non-linear under isoflurane (ISO) anesthesia, but linear under dexmedetomidine (DMED) anesthesia. Subsequent analysis suggests that such non-linearity may come from the non-Gaussian distribution of LFP power and switching from LFP power to LFP amplitude can alleviate the problem to a degree. We also confirmed that, despite the non-linearity in the mean LFP-BOLD curve, the Pearson correlation between the two signals is relatively unaffected.

Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with MTLE who underwent a complete presurgical evaluation were included. All patients underwent fMRI memory study and complete neuropsychological assessment. Lesions consisted in hippocampal sclerosis in 18 patients (12 right and 6 left), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) in 5 cases (4 right, 1 left), epidermoid cyst in one patient (right). Two patients had no lesion (2 left). Results: Nineteen patients (73%) underwent surgery. The other seven patients (27%) declined surgery, mainly because of the risk of memory deficit. The fMRI procedure correctly predicted both verbal and nonverbal memory postoperative outcome in 13 of the patients (72%), failed to predict a postoperative memory worsening in only two patients (12%), and predicted worsening in three patients (17%) that remained stable (versus 44%, 39%, and 17% with the sole neuropsychological testing). The reliability of the fMRI procedure was not influenced by the type of lesion, the side of the epileptic focus, or the type of preoperative memory profile (typical or atypical). Significance: Appearing as a valuable clinical tool to predict postoperative memory outcome, fMRI may add information over and above other available tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The degree to which neural circuits involved in this process behave differently during word recognition as compared to object recognition is not known. Evidence from neuroimaging (fMRI) suggests that interhemispheric transfer during word viewing converges in the left hemisphere, in two distinct brain areas, an "occipital word form area" (OWFA) and a more anterior occipitotemporal "visual word form area" (VWFA). We used a novel fMRI half-field repetition technique to test whether or not these areas also integrate nonverbal hemifield-split string stimuli of similar visual complexity. We found that the fMRI responses of both the OWFA and VWFA while viewing nonverbal stimuli were strikingly different than those measured during word viewing, especially with respect to half-stimulus changes restricted to a single hemifield. We conclude that normal reading relies on left-lateralized neural mechanisms, which integrate hemifield-split visual information for words but not for nonverbal stimuli.

We showed previously that 18 ADHD adolescents over 11 runs of 8.5 min of real-time functional magnetic resonance neurofeedback of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) progressively increased activation in 2 regions of the rIFC which was associated with clinical symptom improvement. In this study, we used functional connectivity analyses to investigate whether fMRI-Neurofeedback of rIFC resulted in dynamic functional connectivity changes in underlying neural networks. Whole-brain seed-based functional connectivity analyses were conducted using the two clusters showing progressively increased activation in rIFC as seed regions to test for changes in functional connectivity before and after 11 fMRI-Neurofeedback runs. Furthermore, we tested whether the resulting functional connectivity changes were associated with clinical symptom improvements and whether they were specific to fMRI-Neurofeedback of rIFC when compared to a control group who had to self-regulate another region. rIFC showed increased positive functional connectivity after relative to before fMRI-Neurofeedback with dorsal caudate and anterior cingulate and increased negative functional connectivity with regions of the default mode network (DMN) such as posterior cingulate and precuneus. Furthermore, the functional connectivity changes were correlated with clinical improvements and the functional connectivity and correlation findings were specific to the rIFC-Neurofeedback group. The findings show for the first time that fMRI-Neurofeedback of a typically dysfunctional frontal region in ADHD adolescents leads to strengthening within fronto-cingulo-striatal networks and to weakening of functional connectivity with posterior DMN regions and that this may be underlying clinical improvement.

Real-Time Motor Cortex Mapping for the Safe Resection of Glioma: An Intraoperative Resting-State fMRI Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HAND AREA; LANGUAGE; LOCALIZATION; SURGERY; IMPACT; EXTENT; MRI	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state functional MR imaging has been used for motor mapping in presurgical planning but never used intraoperatively. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of applying intraoperative resting-state functional MR imaging for the safe resection of gliomas using real-time motor cortex mapping during an operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using interventional MR imaging, we conducted preoperative and intraoperative resting-state intrinsic functional connectivity analyses of the motor cortex in 30 patients with brain tumors. Factors that may influence intraoperative imaging quality, including anesthesia type (general or awake anesthesia) and tumor cavity (filled with normal saline or not), were studied to investigate image quality. Additionally, direct cortical stimulation was used to validate the accuracy of intraoperative resting-state fMRI in mapping the motor cortex. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative resting-state fMRI scans were acquired for all patients. Fourteen patients who successfully completed both sufficient intraoperative resting-state fMRI and direct cortical stimulation were used for further analysis of sensitivity and specificity. Compared with those subjected to direct cortical stimulation, the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative resting-state fMRI in localizing the motor area were 61.7% and 93.7%, respectively. The image quality of intraoperative resting-state fMRI was better when the tumor cavity was filled with normal saline (P = .049). However, no significant difference between the anesthesia types was observed (P = .102). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using intraoperative resting-state fMRI for real-time localization of functional areas during a neurologic operation. The findings suggest that using intraoperative resting-state fMRI can avoid the risk of intraoperative seizures due to direct cortical stimulation and may provide neurosurgeons with valuable information to facilitate the safe resection of gliomas.

Arcuate Fasciculus Asymmetry Has a Hand in Language Function but not Handedness	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						handedness; tractography; arcuate fasciculus; fMRI; structural asymmetry; language lateralization; lateralization index	DIFFUSION TENSOR SPECTROSCOPY; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; PLANUM TEMPORALE; FAMILIAL SINISTRALITY; FIBER DENSITY; LATERALIZATION; MRI; FMRI; TRACTOGRAPHY	The importance of relationships between handedness, language lateralization and localization, and white matter tracts for language performance is unclear. The goal of the study was to investigate these relationships by examining arcuate fasciculus ( AF) structural asymmetry ( DTI) and functional asymmetry ( fMRI) in language circuits, handedness, and linguistic performance. A large sample of righthanded ( n=158) and atypical-handed ( n=82) healthy adults underwent DTI at 3 T to assess number of streamlines and fractional anisotropy ( FA) of the AF, and language fMRI. Language functions were assessed using standard tests of vocabulary, naming, verbal fluency, and complex ideation. Laterality indices ( LIs) illustrated degree of asymmetry and lateralization patterns for the AF ( streamlines and FA) and verb generation fMRI. Both handedness groups showed leftward lateralization bias for streamline and fMRI LIs and symmetry for FA LI. The proportion of subjects with left, right, or symmetric lateralization were similar between groups if based on AF LIs, but differed if based on fMRI LIs ( p=0.0016). Degree of right-handedness was not associated with AF lateralization, but was associated with fMRI language lateralization ( p=0.0014). FA LI was not associated with performance on language assessments, but streamline LI was associated with better vocabulary and complex ideation performance in atypical-handed subjects ( p=0.022 and p=0.0098, respectively), and better semantic fluency in right-handed subjects ( p=0.047); however, these did not survive multiple comparisons correction. We provide evidence that AF asymmetry is independent of hand preference, and while degree of right-handedness is associated with hemispheric language lateralization, the majority of atypical-handed individuals are left-lateralized for language.

We have methods, each of which has significant limitations but provide often complimentary information. Clearly, there are many questions that need to be answered about fMRI, which unlike other methods, allows us to study the human brain. However, there are also extraordinary accomplishments or demonstration of the feasibility of reaching new and previously unexpected scales of function in the human brain. This article reviews some of the work we have pursued, often with extensive collaborations with other co-workers, towards understanding the underlying mechanisms of the methodology, defining its limitations, and developing solutions to advance it. No doubt, our knowledge of human brain function has vastly expanded since the introduction of fMRI. However, methods and instrumentation in this dynamic field have evolved to a state that discoveries about the human brain based on fMRI principles, together with information garnered at a much finer spatial and temporal scale through other methods, are poised to significantly accelerate in the next decade.

However, in brain imaging (e.g., fMRI), the direct application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to decoding subject states or perception from imaging data seems impractical given the scarcity of available data. New method: In this work we propose a robust method to transfer information from deep learning (DL) features to brain fMRI data with the goal of decoding. By adopting Reduced Rank Regression with Ridge Regularisation we establish a multivariate link between imaging data and the fully connected layer (fc7) of a CNN. We exploit the reconstructed fc7 features by performing an object image classification task on two datasets: one of the largest fMRI databases, taken from different scanners from more than two hundred subjects watching different movie clips, and another with fMRI data taken while watching static images. Results: The fc7 features could be significantly reconstructed from the imaging data, and led to significant decoding performance. Comparison with existing methods: The decoding based on reconstructed fc7 outperformed the decoding based on imaging data alone. Conclusion: In this work we show how to improve fMRI-based decoding benefiting from the mapping between functional data and CNN features. The potential advantage of the proposed method is twofold: the extraction of stimuli representations by means of an automatic procedure (unsupervised) and the embedding of high-dimensional neuroimaging data onto a space designed for visual object discrimination, leading to a more manageable space from dimensionality point of view.

Acquisition of sensorimotor fMRI under general anaesthesia: Assessment of feasibility, the BOLD response and clinical utility	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						fMRI; Anaesthesia; Brain tumour; Intra-operative; Neurosurgery	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SEVOFLURANE ANESTHESIA; ANESTHETIZED PATIENTS; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; PROPOFOL; CONTRAST; MOTOR; STIMULATION	We evaluated whether task-related fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) activation could be acquired under conventional anaesthesia at a depth enabling neurosurgery in five patients with supratentorial gliomas. Within a 1.5 T MRI operating room immediately prior to neurosurgery, a passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm was performed on each hand with the patients awake, and then immediately after the induction and maintenance of combined sevoflurane and propofol general anaesthesia. The depth of surgical anaesthesia was measured and confirmed with an EEG-derived technique, the Bispectral Index (BIS). The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia were determined. The fMRI data were assessed by three fMRI expert observers who rated each activation map for somatotopy and usefulness for radiological neurosurgical guidance. The mean magnitudes of the task-related BOLD response under a BIS measured depth of surgical general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of the respective awake values. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia ranged from 7% to 83% compared to the awake state. Despite these reductions, somatotopic BOLD activation was observed in the sensorimotor cortex in all ten data acquisitions surpassing statistical thresholds of at least p < 0.001(uncorr). All ten fMRI activation datasets were scored to be useful for radiological neurosurgical guidance. Passive task-related sensorimotor fMRI acquired in neurosurgical patients under multi-pharmacological general anaesthesia is reproducible and yields clinically useful activation maps. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and its potential value if applied infra-operatively. Additionally these methods may enable fMRI investigations in patients unable to perform or lie still for awake paradigms, such as young children, claustrophobic patients and those with movement disorders.

Using concurrent EEG and fMRI to probe the state of the brain in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Concurrent EEG plus fMRI; Perception; N100; P200; Schizophrenia; Avolition/apathy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; DEFAULT MODE; NEUROMAGNETIC RESPONSES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RESTING-STATE; COMPONENT; HALLUCINATIONS; PERCEPTION	Perceptional abnormalities in schizophrenia are associated with hallucinations and delusions, but alsowith negative symptoms and poor functional outcome. Perception can be studied using EEG-derived event related potentials (ERPs). Because of their excellent temporal resolution, ERPs have been used to ask when perception is affected by schizophrenia. Because of its excellent spatial resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to ask where in the brain these effects are seen. We acquired EEG and fMRI data simultaneously to explore when and where auditory perception is affected by schizophrenia. Thirty schizophrenia (SZ) patients and 23 healthy comparison subjects (HC) listened to 1000 Hz tones occurring about every second. We used joint independent components analysis (jICA) to combine EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) and fMRI responses to tones. Five ERP-fMRI joint independent components (JIC) were extracted. The "N100" JIC had temporal weights during N100 (peaking at 100 ms post-tone onset) and fMRI spatial weights in superior and middle temporal gyri (STG/MTG); however, it did not differ between groups. The "P200" JIC had temporal weights during P200 and positive fMRI spatial weights in STG/MTG and frontal areas, and negative spatial weights in the nodes of the default mode network (DMN) and visual cortex. Groups differed on the "P200" JIC: SZ had smaller "P200" JIC, especially those with more severe avolition/apathy. This is consistent with negative symptoms being related to perceptual deficits, and suggests patients with avolition/apathy may allocate too few resources to processing external auditory events and too many to processing internal events.

Moment-to-Moment BOLD Signal Variability Reflects Regional Changes in Neural Flexibility across the Lifespan	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BOLD variability; lifespan development; mean square successive difference; resting-state fMRI	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FMRI; AGE; CONNECTIVITY; CONNECTOME; MODEL	Variability of neuronal responses is thought to underlie flexible and optimal brain function. Because previous work investigating BOLD signal variability has been conducted within task-based fMRI contexts on adults and older individuals, very little is currently known regarding regional changes in spontaneous BOLD signal variability in the human brain across the lifespan. The current study used resting-state fMRI data from a large sample of male and female human participants covering a wide age range (6-85 years) across two different fMRI acquisition parameters (TR = 0.645 and 1.4 s). Variability in brain regions including a key node of the salience network (anterior insula) increased linearly across the lifespan across datasets. In contrast, variability in most other large-scale networks decreased linearly over the lifespan. These results demonstrate unique lifespan trajectories of BOLD variability related to specific regions of the brain and add to a growing literature demonstrating the importance of identifying normative trajectories of functional brain maturation.

Neurophysiologic effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) via electrical stimulation of the tragus: A concurrent taVNS/fMRI study and review	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Review						Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS); fMRI; Ear stimulation; Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN-STEM; MOOD; EFFICACY; EAR; REPRESENTATION; ABNORMALITIES	Background: Electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) via transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) may influence afferent vagal networks. There have been 5 prior taVNS/fMRI studies, with inconsistent findings due to variability in stimulation targets and parameters. Objective: We developed a taVNS/fMRI system to enable concurrent electrical stimulation and fMRI acquisition to compare the effects of taVNS in relation to control stimulation. Methods: We enrolled 17 healthy adults in this single-blind, crossover taVNS/fMRI trial. Based on parameters shown to affect heart rate in healthy volunteers, participants received either left tragus (active) or earlobe (control) stimulation at 500 ms 25 HZ for 60 s (repeated 3 times over 6min). Whole brain fMRI analysis was performed exploring the effect of: active stimulation, control stimulation, and the comparison. Region of interest analysis of the midbrain and brainstem was also conducted. Results: Active stimulation produced significant increased BOLD signal in the contralateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral insula, frontal cortex, right operculum, and left cerebellum. Control stimulation produced BOLD signal activation in the contralateral postcentral gyrus. In the active vs. control contrast, tragus stimulation produced significantly greater BOLD increases in the right caudate, bilateral anterior cingulate, cerebellum, left prefrontal cortex, and mid-cingulate. Conclusion: Stimulation of the tragus activates the cerebral afferents of the vagal pathway and combined with our review of the literature suggest that taVNS is a promising form of VNS. Future taVNS/fMRI studies should systematically explore various parameters and alternative stimulation targets aimed to optimize this novel form of neuromodulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Corticospinal tract atrophy and motor fMRI predict motor preservation after functional cerebral hemispherectomy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						hemispherectomy; reorganization; functional MRI; fMRI; diffusion tensor imaging; DTI; epilepsy	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; SENSORIMOTOR FUNCTION; REORGANIZATION; EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; STROKE; DTI; OUTCOMES; CORTEX; HAND	OBJECTIVE The potential loss of motor function after cerebral hemispherectomy is a common cause of anguish for patients, their families, and their physicians. The deficits these patients face are individually unique, but as a whole they provide a framework to understand the mechanisms underlying cortical reorganization of motor function. This study investigated whether preoperative functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could predict the postoperative preservation of hand motor function. METHODS Thirteen independent reviewers analyzed sensorimotor fMRI and colored fractional anisotropy (CoFA)-DTI maps in 25 patients undergoing functional hemispherectomy for treatment of intractable seizures. Pre- and postoperative gross hand motor function were categorized and correlated with fMRI and DTI findings, specifically, abnormally located motor activation on fMRI and corticospinal tract atrophy on DTI. RESULTS Normal sensorimotor cortical activation on preoperative fMRI was significantly associated with severe decline in postoperative motor function, demonstrating 92.9% sensitivity (95% CI 0.661-0.998) and 100% specificity (95% CI 0.715-1.00). Bilaterally robust, symmetric corticospinal tracts on CoFA-DTI maps were significantly associated with severe postoperative motor decline, demonstrating 85.7% sensitivity (95% CI 0.572-0.982) and 100% specificity (95% CI 0.715-1.00). Interpreting the fMR images, the reviewers achieved a Fleiss' kappa coefficient (kappa) for interrater agreement of kappa = 0.69, indicating good agreement (p < 0.01). When interpreting the CoFA-DTI maps, the reviewers achieved kappa = 0.64, again indicating good agreement (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Functional hemispherectomy offers a high potential for seizure freedom without debilitating functional deficits in certain instances. Patients likely to retain preoperative motor function can be identified prior to hemispherectomy, where fMRI or DTI suggests that cortical reorganization of motor function has occurred prior to the operation.

Individual differences in self-reported reward-approach tendencies relate to resting-state and reward-task-based fMRI measures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Behavioral activation; Reward sensitivity; Striatum; fMRI; Resting state	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SENSITIVITY; ACTIVATION; PUNISHMENT; RESPONSES; DISORDER; RISK	In this study, we investigated neural responses during resting-state and reward-task-based fMRI and how these related to individual differences in self-reported reward sensitivity. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 191 college students, and 60 of these individuals further finished a reward-related fMRI task. Self-reported reward-approach tendencies were assessed using the behavioral activation scale. Behavioral activation scale scores were positively correlated with brain activations in the striatum bilaterally during reward processing. During rest, behavioral activation scale scores were positively correlated with functional connectivity between the left and right striatum and with functional connectivity between the right striatum and right middle frontal gyrus. Positive correlations were found between task-based striatal activations and the functional connectivity between the left and right striatum at rest. These results suggest a relationship between striatal task-based reward-related activations and resting connectivity strengths that relate to individual differences in reward approach tendencies.

However, no review has yet examined its role in depression by integrating conceptual and quantitative findings across functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG methodologies. The authors quantified these effects, with an emphasis on development. Method: A total of 38 fMRI and 12 EEG studies were entered into fMRI and EEG meta-analyses. fMRI studies primarily examined reward anticipation and reward feedback. These were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. EEG studies involved mainly the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential, and these studies were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis of the association between FRN and depression. Results: Analysis of fMRI studies revealed significantly reduced striatal activation in depressed compared with healthy individuals during reward feedback. When region-of-interest analyses were included, reduced activation was also observed in reward anticipation, an effect that was stronger in individuals under age 18. FRN was also significantly reduced in depression, with pronounced effects in individuals under age 18. In longitudinal studies, reduced striatal activation in fMRI and blunted FRN in EEG were found to precede the onset of depression in adolescents. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings show consistent neural aberrations during reward processing in depression, namely, reduced striatal signal during feedback and blunted FRN. These aberrations may underlie the pathogenesis of depression and have important implications for development of new treatments.

Given their pronounced differences in temporal and spatial statistics, the combination of EEG and fMRI data is however methodologically challenging. Here, we propose a novel screening approach that relies on a Cross Multivariate Correlation Coefficient (xMCC) framework. This approach accomplishes three tasks: (1) It provides a measure for testing multivariate correlation and multivariate uncorrelation of the two modalities; (2) it provides criterion for the selection of EEG features; (3) it performs a screening of relevant EEG information by grouping the EEG channels into clusters to improve efficiency and to reduce computational load when searching for the best predictors of the BOLD signal. The present report applies this approach to a data set with concurrent recordings of steady-state-visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) and fMRI, recorded while observers viewed phase-reversing Gabor patches. We test the hypothesis that fluctuations in visuo-cortical mass potentials systematically covary with BOLD fluctuations not only in visual cortical, but also in anterior temporal and prefrontal areas. Results supported the hypothesis and showed that the xMCC-based analysis provides straightforward identification of neurophysiological plausible brain regions with EEG-fMRI covariance. Furthermore xMCC converged with other extant methods for EEG-fMRI analysis.

Simultaneously measuring neural activity using electrophysiology with fMRI has been highly valuable in elucidating the neural basis of the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal. However, this approach is also technically challenging due to the electromagnetic interference that is observed in electrophysiological recordings during MRI scanning. New method: Recording optical correlates of neural activity, such as calcium signals, avoids this issue, and has opened a new avenue to simultaneously acquire neural and BOLD signals. Results: The present study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously and repeatedly acquiring calcium and BOLD signals in animals using a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6. This approach was validated with a visual stimulation experiment, during which robust increases of both calcium and BOLD signals in the superior colliculus were observed. In addition, repeated measurement in the same animal demonstrated reproducible calcium and BOLD responses to the same stimuli. Comparison with existing method(s): Taken together, simultaneous GCaMP6-based fiber photometry and fMRI recording presents a novel, artifact-free approach to simultaneously measuring neural and fMRI signals. Furthermore, given the cell-type specificity of GCaMP6, this approach has the potential to mechanistically dissect the contributions of individual neuron populations to BOLD signal, and ultimately reveal its underlying neural mechanisms. Conclusions: The current study established the method for simultaneous GCaMP6-based fiber photometry and fMRI in rats. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This could improve the applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla (7T-fMRI), such as neurosurgical planning and Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, increasing the spatial and temporal resolution will both lead to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) losses due to decreased net magnetization per voxel and T-1-relaxation effect, respectively. This could potentially offset the SNR efficiency gains made with increasing temporal resolution. We investigated the effects of varying spatial and temporal resolution on fMRI sensitivity measures and their implications on fMRI-based BCI simulations. We compared temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), observed percent signal change (%Delta S), volumes of significant activation, Z-scores and decoding performance of linear classifiers commonly used in BCIs across a range of spatial and temporal resolution images acquired during an ankle-tapping task. Our results revealed an average increase of 22% in %Delta S (p=0.006) and 9% in decoding performance (p=0.015) with temporal resolution only at the highest spatial resolution of 1.5x1.5x1.5 mm(3), despite a 29% decrease in tSNR (p < 0.001) and plateaued Z-scores. Further, the volume of significant activation was indifferent (p > 0.05) across spatial resolution specifically at the highest temporal resolution of 500 ms. These results demonstrate that the overall BOLD sensitivity can be increased significantly with temporal resolution, granted an adequately high spatial resolution with minimal physiological noise level. This shows the feasibility of diffuse motor-network imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution with robust BOLD sensitivity with 7T-fMRI. Importantly, we show that this sensitivity improvement could be extended to an fMRI application such as BCIs.

Dissociating frequency and animacy effects in visual word processing: An fMRI study	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Word frequency; Animacy; Word processing; fMRI; MVPA; STATIS	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FORM AREA; READING ALOUD; SPEECH PRODUCTION; LEXICAL DECISION; SEMANTIC SYSTEM; TEMPORAL CORTEX; PARAMETRIC FMRI; FUSIFORM GYRUS	In an fMRI investigation of the neural representation of word frequency and animacy, participants read high- and low-frequency words within living and nonliving semantic categories. Both temporal (left fusiform gyrus) and parietal (left supramarginal gyrus) activation patterns differentiated between animal and tool words after controlling for frequency. Activation patterns in a smaller ventral temporal region, a subset of the voxels identified in the animacy contrast, differentiated between high- and low-frequency words after controlling for animacy. Activation patterns in the larger temporal region distinguished between high- and low-frequency words just as well as patterns within the smaller region. However, in analyses by animacy category, frequency effects in these temporal regions were significant only for tool, not for animal, words. Thus, lexical word frequency information and semantic animacy category information are conjointly represented in left fusiform gyrus activation patterns for some, but not all, concrete nouns.

Here, we investigated the effects of local injection of ACh on fMRI and neural signals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized macaques by combining pharmaco-based MRI (phMRI) with electrophysiological recordings, using single electrodes and electrode arrays. We found that local injection of ACh elicited two distinct profiles of fMRI and neurophysiological activity, depending on the distance from the injector. Near the injection site, we observed an increase in the baseline blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses, while their visual modulation decreased. In contrast, further from the injection site, we observed an increase in the visually induced BOLD and CBF modulation without changes in baseline. Neurophysiological recordings suggest that the spatial correspondence between fMRI responses and neural activity does not change in the gamma, high-gamma, and multiunit activity (MUA) bands. The results near the injection site suggest increased inhibitory drive and decreased metabolism, contrasting to the far region. These changes are thought to reflect the kinetics of ACh and its metabolism to choline.

Latency analysis of resting-state BOLD-fMRI reveals traveling waves in visual cortex linking task-positive and task-negative networks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PROPAGATING WAVES; GLOBAL SIGNAL; LAG STRUCTURE; HUMAN BRAIN; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; CIRCUITS; PATTERNS	Due to the low temporal resolution of BOLD-fMRI, imaging studies on human brain function have almost exclusively focused on instantaneous correlations within the data. Developments in hardware and acquisition protocols, however, are offering data with higher sampling rates that allow investigating the latency structure of BOLD-fMRI data. In this study we describe a method for analyzing the latency structure within BOLD-fMRI data and apply it to resting-state data of 94 participants from the Human Connectome Project. The method shows that task-positive and task-negative networks are integrated through traveling BOLD waves within early visual cortex. The waves are initiated at the periphery of the visual field and propagate towards the fovea. This observation suggests a mechanism for the functional integration of task-positive and task-negative networks, argues for an eccentricity-based view on visual information processing, and contributes to the emerging view that resting-state BOLD-fMRI fluctuations are superpositions of inherently spatiotemporal patterns.

Machine Learning Based Classification of Resting-State fMRI Features Exemplified by Metabolic State (Hunger/Satiety)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain functional activity and connectivity; feature selection; resting-state fMRI; hunger; satiety; support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FOOD-INTAKE; ICA-AROMA; CENTRALITY; STABILITY; DISORDER	Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an essential measure to investigate the human brain's spontaneous activity and intrinsic functional connectivity. Several studies including our own previous work have shown that the brain controls the regulation of energy expenditure and food intake behavior. Accordingly, we expected different metabolic states to influence connectivity and activity patterns in neuronal networks. Methods: The influence of hunger and satiety on rs-fMRI was investigated using three connectivity models (local connectivity, global connectivity and amplitude rs-fMRI signals). After extracting the connectivity parameters of 90 brain regions for each model, we used sequential forward floating selection strategy in conjunction with a linear support vector machine classifier and permutation tests to reveal which connectivity model differentiates best between metabolic states (hunger vs. satiety). Results: We found that the amplitude of rs-fMRI signals is slightly more precise than local and global connectivity models in order to detect resting brain changes during hunger and satiety with a classification accuracy of 81%. Conclusion: The amplitude of rs-fMRI signals serves as a suitable basis for machine learning based classification of brain activity. This opens up the possibility to apply this combination of algorithms to similar research questions, such as the characterization of brain states (e.g., sleep stages) or disease conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, minimal cognitive impairment).

These complex functional dynamics, measured by EEG and fMRI, are thought to arise from a shared underlying structural architecture, which can be measured by diffusion MRI (dMRI). While simulation and data transformation (e.g. graph theory measures) have been proposed to refine the understanding of the underlying function-structure relationship, the potential complementary and/or independent contribution of EEG and fMRI to this relationship is still poorly understood. As such, we explored this relationship by analyzing the function-structure correlation in fourteen healthy subjects with simultaneous resting-state EEG-fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. We show that the combination of EEG and fMRI connectivity better explains dMRI connectivity and that this represents a genuine model improvement over fMRI-only models for both group-averaged connectivity matrices and at the individual level. Furthermore, this model improves the prediction within each resting-state network. The best model fit to underlying structure is mediated by fMRI and EEG-delta connectivity in combination with Euclidean distance and interhemispheric connectivity with more local contributions of EEG-gamma at the scale of resting-state networks. This highlights that the factors mediating the relationship between functional and structural metrics of connectivity are context and scale dependent, influenced by topological, geometric and architectural features. It also suggests that fMRI studies employing simultaneous EEG measures may characterize additional and essential parts of the underlying neuronal activity of the resting-state, which might be of special interest for both clinical studies and the investigation of resting-state dynamics.

Here, we developed a connectome-based brain network model that integrates individual structural and functional data with neural population dynamics to support multi-scale neurophysiological inference. Simulated populations were linked by structural connectivity and, as a novelty, driven by electroencephalography (EEG) source activity. Simulations not only predicted subjects' individual resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and spatial network topologies over 20 minutes of activity, but more importantly, they also revealed precise neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie and link six empirical observations from different scales and modalities: (1) resting-state fMRI oscillations, (2) functional connectivity networks, (3) excitation-inhibition balance, (4, 5) inverse relationships between alpha-rhythms, spike-firing and fMRI on short and long time scales, and (6) fMRI power-law scaling. These findings underscore the potential of this new modelling framework for general inference and integration of neurophysiological knowledge to complement empirical studies.

Although several targets and protocols have been suggested, comparative studies of tDCS parameters, particularly electrode montages and their cortical targets, are still lacking. Objective: This study investigated a priori hypotheses on specific effects of prefrontal-tDCS montages by using multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy participants. Methods: 28 healthy male participants underwent three common active-tDCS montages and sham tDCS in a pseudo-randomized order, comprising a total of 112 tDCS-fMRI sessions. Active tDCS was applied at 2 mA for 20 min. Before and after tDCS, a resting-state fMRI (RS fMRI) was recorded, followed by a task fMRI with a delayed-response working-memory (DWM) task for assessing cognitive control over emotionally negative or neutral distractors. Results: After tDCS with a cathode-F3/anode-F4 montage, RS-fMRI connectivity decreased in a medial part of the left PFC. Also, after the same stimulation condition, regional brain activity during DWM retrieval decreased more in this area after negative than after neutral distraction, and responses to the DWM task were faster, independent of distractor type. Conclusion: The current study does not confirm our a priori hypotheses on direction and localization of polarity-dependent tDCS effects using common bipolar electrode montages over PFC regions, but it provides evidence for montage-specific effects on multimodal neurophysiological and behavioral outcome measures. Systematic research on the actual targets and the respective dose-response relationships of prefrontal tDCS is warranted. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

For each animal, multiple consecutive fMRI measurements were made during a 3-h experiment session, with each measurement consisting of a baseline period, an odorant stimulation period, and a recovery period. Two different stimulation paradigms with a stimulation period of 40 s or 80 s, respectively, were used to study olfactory processing. Odorant-induced CBV increases were robustly observed in the OB and HOR of each individual animal. Olfactory adaptation, which is characterized by an attenuation of responses to continuous exposure or repeated stimulations, has different characteristics in the OB and HOR. For adaptation to repeated stimuli, while it was observed in both the OB and HOR, CBV responses in the HOR were attenuated more significantly than responses in the OB. In contrast, within each continuous 40-s or 80-s odor exposure, CBV responses in the OB were stable and did not show adaptation, but the CBV responses in the HOR were state dependent, with no adaptation during initial exposures, but significant adaptation during following exposures. These results support previous reports that HOR plays a more significant role than OB in olfactory habituation. The technical approach presented in this study should enable more extensive fMRI studies of olfactory processing in rats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, some information about the directionality of network connections can nevertheless be extracted from the matrix of pairwise temporal correlations between all considered time series, when expressed in the frequency-domain as a cross-spectral density matrix. Using a sparsity prior, it then becomes possible to determine a unique directed network topology that best explains the observed undirected correlations, without having to rely on temporal precedence relationships that may not be valid in fMRI. Applying this method on simulated data with 100 nodes yielded excellent retrieval of the underlying directed networks under a wide variety of conditions. Importantly, the method did not depend on temporal precedence to establish directionality, thus reducing susceptibility to hemodynamic variability. The computational efficiency of the algorithm was sufficient to enable whole-brain estimations, thus circumventing the problem of missing nodes that otherwise occurs in partial-brain analyses. Applying the method to real resting-state fMRI data acquired with a high temporal resolution, the inferred networks showed good consistency with structural connectivity obtained from diffusion tractography in the same subjects. Interestingly, this agreement could also be seen when considering high-frequency rather than low-frequency connectivity (average correlation: r = 0.26 for f < 0.3 Hz, r = 0.43 for 0.3 < f < 5 Hz). Moreover, this concordance was significantly better (p < 0.05) than for networks obtained with conventional functional connectivity based on correlations (average correlation r = 0.18). The presented methodology thus appears to be well-suited for fMRI, particularly given its lack of explicit dependence on temporal lag structure, and is readily applicable to whole-brain effective connectivity estimation.

Dynamic Coupling between fMRI Local Connectivity and Interictal EEG in Focal Epilepsy: AWavelet Analysis Approach	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; functional connectivity; wavelet coherence; DRePS; focal epilepsy	CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS; STATE; MRI; OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGES; ARTIFACT; SEIZURES	Simultaneous scalp EEG-fMRI recording is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique for combining electrophysiological and hemodynamic aspects of brain function. Despite the time-varying nature of both measurements, their relationship is usually considered as time-invariant. The aim of this study was to detect direct associations between scalp-recorded EEG and regional changes of hemodynamic brain connectivity in focal epilepsy through a time-frequency paradigm. To do so, we developed a voxel-wise framework that analyses wavelet coherence between dynamic regional phase synchrony (DRePS, calculated from fMRI) and band amplitude fluctuation (BAF) of a target EEG electrode with dominant interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). As a proof of concept, we applied this framework to seven patients with focal epilepsy. The analysis produced patient-specific spatial maps of DRePS-BAF coupling, which highlight regions with a strong link between EEG power and local fMRI connectivity. Although we observed DRePS-BAF coupling proximate to the suspected seizure onset zone in some patients, our results suggest that DRePS-BAF is more likely to identify wider 'epileptic networks'. We also compared DRePS-BAF with standard EEG-fMRI analysis based on general linear modelling (GLM). There was, in general, little overlap between the DRePS-BAF maps and GLM maps. However, in some subjects the spatial clusters revealed by these two analyses appeared to be adjacent, particularly in medial posterior cortices. Our findings suggest that (1) there is a strong time-varying relationship between local fMRI connectivity and interictal EEG power in focal epilepsy, and (2) that DRePS-BAF reflect different aspects of epileptic network activity than standard EEG-fMRI analysis. These two techniques, therefore, appear to be complementary. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Magnetoencephalographic and functional MRI connectomics in schizophrenia via intra- and inter-network connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Imaging; MEG; Functional connectivity; Resting state connectivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HEART-RATE; MEG; EEG; LOCALIZATION; SYNCHRONY; DYSCONNECTION; OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION	Examination of intrinsic functional connectivity using functional MRI (fMRI) has provided important findings regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. Extending these results using a complementary neuroimaging modality, magnetoencephalography (MEG), we present the first direct comparison of functional connectivity between schizophrenia patients and controls, using these two modalities combined. We developed a novel MEG approach for estimation of networks using MEG that incorporates spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and pairwise correlations between independent component timecourses, to estimate intra- and intern network connectivity. This analysis enables group-level inference and testing of between-group differences. Resting state MEG and fMRI data were acquired from a large sample of healthy controls (n=45) and schizophrenia patients (n=46). Group spatial ICA was performed on fMRI and MEG data to extract intrinsic fMRI and MEG networks and to compensate for signal leakage in MEG. Similar, but not identical spatial independent components were detected for MEG and fMRI. Analysis of functional network connectivity (FNC; i.e., pairwise correlations in network (ICA component) timecourses) revealed a differential between-modalities pattern, with greater connectivity among occipital networks in fMRI and among frontal networks in MEG. Most importantly, significant differences between controls and patients were observed in both modalities. MEG FNC results in particular indicated dysfunctional hyperconnectivity within frontal and temporal networks in patients, while in fMRI FNC was always greater for controls than for patients. This is the first study to apply group spatial ICA as an approach to leakage correction, and as such our results may be biased by spatial leakage effects. Results suggest that combining these two neuroimaging modalities reveals additional disease-relevant patterns of connectivity that were not detectable with fMRI or MEG alone.

No time for drifting: Comparing performance and applicability of signal detrending algorithms for real-time fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Real-time fMRI; Detrending; Temporal stability; Signal drifts; Incremental GLM; Moving average	MOTION CORRECTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; INTRAOPERATIVE MRI; BRAIN ACTIVATION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; BOLD-CONTRAST; NEUROFEEDBACK; COMPENSATION; CONNECTIVITY; STIMULATION	As a consequence of recent technological advances in the field of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), results can now be made available in real-time. This allows for novel applications such as online quality assurance of the acquisition, intra-operative fMRI, brain-computer-interfaces, and neurofeedback. To that aim, signal processing algorithms for real-time fMRI must reliably correct signal contaminations due to physiological noise, head motion, and scanner drift. The aim of this study was to compare performance of the commonly used online detrending algorithms exponential moving average (EMA), incremental general linear model (iGLM) and sliding window iGLM (iGLM(window)). For comparison, we also included offline detrending algorithms (i.e., MATLAB's and SPM8's native detrending functions). Additionally, we optimized the EMA control parameter, by assessing the algorithm's performance on a simulated data set with an exhaustive set of realistic experimental design parameters. First, we optimized the free parameters of the online and offline detrending algorithms. Next, using simulated data, we systematically compared the performance of the algorithms with respect to varying levels of Gaussian and colored noise, linear and non-linear drifts, spikes, and step function artifacts. Additionally, using in vivo data from an actual rte-fMRI experiment, we validated our results in a post hoc offline comparison of the different detrending algorithms. Quantitative measures show that all algorithms perform well, even though they are differently affected by the different artifact types. The iGLM approach outperforms the other online algorithms and achieves online detrending performance that is as good as that of offline procedures. These results may guide developers and users of real-time fMRI analyses tools to best account for the problem of signal drifts in real-time fMRI.

Pre-surgical planning included fMRI localization of language, motor, and sensory processing, and DTI of white matter tracts. fMRI results revealed no activation near the planned resection zone. However, post-surgery the patient developed a subdural fluid collection, which applied pressure to the primary motor cortex (M1). Follow-up scans revealed that motor activation had shifted due to pressure, and then shifted to a new location after the fluid collection subsided. This case report suggests that long-term neural reorganization can occur in response to short term compression in the cortex.

Although the use of the boxcar-shaped hemodynamic response function (BHRF) and canonical hemodynamic response (CHRF) has gained increasing popularity in rodent fMRI studies, whether the selected HRF affects the results of rodent fMRI has not been fully elucidated. Here we investigated the signal change and t-statistic sensitivities of BHRF, CHRF, and impulse response function (IRE). The effect of HRF selection on different tasks was analyzed by using data collected from two groups of rats receiving either 3 mA whisker pad or 3 mA forepaw electrical stimulations (n = 10 for each group). Under whisker pad stimulation with large blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal change (4.31 +/- 0.42%), BHRF significantly underestimated signal changes (P < 0.001) and t-statistics (P < 0.001) compared with CHRF or IRF. CHRF and IRF did not provide significantly different t-statistics (P > 0.05). Under forepaw stimulation with small BOLD signal change (1.71 +/- 0.34%), different HRFs provided insignificantly different t-statistics (P > 0.05). Therefore, the selected HRF can influence data analysis in rodent fMRI experiments with large BOLD responses but not in those with small BOLD responses.

PCA leverage: outlier detection for high-dimensional functional magnetic resonance imaging data	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						fMRI; High-dimensional statistics; Image analysis; Leverage; Outlier detection; Principal component analysis; Robust statistics	MOTION ARTIFACT; ROBUST	Outlier detection for high-dimensional (HD) data is a popular topic in modern statistical research. However, one source of HD data that has received relatively little attention is functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), which consists of hundreds of thousands of measurements sampled at hundreds of time points. At a time when the availability of fMRI data is rapidly growing-primarily through large, publicly available grassroots datasets-automated quality control and outlier detection methods are greatly needed. We propose principal components analysis (PCA) leverage and demonstrate how it can be used to identify outlying time points in an fMRI run. Furthermore, PCA leverage is a measure of the influence of each observation on the estimation of principal components, which are often of interest in fMRI data. We also propose an alternative measure, PCA robust distance, which is less sensitive to outliers and has controllable statistical properties. The proposed methods are validated through simulation studies and are shown to be highly accurate. We also conduct a reliability study using resting-state fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and find that removal of outliers using the proposed methods results in more reliable estimation of subject-level resting-state networks using independent components analysis.

Artifacts in EEG of simultaneous EEG-fMRI: pulse artifact remainders in the gradient artifact template are a source of artifact residuals after average artifact subtraction	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Average artifact subtraction; artifact reduction	BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACTS; REDUCTION; REMOVAL; MRI; RECORDINGS; EEG/FMRI; MOTION	Objective. The simultaneous application of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) opens up new ways to investigate the human brain. The EEG recordings of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, however, are overlaid to a great degree by fMRI related artifacts and an artifact reduction is mandatory before any EEG analysis. The most severe artifacts-the gradient artifact and the pulse artifact-are repetitive. Average artifact subtraction (AAS) technique exploits the repetitiveness and is presumably the most often used artifact reduction technique. In this method artifact templates are calculated by averaging over adjacent artifact epochs and subsequently the templates are subtracted to reduce the artifacts. Although the AAS technique is one of the best performing methods, artifact residuals are usually present in the resulting EEG after applying the AAS technique. This work aims at identifying sources of the artifact residuals. Approach. Application of the AAS technique to artificial EEG that is contaminated with artificial fMRI related artifacts. Main results. A new source of artifact residuals was identified. It was found that the AAS technique itself adds artifacts to the EEG during gradient artifact reduction, because the gradient artifact template is corrupted by pulse artifact remainders. Significance. This work shows that using a standard number of 25 epochs to calculate the gradient artifact template-as suggested by the inventors of AAS-results in substantial artifact residuals and consequently to a low EEG quality. Furthermore, the work discusses how potential solutions to this problem have serious side effects such as loss of adaptivity of the AAS technique. Hence, this problem must be considered carefully already in the design of simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments.

Recently, it has also been shown that weight loss interventions might affect fMRI food cue reactivity and that there is a close association between the alteration of cue reactivity and the outcome of the intervention. Here we tested whether fMRI food cue reactivity could be used as a marker of diet-induced early changes of neural processing in the striatum that are predictive of the outcome of the weight loss intervention. To this end we investigated the relationship between food cue reactivity in the striatum measured one month after the onset of the weight loss program and weight changes obtained at the end of the six-month intervention. We observed a significant correlation between BMI change measured after six months and early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum, including the bilateral putamen, right pallidum, and left caudate. Our findings provide evidence for diet-induced early alterations of fMRI food cue reactivity in the striatum that can predict the outcome of the weight loss intervention.

Comparison of local spectral modulation, and temporal correlation, of simultaneously recorded EEG/fMRI signals during ketamine and midazolam sedation	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Simultaneous EEG; fMRI; Ketamine; Midazolam; Frequency analysis	SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; RESTING STATE NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BLOOD-FLOW; FMRI; AMPLITUDE; POWER	Rationale and objectivesThe identification of biomarkers of drug action can be supported by non-invasive brain imaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with simultaneous collection plausibly overcoming the limitations of either modality alone. Despite this, few studies have assessed the feasibility and utility of recording simultaneous EEG/fMRI in a drug study.MethodsWe used simultaneous EEG/fMRI to assess the modulation of neural activity by ketamine and midazolam, in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, three-way cross-over design. Specifically, we analysed the sensitivity and direction of the spectral effects of each modality and the temporal correlations between the modulations of power of the common EEG bands and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal.Results and conclusionsDemonstrating feasibility, local spectral effects were similar to those found in previous non-simultaneous EEG and fMRI studies. Ketamine administration resulted in a widespread reduction of BOLD fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and a diverse pattern of effects in the different EEG bands. Midazolam increased fALFF in occipital, parietal, and temporal areas, and frontal delta and beta EEG power. While EEG spectra were more sensitive to pharmacological modulations than the fALFF bands, there was no clear spatial relationship between the two modalities. Additionally, ketamine modulated the temporal correlation strengths between the theta EEG band and the BOLD signal, whereas midazolam altered temporal correlations with the alpha and beta bands. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of simultaneous recording: each modality provides unique insights, and combinatorial analyses elicit more information than separate recordings.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a promising tool for identifying patients with MCI, but an accurate and robust analysis method is needed to extract discriminative rs-fMRI features for classification between MCI patients and healthy people. In this paper, a new rs-fMRI data analysis approach based on Chaotic Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (CBGWO) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), namely (CBGWO-ANFIS), is presented to distinguish MCI patients based on rs-fMRI. CBGWO is a new feature selection model that attempts to reduce the number of features without loss of significant information for classification, and it uses the naive Bayes criterion as a part of the objective function. Based on the chaos theory, the important parameters of GWO are estimated and tuned by using ten different chaos sequence maps. Subsequently, ANFIS is used to classify MCI patients and healthy people based on the subset of features retained by CBGWO. Experiments were carried out on 62 MCI patients and 65 normal controls (NC). Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (f-ALFF) was extracted from rs-fMRI as features. The results indicate that the proposed CBGWO-ANFIS approach with the Chebyshev chaos map shows a higher accuracy (around 86%), higher convergence speed, and shorter execution time than other chaos maps. Further, the proposed approach outperforms the conventional machine learning techniques and the recent meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. This study indicates that the proposed CBGWO-ANFIS approach on rs-fMRI could be a potential tool for early diagnosis of MCI. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to assess the alterations in intrinsic brain activity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer.MethodsChemotherapy treatment (CT) group included sixteen women aged60years (range 60-82years) with stage I-III breast cancers, who underwent both resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological testing with NIH Toolbox for Cognition before adjuvant chemotherapy, at time point 1 (TP1), and again within 1month after completing chemotherapy, at time point 2 (TP2). Fourteen age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent the same assessments at matched intervals. Three voxel-wise rs-fMRI parameters: amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and regional homogeneity, were computed at each time point. The changes in rs-fMRI parameters from TP1 to TP2 for each group, the group differences in changes (the CT group vs. the HC group), and the group difference in the baseline rs-fMRI parameters were assessed. In addition, correlative analysis between the rs-fMRI parameters and neuropsychological testing scores was also performed.ResultsIn the CT group, one brain region, which included parts of the bilateral subcallosal gyri and right anterior cingulate gyrus, displayed increased ALFF from TP1 to TP2 (cluster p-corrected=0.024); another brain region in the left precuneus displayed decreased fALFF from TP1 to TP2 (cluster level p-corrected=0.025). No significant changes in the rs-fMRI parameters from TP1 to TP2 were observed in the HC group. Although ALFF and fALFF alterations were observed only in the CT group, none of the between-group differences in rs-fMRI parameter changes reached statistical significance.ConclusionsOur study results of ALFF and fALFF alterations in the chemotherapy-treated women suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy may affect intrinsic brain activity in older women with breast cancer.

Optimal slice timing correction and its interaction with fMRI parameters and artifacts	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Slice timing correction; Interleaved acquisition; Interpolation; fMRI; EPI	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; MOTION CORRECTION; REGISTRATION; BRAIN; SEGMENTATION; ACCURATE; ROBUST; MRI	Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices in the plane of acquisition are not acquired simultaneously or sequentially, and therefore are temporally misaligned with each other. Slice timing correction (STC) is a critical preprocessing step that corrects for this temporal misalignment. Interpolation-based STC is implemented in all major fMRI processing software packages. To date, little effort has gone towards assessing the optimal method of STC. Delineating the benefits of STC can be challenging because of its slice-dependent gain as well as its interaction with other fMRI artifacts. In this study, we propose a new optimal method (Filter-Shift) based on the fundamental properties of sampling theory in digital signal processing. We then evaluate our method by comparing it to two other methods of STC from the most popular statistical software packages, SPM and FSL. STC methods were evaluated using 338 simulated and 30 real fMRI data and demonstrate the effectiveness of STC in general as well as the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to existing ones. All methods were evaluated under various scan conditions such as motion level, interleave sequence, scanner sampling rate, and the duration of the scan itself. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To effectively minimize the magnetic field distortion and image artifacts, the magnetic susceptibility of the implantable coil needs to be evaluated before practical use. In this work, we experimentally identify the magnetic susceptibility of each component of the implantable coil with the 7T Bruker NMR imaging scanner and provide useful guidelines for the following manufacturing. A 5 x 5 mm(2) implantable surface coil with a tunable frequency range is subsequently introduced for the 7T fMRI of the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL). A detachable external tuning circuit for the implantable coil is employed to facilitate in-vivo measurements in the rat model.

Moreover, patients are often recommended not to undergo surgery if the accompanying risk to language appears to be too high. While standard fMRI language mapping protocols may have relatively good predictive value at the group level, they remain sub-optimal on an individual level. The standard tests used typically assess lexico-semantic aspects of language, and they do not accurately reflect the complexity of language either in comprehension or production at the sentence level. Among patients who had left hemisphere language dominance we assessed which tests are best at activating language areas in the brain. Method: We compared grammar tests (items testing word order in actives and passives, wh-subject and object questions, relativized subject and object clauses and past tense marking) with standard tests (object naming, auditory and visual responsive naming), using pre-operative fMRI. Twenty-five surgical candidates (13 females) participated in this study. Sixteen patients presented with a brain tumor, and nine with epilepsy. All participants underwent two pre-operative fMRI protocols: one including CYCLE-N grammar tests (items testing word order in actives and passives, wh-subject and object questions, relativized subject and object clauses and past tense marking); and a second one with standard fMRI tests (object naming, auditory and visual responsive naming). fMRI activations during performance in both protocols were compared at the group level, as well as in individual candidates. Results: The grammar tests generated more volume of activation in the left hemisphere (left/right angular gyrus, right anterior/posterior superior temporal gyrus) and identified additional language regions not shown by the standard tests (e. g., left anterior/posterior supramarginal gyrus). The standard tests produced more activation in left BA 47. Ten participants had more robust activations in the left hemisphere in the grammar tests and two in the standard tests. The grammar tests also elicited substantial activations in the right hemisphere and thus turned out to be superior at identifying both right and left hemisphere contribution to language processing. Conclusion: The grammar tests may be an important addition to the standard pre-operative fMRI testing.

Parallel group independent component analysis for massive fMRI data sets	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BLIND SEPARATION; ALGORITHM; SUBJECT; PCA; ICA	Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used in the field of functional neuroimaging to decompose data into spatio-temporal patterns of co-activation. In particular, ICA has found wide usage in the analysis of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Recently, a number of large-scale data sets have become publicly available that consist of rs-fMRI scans from thousands of subjects. As a result, efficient ICA algorithms that scale well to the increased number of subjects are required. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage likelihood-based algorithm for performing group ICA, which we denote Parallel Group Independent Component Analysis (PGICA). By utilizing the sequential nature of the algorithm and parallel computing techniques, we are able to efficiently analyze data sets from large numbers of subjects. We illustrate the efficacy of PGICA, which has been implemented in R and is freely available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network, through simulation studies and application to rs-fMRI data from two large multi-subject data sets, consisting of 301 and 779 subjects respectively.

Especially, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have made many great achievements with the rapid development of deep network computation. However, comparing with the goal of decoding orientation, position and object category from human fMRI in visual cortex, accurate reconstruction of image stimuli is a still challenging work. Current prevailing methods were composed of two independent steps, (1) decoding intermediate features from human fMRI and (2) reconstruction using the decoded intermediate features. The new concept of 'capsule' and 'capsule' based neural network were proposed recently. The 'capsule' represented a kind of structure containing a group of neurons to perform better feature representation. Especially, the high-level capsule's features in the capsule network (CapsNet) contains various features of image stimuli such as semantic class, orientation, location, scale and so on, and these features can better represent the processed information inherited in the fMRI data collected in visual cortex. In this paper, a novel CapsNet architecture based visual reconstruction (CNAVR) computation model is developed to reconstruct image stimuli from human fMRI. The CNAVR is composed of linear encoding computation from capsule's features to fMRI data and inverse reconstruction computation. In the first part, we trained the CapsNet model to obtain the non-linear mappings from images to high-level capsule's features, and from high-level capsule's features to images again in an end-to-end manner. In the second part, we trained the non-linear mapping from fMRI data of selected voxels to high-level capsule's features. For a new image stimulus, we can use the method to predict the corresponding high-level capsule's features using fMRI data, and reconstruct image stimuli with the trained reconstruction part in the CapsNet. We evaluated the proposed CNAVR method on the open dataset of handwritten digital images, and exceeded about 10% than the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art methods on the structural similarity index (SSIM). In addition, we explained the selected voxels in specific interpretable image features to prove the effectivity and generalization of the CNAVR method.

Recent advances in brain imaging allow for a better understanding of the neural underpinnings of AVHs. These findings strengthened transdiagnostic neurocognitive models that characterize these frequent and disabling experiences. At the same time, technical improvements in real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enabled the development of innovative and non-invasive methods with the potential to relieve psychiatric symptoms, such as fMRI-based neurofeedback (fMRI-NF). During fMRI-NF, brain activity is measured and fed back in real time to the participant in order to help subjects to progressively achieve voluntary control over their own neural activity. Precisely defining the target brain area/network(s) appears critical in fMRI-NF protocols. After reviewing the available neurocognitive models for AVHs, we elaborate on how recent findings in the field may help to develop strong a priori strategies for fMRI-NF target localization. The first approach relies on imaging-based "trait markers" (i.e., persistent traits or vulnerability markers that can also be detected in the presymptomatic and remitted phases of AVHs). The goal of such strategies is to target areas that show aberrant activations during AVHs or are known to be involved in compensatory activation (or resilience processes). Brain regions, from which the NF signal is derived, can be based on structural MRI and neurocognitive knowledge, or functional MRI information collected during specific cognitive tasks. Because hallucinations are acute and intrusive symptoms, a second strategy focuses more on "state markers." In this case, the signal of interest relies on fMRI capture of the neural networks exhibiting increased activity during AVHs occurrences, by means of multivariate pattern recognition methods. The fine-grained activity patterns concomitant to hallucinations can then be fed back to the patients for therapeutic purpose. Considering the potential cost necessary to implement fMRI-NF, proof-of-concept studies are urgently required to define the optimal strategy for application in patients with AVHs. This technique has the potential to establish a new brain imaging-guided psychotherapy for patients that do not respond to conventional treatments and take functional neuroimaging to therapeutic applications.

Thirty-eight participants completed a randomized control trial consisting of 2 groups (MM and non-intervention control groups) to study the effect of MM on BCI performance. The MM group participated in a 4-week MM intervention programme. Out of the 38 cohorts, five participants from the MM group and five from the control group were fMRI scanned for real and imagery movement of right hand, left hand and both feet, before and after intervention. Statistical parametric mapping was used for post processing and analysis of fMRI data. The MM group showed a significant improvement in BCI performance compared to the control group. The fMRI results showed activation of right hand, left hand and both feet motor imagery at fronto-parietal regions before MM training (p<0.05, family wise error). After MM training, the fMRI results revealed a focused activation in 3 out of 4 of the trained subjects during right hand motor imagery, 2 out of 4 of the trained subjects during both feet motor imagery and 1 out of 4 of the trained subjects during left hand motor imagery, compared to the control group. This is also correlated with the improvement of BCI accuracy of the intervention group after MM training. Mindfulness meditation improves BCI performance and is correlated with focused activation of the fronto-parietal region in fMRI during motor imagery.

It is not clear if findings from studies in rodents translate to olfactory processing in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, the effect of the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 on odorant-induced olfactory responses in the OB and PC of anesthetized NHPs (rhesus monkeys) was investigated by cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Isoamyl-acetate was used as the odor stimulant. For each NHP, sixty fMRI measurements were made during a 4-h period, with each 4-min measurement consisting of a 1-min baseline period, a 1-min odor stimulation period, and a 2-min recovery period. MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) was intravenously delivered 1 hour after starting fMRI. Before MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations were observed only in the OB, not in the PC. After MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations in the OB increased, and robust olfactory fMRI activations were observed in the PC. The data indicate that MK801 enhances the olfactory responses in both the OB and PC. The enhancement effects of MK801 are most likely from its blockage of NMDA receptors on local inhibitory interneurons and the attenuation of the inhibition onto principal neurons. This study suggests that the mechanism of local inhibitory control of principal neurons in the OB and PC derived from studies in rodents translates to NHPs.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) allows for in vivo exploration of large-scale brain networks with high spatial resolution. Its application in rodents affords researchers a powerful translational tool to directly assess/explore the effects of various pharmacological, lesion, and/or disease states on known neural circuits within highly controlled settings. Integration of animal and human research at the molecular-, systems-, and behavioral-levels using diverse neuroimaging techniques empowers more robust interrogations of abnormal/pathological processes, critical for evolving our understanding of neuroscience. We present a comprehensive protocol to evaluate resting-state brain networks using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in rodent model. Specifically, we begin with a brief review of the physiological basis for rs-fMRI technique and overview of rs-fMRI studies in rodents to date, following which we provide a robust step-by-step approach for rs-fMRI investigation including data collection, computational preprocessing, and brain network analysis. Pipelines are interwoven with underlying theory behind each step and summarized methodological considerations, such as alternative methods available and current consensus in the literature for optimal results. The presented protocol is designed in such a way that investigators without previous knowledge in the field can implement the analysis and obtain viable results that reliably detect significant differences in functional connectivity between experimental groups. Our goal is to empower researchers to implement rs-fMRI in their respective fields by incorporating technical considerations to date into a workable methodological framework.

This was done by measuring the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: BOLD contrast fMRI was performed with a 1.5T MRI scanner on 12 emmetropic subjects (refractive error <+/- 0.25Diopter) with no history of neurologic disorder. IHM conditions were applied to subjects by three convex lenses of + 5D, + 7D and + 10D. Visual stimuli with 0.34 cpd and 1.84 cpd spatial frequencies (SF) were presented as a block paradigm to the participants in three IHM states and normal vision state during fMRI data acquisition. Resultant fMRI data were compared among different refractive states. Results: Data analysis showed that IHM did not cause a significant change in the visual cortex activity throughout the presentation of 0.34 cpd SF visual stimulus and BOLD signal intensity remained approximately constant (p = 0.17). Although, fMRI responses to visual stimuli with spatial frequency of 1.84 cpd demonstrated that visual cortex activity was significantly reduced in IHM states compared to normal vision (p = 0.01), the results showed no significant differences between three different values of IHM. Conclusions: This study shows severe blurring caused by lens induced high myopia can decrease BOLD signal intensity depending on the visual stimulus pattern details. However in the low and moderate range of spatial frequencies, blur increment from + 5D up to + 10D is not associated with further reduction in the BOLD signal of the occipital visual cortex.

Our results showed that ICA methods perform very well and slightly better than SDL methods when functional networks' spatial overlaps are minor, but ICA methods have difficulty in differentiating functional networks with moderate or significant spatial overlaps. In contrast, the SDL algorithms perform consistently well no matter how functional networks spatially overlap, and importantly, SDL methods are significantly better than ICA methods when spatial overlaps between networks are moderate or severe. This work offers empirical better understanding of ICA and SDL algorithms in inferring functional networks from fMRI data and provides new guidelines and caveats when constructing and interpreting functional networks in the era of fMRI-based connectomics.

Recently, deep learning models exhibited ability in extracting meaningful hierarchical structures from brain imaging data, e.g., fMRI and DTI. However, deep learning models have been rarely used to explore the relation between brain structure and function yet. In this paper, we proposed a novel multimodal deep believe network (DBN) model to discover and quantitatively represent the hierarchical organizations of common and consistent brain networks from both fMRI and DTI data. A prominent characteristic of DBN is that it is capable of extracting meaningful features from complex neuroimaging data with a hierarchical manner. With our proposed DBN model, three hierarchical layers with hundreds of common and consistent brain networks across individual brains are successfully constructed through learning a large dimension of representative features from fMRI/DTI data.

J	Li, YC; Saxe, R; Anzellotti, S				Li, Yichen; Saxe, Rebecca; Anzellotti, Stefano			Intersubject MVPD: Empirical comparison of fMRI denoising methods for connectivity analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESTING STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; ARTIFACT; SIGNAL	Noise is a major challenge for the analysis of fMRI data in general and for connectivity analyses in particular. As researchers develop increasingly sophisticated tools to model statistical dependence between the fMRI signal in different brain regions, there is a risk that these models may increasingly capture artifactual relationships between regions, that are the result of noise. Thus, choosing optimal denoising methods is a crucial step to maximize the accuracy and reproducibility of connectivity models. Most comparisons between denoising methods require knowledge of the ground truth: of what is the 'real signal'. For this reason, they are usually based on simulated fMRI data. However, simulated data may not match the statistical properties of real data, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. In this article, we propose an approach to evaluate denoising methods using real (non-simulated) fMRI data. First, we introduce an intersubject version of multivariate pattern dependence (iMVPD) that computes the statistical dependence between a brain region in one participant, and another brain region in a different participant. iMVPD has the following advantages: 1) it is multivariate, 2) it trains and tests models on independent partitions of the real fMRI data, and 3) it generates predictions that are both between subjects and between regions. Since whole-brain sources of noise are more strongly correlated within subject than between subjects, we can use the difference between standard MVPD and iMVPD as a 'discrepancy metric' to evaluate denoising techniques (where more effective techniques should yield smaller differences). As predicted, the difference is the greatest in the absence of denoising methods. Furthermore, a combination of removal of the global signal and CompCorr optimizes denoising (among the set of denoising options tested).

Statistical harmonization corrects site effects in functional connectivity measurements from multi-site fMRI data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						aging; atlas; ComBat; fMRI; functional connectivity; graph theory; harmonization; multi-site; network efficiency	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; BRAIN NETWORKS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SINGLE-SUBJECT; TEST-RETEST; MRI; RELIABILITY; SCALE	Acquiring resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets at multiple MRI scanners and clinical sites can improve statistical power and generalizability of results. However, multi-site neuroimaging studies have reported considerable nonbiological variability in fMRI measurements due to different scanner manufacturers and acquisition protocols. These undesirable sources of variability may limit power to detect effects of interest and may even result in erroneous findings. Until now, there has not been an approach that removes unwanted site effects. In this study, using a relatively large multi-site (4 sites) fMRI dataset, we investigated the impact of site effects on functional connectivity and network measures estimated by widely used connectivity metrics and brain parcellations. The protocols and image acquisition of the dataset used in this study had been homogenized using identical MRI phantom acquisitions from each of the neuroimaging sites; however, intersite acquisition effects were not completely eliminated. Indeed, in this study, we found that the magnitude of site effects depended on the choice of connectivity metric and brain atlas. Therefore, to further remove site effects, we applied ComBat, a harmonization technique previously shown to eliminate site effects in multi-site diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cortical thickness studies. In the current work, ComBat successfully removed site effects identified in connectivity and network measures and increased the power to detect age associations when using optimal combinations of connectivity metrics and brain atlases. Our proposed ComBat harmonization approach for fMRI-derived connectivity measures facilitates reliable and efficient analysis of retrospective and prospective multi-site fMRI neuroimaging studies.

Olfactory functional MRI (fMRI) is an objective method to evaluate the olfactory function, but might be affected by the individual variation and the magnetic susceptibility artifact of basis cranii. To improve the reliability of olfactory fMRI, we explored the response of primary olfactory cortex (POC) across three different concentrations of odors. Fourty-four normal controls, 46 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 44 patients with AD underwent olfactory fMRI using lavender stimuli of three different (0.10, 0.33, and 1.00%) concentrations during one fMRI sequence with a 3.0T MRI scanner. The numbers of activated voxels in the POC, especially the activation changes during different concentrations were, analyzed. The POC activation pattern of controls showed olfactory adaptation at the higher concentration, whereas the AD patients showed not only increased olfactory threshold but also a lack of olfactory habituation. Five types of activation patterns across different concentrations were summarized to evaluate the olfactory function. The results showed that the activation pattern effectively found 40/44 (90.9%) of the ADs with impaired habituation, whereas 31/44 (70.5%) of the normal controls showed normal olfactory habituation. In MCIs, 29/46 (63.0%) of subjects showed impaired habituation. This finding indicates that the POC activation pattern of olfactory fMRI across different concentrations is useful in evaluating the olfactory function, which is important in the detection of early AD among MCI cases.

Therefore, we can extract diverse information from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data by processing it at multiple resolutions. We propose a framework, called Hierarchical Multi-resolution Mesh Networks (HMMNs), which establishes a set of brain networks at multiple resolutions of fMRI signal to represent the underlying cognitive process. Our framework, first, decomposes the fMRI signal into various frequency subbands using wavelet transform. Then, a brain network is formed at each subband by ensembling a set of local meshes. Arc weights of each local mesh are estimated by ridge regression. Finally, adjacency matrices of mesh networks obtained at different subbands are used to train classifiers in an ensemble learning architecture, called fuzzy stacked generalization (FSG). Our decoding performances on Human Connectome Project task-fMRI dataset reflect that HMMNs can successfully discriminate tasks with 99% accuracy, across 808 subjects. Diversity of information embedded in mesh networks of multiple subbands enables the ensemble of classifiers to collaborate with each other for brain decoding. The suggested HMMNs decode the cognitive tasks better than a single classifier applied to any subband. Also mesh networks have a better representation power compared to pairwise correlations or average voxel time series. Moreover, fusion of diverse information using FSG outperforms fusion with majority voting. We conclude that, fMRI data, recorded during a cognitive task, provide diverse information in multi-resolution mesh networks. Our framework fuses this complementary information and boosts the brain decoding performances obtained at individual subbands.	[Ertugrul, Itir Onal; Vural, Fatos T.

Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked recessive form of hereditary retinal degeneration, which, at advanced stages, leaves only small central islands of preserved retinal tissue. Unlike many other retinal diseases, the spared tissue in CHM supports excellent central vision and stable fixation. Such spared topography in CHM presents an ideal platform to explore the relationship between preserved central retinal structure and the retinotopic organization of visual cortex by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS. fMRI was conducted in four participants with CHM and four healthy control participants while they viewed drifting contrast pattern stimuli monocularly. A single similar to 3-minute fMRI run was collected for each eye separately. fMRI data were analyzed using the population receptive field (pRF) modeling approach. Participants also underwent ophthalmic evaluations of visual acuity and static automatic perimetry. RESULTS. The spatial distribution and strength of pRF estimates correlated positively and significantly with clinical outcome measures in most participants with CHM. Importantly, the positive relationship between clinical and pRF measurements increased with increasing disease progression. A less consistent relationship was observed for control participants. CONCLUSIONS. Although reflecting only a small sample size, clinical evaluations of visual function in participants with CHM were well characterized by the spatial distribution and strength of pRF estimates by using a single similar to 3-minute fMRI experiment. fMRI data analyzed with pRF modeling may be an efficient and objective outcome measure to complement current ophthalmic evaluations. Specifically, pRF modeling may be a feasible approach for evaluating the impact of interventions to restore visual function.

It meta-analyzes second-level test results of the studies and calculates Bayes Factors indicating whether the effect in each voxel is significantly different from zero. We compared results from Bayesian and classical meta-analyses by examining the overlap between the result from each method and that created by NeuroSynth as the target. As an example, we analyzed previous fMRI studies focusing on working memory extracted from NeuroSynth. The result from our Bayesian method showed a greater overlap than the classical method. In addition, Bayes Factors proved a better way to examine whether the evidence supported hypotheses than p-values. Given these, Bayesian meta-analysis provides neuroscientists with an alternative meta-analysis method for fMRI studies given the improved overlap with the NeuroSynth result and the practical and epistemological value of Bayes Factors that can directly test the presence of an effect.

Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies typically reported disrupted striatal connectivity in patients with psychosis and in individuals at clinical and genetic high risk of the disorder relative to healthy controls. This has not been widely studied in healthy individuals with subclinical psychotic-like experiences (schizotypy). Here we applied the emerging technology of multi-echo rs-fMRI to examine corticostriatal connectivity in this group, which is thought to drastically maximize physiological noise removal and increase BOLD contrast-to-noise ratio. Multi-echo rs-fMRI data (echo times, 12, 28, 44, 60 ms) were acquired from healthy individuals with low (LS, n = 20) and high (HS, n = 19) positive schizotypy as determined with the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE). After preprocessing to ensure optimal contrast and removal of non-BOLD signal components, whole-brain functional connectivity from six striatal seeds was compared between the HS and LS groups. Effects were considered significant at cluster-level p < .05 family-wise error correction. Compared to LS, HS subjects showed lower rs-fMRI connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal regions and ventral striatal regions. Lower connectivity was also observed between the dorsal putamen and the hippocampus, occipital regions, as well as the cerebellum. These results demonstrate that subclinical positive psychotic-like experiences in healthy individuals are associated with striatal hypoconnectivity as detected using multi-echo rs-fMRI. Further application of this approach may aid in characterizing functional connectivity abnormalities across the extended psychosis phenotype.

Artifact correction of EEG data for real-time applications, such as neurofeedback studies, is the subject of ongoing research. To date, average artifact subtraction (AAS) is the most widespread real-time method used to partially remove BCG and imaging artifacts without requiring extra hardware equipment; no alternative software-only real time methods for removing EEG artifacts are available. New methods: We introduce a novel, improved approach for real-time EEG artifact correction during fMRI (rtICA). The rtICA is based on real time independent component analysis (ICA) and it is employed following the AAS method. The rtICA was implemented and validated during EEG and fMRI experiments on healthy subjects. Results: Our results demonstrate that the rtICA employed after the rtAAS can obtain 98.4% success in detection of eye blinks, 4.4 times larger INPS reductions compared to RecView-corrected data, and effectively reduce motion artifacts, as well as imaging and muscle artifacts, in real time on six healthy subjects. Comparison with existing methods: We compared our real-time artifact reduction results with the rtAAS and various offline methods using multiple evaluation metrics, including power analysis. Importantly, the rtICA does not affect brain neuronal signals as reflected in EEG bands of interest, including the alpha band. Conclusions: A novel real-time ICA method was proposed for improving the EEG quality signal recorded during fMRI acquisition. The results show substantial reduction of different types of artifacts using realtime ICA method. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

This method of training dogs for awake, unrestrained fMRI employs a generalization procedure of stationing in several dissimilar locations to facilitate transfer of the stationing behavior to the real MRI scan environment; it does so without the need for extensive training time in the MRI scan environment, which can be expensive. Further, this method splits the training of a stationing (i.e., chin rest) behavior from desensitization to the MRI environment (i.e., 100+ decibel scan audio), the latter accomplished during dedicated Auditory Exposure conditioning sessions. The complete training and testing protocol required 14 hours and resulted in immediate transfer to novel locations. We also present examples of canine fMRI data that have been acquired from visual face processing and olfactory discrimination paradigms.

One important aspect of executive control is the ability to switch from one task to another, and task-switching paradigms have often been used in human volunteers to uncover the underlying neuronal processes. To date, however, no study has investigated task-switching paradigms in nonhuman primates during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We trained two rhesus macaques to switch between arm movement, eye movement, and passive fixation tasks during fMRI. Similar to results obtained in human volunteers, task switching elicits increased fMRI activations in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Our results indicate that the macaque monkey is a reliable model with which to investigate higher-order cognitive functioning such as task switching. As such, these results can pave the way for a detailed investigation of the neural basis of complex human behavior.

This is distinct from two-stage "group analysis" approaches traditionally considered in the fMRI literature, which separate the inference on the individual fMRI time courses from the inference at the population level. In our modeling approach we consider a spatiotemporal linear regression model and specifically account for the between-subjects heterogeneity in neuronal activity via a spatially informed multi-subject nonparametric variable selection prior. For posterior inference, in addition to Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms, we develop suitable variational Bayes algorithms. We show on simulated data that variational Bayes inference achieves satisfactory results at more reduced computational costs than using MCMC, allowing scalability of our methods. In an application to data collected to assess brain responses to emotional stimuli our method correctly detects activation in visual areas when visual stimuli are presented.

Particularly, artifact removal becomes a critical issue in experimental protocols with significant inherent recording noise, such as mobile EEG recordings and concurrent EEG-fMRI acquisitions. In this paper, we proposed a unified framework based on canonical correlation analysis for artifact removal. Raw signals were reorganized to construct a pair of matrices, based on which sources were sought through maximizing autocorrelation. Those sources related to artifacts were then removed by setting them as zeros, and the remaining sources were used to reconstruct artifact-free EEG. Both simulated and real recorded data were utilized to assess the proposed framework. Qualitative and quantitative results showed that the proposed framework was effective to remove artifacts from EEG signal. Specifically, the proposed method outperformed independent component analysis method for mitigating motion-related artifacts and had advantages for removing gradient artifact compared to the classical method (average artifacts subtraction) and the state-of-the-art method (optimal basis set) in terms of the combination of performance and computational complexity.

She manifested acutely with epileptic seizures accompanied by Broca aphasia as well as transient right hemiparesis. Due to refractory epilepsy developing over the next years, which originated from the left frontal lobe, the decision was made to proceed to epilepsy surgery. By then, her language functions had recovered despite progressive left frontal tissue-destruction, raising the possibility of a hemispheric shift of language. Clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted to localize brain regions involved in language production. A complex pattern of clear right-hemispheric dominance, but with some left-sided contribution was found. However, a Wada test suggested the left hemisphere to be critical, seemingly contradicting fMRI. Invasive electroencephalogram recordings could reconcile these results by identifying the fMRI-detected, residual left-sided activation as being relevant for speech production. Only by combining the localizing information from fMRI with the information obtained by two invasive procedures could the unusual pattern of late-onset language reorganization be uncovered. This allowed for extensive left frontal resection, with histology confirming meningocerebral angiodysplasia. Postoperatively, language functions were preserved and seizure outcome was excellent. The implications of our findings for presurgical assessments in children are discussed.

Laminar fMRI: Applications for cognitive neuroscience	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Laminar fMRI; Visual cortex; Cortical layers; Bottom-up; Top-down; Feedforward; Feedback	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; WORKING-MEMORY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; NEGATIVE BOLD; MODEL; V1; BRAIN; ORGANIZATION	The cortex is a massively recurrent network, characterized by feedforward and feedback connections between brain areas as well as lateral connections within an area. Feedforward, horizontal and feedback responses largely activate separate layers of a cortical unit, meaning they can be dissociated by lamina-resolved neurophysiological techniques. Such techniques are invasive and are therefore rarely used in humans. However, recent developments in high spatial resolution fMRI allow for non-invasive, in vivo measurements of brain responses specific to separate cortical layers. This provides an important opportunity to dissociate between feedforward and feedback brain responses, and investigate communication between brain areas at a more fine-grained level than previously possible in the human species. In this review, we highlight recent studies that successfully used laminar fMRI to isolate layer-specific feedback responses in human sensory cortex. In addition, we review several areas of cognitive neuroscience that stand to benefit from this new technological development, highlighting contemporary hypotheses that yield testable predictions for laminar fMRI. We hope to encourage researchers with the opportunity to embrace this development in fMRI research, as we expect that many future advancements in our current understanding of human brain function will be gained from measuring lamina-specific brain responses.

Spontaneous neural activity is indirectly measured from the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal as acquired by echo planar imaging ,when subjects quietly "resting" in the scanner. Animal models including disease or knockout models allow a broad spectrum of experimental manipulations not applicable in humans. The non-invasive fMRI approach provides a promising tool for cross-species comparative investigations. This review focuses on the principles of "resting-state" functional connectivity analysis and its applications to living animals. The translational aspect from in vivo animal models toward clinical applications in humans is emphasized. We introduce the fMRI-based investigation of the non-human brain's hemodynamics, the methodological issues in the data postprocessing, and the functional data interpretation from different abstraction levels. The longer term goal of integrating fMRI connectivity data with structural connectomes obtained with tracing and optical imaging approaches is presented and will allow the interrogation of fMRI data in terms of directional flow of information and may identify the structural underpinnings of observed functional connectivity patterns.

However, the brain's dynamical functional states recognition at fast time-scales in task fMRI data have been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a novel 5-layer deep sparse recurrent neural network (DSRNN) model to accurately recognize the brain states across the whole scan session. Specifically, the DSRNN model includes an input layer, one fully-connected layer, two recurrent layers, and a softmax output layer. The proposed framework has been tested on seven task fMRI data sets of Human Connectome Project. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DSRNN model can accurately identify the brain's state in different task fMRI data sets and significantly outperforms other auto-correlation methods or non-temporal approaches in the dynamic brain state recognition accuracy. In general, the proposed DSRNN offers a new methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research.

In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of fMRI data within the white matter acquired from humans both in the resting state and while watching a naturalistic movie. By using independent component analysis and hierarchical clustering, resting-state fMRI data in the white matter were de-noised and decomposed into spatially independent components, which were further assembled into hierarchically organized axonal fiber bundles. Interestingly, such components were partly reorganized during natural vision. Relative to resting state, the visual task specifically induced a stronger degree of temporal coherence within the optic radiations, as well as significant correlations between the optic radiations and multiple cortical visual networks. Therefore, fMRI contains rich functional information about the activity and connectivity within white matter at rest and during tasks, challenging the conventional practice of taking white-matter signals as noise or artifacts.

Low-dimensional morphospace of topological motifs in human fMRI brain networks	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Morphospace; Network motifs; Graph theory; fMRI; Functional connectivity; Human brain networks	SMALL-WORLD; CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION; FREQUENCY; MODELS	We present a low-dimensional morphospace of fMRI brain networks, where axes are defined in a data-driven manner based on the network motifs. The morphospace allows us to identify the key variations in healthy fMRI networks in terms of their underlying motifs, and we observe that two principal components (PCs) can account for 97% of the motif variability. The first PC of the motif distribution is correlated with efficiency and inversely correlated with transitivity. Hence this axis approximately conforms to the well-known economical small-world trade-off between integration and segregation in brain networks. Finally, we show that the economical clustering generative model proposed by Vertes et al (2012) can approximately reproduce the motif morphospace of the real fMRI brain networks, in contrast to other generative models. Overall, the motif morphospace provides a powerful way to visualize the relationships between network properties and to investigate generative or constraining factors in the formation of complex human brain functional networks.

Method: We divided 133 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores from 0.5 to 3 into two groups based on dementia severity; the groups with very mild/mild (CDR: 0.5-1) and moderate to severe (CDR: 2-3) dementia consisted of 77 and 56 subjects, respectively. We used rs-fMRI to extract functional connectivity features, calculated using independent component analysis (ICA), and performed automated severity classification with three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) based on deep learning. Results: The mean balanced classification accuracy was 0.923 +/- 0.042 (p < 0.001) with a specificity of 0.946 +/- 0.019 and sensitivity of 0.896 +/- 0.077. The rs-fMRI data indicated that the medial frontal, sensorimotor, executive control, dorsal attention, and visual related networks mainly correlated with dementia severity. Conclusions: Our CDR-based novel classification using rs-fMRI is an acceptable objective severity indicator. In the absence of trained neuropsychologists, dementia severity can be objectively and accurately classified using a 3D-deep learning framework with rs-fMRI independent components.

Thirty-nine patients underwent high-frequency ultrasound, and one patient with superficial radial nerve injury (27-mm defect) underwent fMRI at one, three, and six postoperative months. The fMRI examination results were compared with sensory detection and high-frequency ultrasound results during the same follow-up window period. The normal and regenerated nerve bundles had similar ultrasonic imaging features. At one postoperative month, fMRI displayed activeness of the normal cortex in the brain region corresponding to the contralateral superficial radial nerve, while no activeness was observed on the ipsilateral side. From three to six postoperative months, fMRI revealed gradually increasing activeness in the brain region corresponding to the ipsilateral superficial radial nerve, but the activation area on the ipsilateral side was smaller than that on the contralateral side. Combining morphological detection of the regenerated nerve using high-frequency ultrasound and functional detection of the regenerated nerve using fMRI may be a valuable method for evaluating repair of peripheral nerve injury.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to optimize the parameters in the seed correlation analysis using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) toolbox for rs-fMRI data received from a Siemens Magnetom Skyra 3-Tesla scanner using a whole-brain, gradient-echo echo planar sequence with a 32-channel head coil. Different ranges of the following parameters: amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), Gaussian kernel at FWHM and radius of spherical ROI for 109 regions were tested for 20 healthy volunteers. The highest values of functional connectivity (FC) correlations were found for ALFF 0.01-0.08, spherical ROIs with the 8-mm radius and Gaussian kernel 8 mm at FWHM in all the studied areas that is, Auditory, Sensimotor, Visual, and Default Mode Network. The dominating influence of ALFF and smoothing on values of FC correlations was noted.

Method We observed cerebral cortex activation in a 52-year-old man in a VS, and in a healthy individual using fMRI during passive listening and motor-imagery tasks. The patient received oral amantadine for 3 months. fMRI was repeated after treatment. Results Activation around the left insular regions occurred during stimulation by a familiar voice, and activity in the left temporal and bi-occipital cortices occurred during stimulation by a familiar/unfamiliar voice. Activity in the bilateral frontal and parietal cortices occurred during the motor-imagination task. Brain cortex activation was reduced in the VS patient compared with the healthy volunteer. However, the patient responded to certain auditory stimuli and motor imagery, suggesting that he retained some intact auditory and motor cortical functions. fMRI scans after 3 months of treatment showed increased activation of brain areas corresponding to task instructions. Conclusion fMRI could be used to observe the effects of amantadine on brain function, and to aid the diagnosis and prognostic prediction in VS patients in terms of recovery and rehabilitation planning.

To characterize the dynamics of the neural networks and the underlying neuroplasticity of the central motor system, neuroimaging tools with high spatial and temporal accuracy are desirable. EEG and fMRI stand among the most popular noninvasive neuroimaging modalities with complementary features, yet achieving both high spatial and temporal accuracy remains a challenge. A novel multimodal EEG/fMRI integration method was developed in this study to achieve high spatiotemporal accuracy by employing the most probable fMRI spatial subsets to guide EEG source localization in a time-variant fashion. In comparison with the traditional fMRI constrained EEG source imaging method in a visual/motor activation task study, the proposed method demonstrated superior localization accuracy with lower variation and identified neural activity patterns that agreed well with previous studies. This spatiotemporal fMRI constrained source imaging method was then implemented in a "sequential multievent-related potential" paradigm where motor activation is evoked by emotion-related visual stimuli. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used as a powerful neuroimaging tool to unveil the dynamics and neural networks associated with the central motor system, providing insights into neuroplasticity modulation mechanism.

This technique stands on solid foundations established by the physics of magnetic resonance and the physiology of hemodynamics and is complimented by computational and statistical techniques. I argue, and support using concrete examples, that these foundations give rise to a productive theory-ladenness in fMRI, which enables researchers to identify and control for the types of methodological and inferential errors. Consequently, this makes it possible for researchers to represent and investigate cognitive phenomena in terms of hemodynamic data and for experimental knowledge to grow independently of large scale theories of cognition.

Novel Functional MRI Task for Studying the Neural Correlates of Upper Limb Tremor	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						tremor; upper limb; fMRI; validation; reproducibility	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; FMRI RELIABILITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; ACTIVATION	Introduction: Tremor of the upper limbs is a disabling symptom that is present during several neurological disorders and is currently without treatment. Functional MRI (fMRI) is an essential tool to investigate the pathophysiology of tremor and aid the development of treatment options. However, no adequately or standardized protocols for fMRI exists at present. Here we present a novel, online available fMRI task that could be used to assess the in vivo pathology of tremor. Objective: This study aims to validate the tremor-evoking potential of the fMRI task in a small group of tremor patients outside the scanner and assess the reproducibility of the fMRI task related activation in healthy controls. Methods: Twelve HCs were scanned at two time points (baseline and after 6-weeks). There were two runs of multi-band fMRI and the tasks included a "brick-breaker" joystick game. The game consisted of three conditions designed to control for most of the activation related to performing the task by contrasting the conditions: WATCH (look at the game without moving joystick), MOVE (rhythmic left/right movement of joystick without game), and PLAY (playing the game). Task fMRI was analyzed using FSL FEAT to determine clusters of activation during the different conditions. Maximum activation within the clusters was used to assess the ability to control for task related activation and reproducibility. Four tremor patients have been included to test ecological and construct validity of the joystick task by assessing tremor frequencies captured by the joystick. Results: In HCs the game activated areas corresponding to motor, attention and visual areas. Most areas of activation by our game showed moderate to good reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.531-0.906) with only inferior parietal lobe activation showing poor reproducibility (ICC 0.446). Furthermore, the joystick captured significantly more tremulous movement in tremor patients compared to HCs (p = 0.01) during PLAY, but not during MOVE. Conclusion: Validation of our novel task confirmed tremor-evoking potential and reproducibility analyses yielded acceptable results to continue further investigations into the pathophysiology of tremor. The use of this technique in studies with tremor patient will no doubt provide significant insights into the treatment options.	[Boonstra, Frederique M.

In this hospital-based case-control cross-sectional study, fMRI and DTI were conducted in strabismic amblyopes before initiation of any therapy and after visual recovery following the administration of occlusion therapy. FMRI was performed in 10 strabismic amblyopic subjects (baseline group) and in 5 left strabismic amblyopic children post-occlusion therapy after two-line visual improvement. Ten age-matched healthy children with right ocular dominance formed control group. Structural and functional MRI was carried out on 1.5T MR scanner. The visual task consisted of 8 Hz flickering checkerboard with red dot and occasional green dot. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was analyzed using statistical parametric mapping and DTI on NordicIce (NordicNeuroLab) softwares. Reduced occipital activation was elicited when viewing with the amblyopic eye in amblyopes. An 'ipsilateral to viewing eye' pattern of calcarine BOLD activation was observed in controls and left amblyopes. Activation of cortical areas associated with visual processing differed in relation to the viewing eye.

Despite the well-documented individual differences in pain experience and brain responses, it still remains unclear how and to what extent these individual differences affect the performance of between-individual fMRI-based pain prediction. The present study is aimed to examine the relationship between individual differences in pain prediction models and between-individual prediction error, and, further, to identify brain regions that contribute to between-individual prediction error. To this end, we collected and analyzed fMRI data and pain ratings in a laser-evoked pain experiment. By correlating different types of individual difference metrics with between-individual prediction error, we are able to quantify the influence of these individual differences on prediction performance and reveal a set of brain regions whose activities are related to prediction error. Interestingly, we found that the precuneus, which does not have predictive capability to pain, could also affect the prediction error. This study elucidates the influence of interindividual variability in pain on the between-individual prediction performance, and the results will be useful for the design of more accurate and robust fMRI-based pain prediction models.

Optogenetic auditory fMRI reveals the effects of visual cortical inputs on auditory midbrain response	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INFERIOR COLLICULUS; CORTICOFUGAL MODULATION; DESCENDING PROJECTIONS; BOLD FMRI; CORTEX; NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; PATHWAY; CONNECTIVITY; CELLS	Sensory cortices contain extensive descending (corticofugal) pathways, yet their impact on brainstem processing - particularly across sensory systems - remains poorly understood. In the auditory system, the inferior colliculus (IC) in the midbrain receives cross-modal inputs from the visual cortex (VC). However, the influences from VC on auditory midbrain processing are unclear. To investigate whether and how visual cortical inputs affect IC auditory responses, the present study combines auditory blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) with cell-type specific optogenetic manipulation of visual cortex. The results show that predominant optogenetic excitation of the excitatory pyramidal neurons in the infragranular layers of the primary VC enhances the noise-evoked BOLD fMRI responses within the IC. This finding reveals that inputs from VC influence and facilitate basic sound processing in the auditory midbrain. Such combined optogenetic and auditory fMRI approach can shed light on the large-scale modulatory effects of corticofugal pathways and guide detailed electrophysiological studies in the future.

Different experimental designs and solution delivery approaches may in part explain the variability reported in literature. These technical aspects certainly limit the development of taste-related brain computer interface devices. New Method: We propose a novel modular, scalable and low-cost device for rapid injection of small volumes of taste solutions during fMRI experiments that gathers the possibility to flexibly increase the number of channels, allowing complex multi-dimensional taste experiments. We provide the full description of the hardware and software architecture and illustrate the application of the working prototype in single-subject event-related fMRI experiments by showing the BOLD responses to basic taste qualities and to five intensities of tastes during the course of perception. Results: The device is shown to be effective in activating multiple clusters within the gustatory pathway and a precise time-resolved event-related analysis is shown to be possible by the impulsive nature of the induced perception. Comparison with Existing Method(s): This gustometer represents the first implementation of a low-cost, easily replicable and portable device that is suitable for all kinds of fMRI taste experiments. Its scalability will boost the experimental design of more complex multi-dimensional fMRI studies of the human taste pathway. Conclusions: The gustometer represents a valid open-architecture alternative to other available devices and its spread and development may contribute to an increased standardization of experimental designs in human fMRI studies of taste perception and pave the way to the development of novel taste-related BCIs.

Pediatric patients are often poor candidates for many modern mapping techniques because of inability to cooperate due to their immature age, cognitive deficits, or other factors. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is uniquely suited to benefit pediatric patients because it is inherently noninvasive and does not require task performance or significant cooperation. Recent advances in the field have made mapping cerebral networks possible on an individual basis for use in clinical decision making. The authors present their initial experience translating rs-fMRI into clinical practice for surgical planning in pediatric patients. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed cases in which the rs-fMRI analysis technique was used prior to craniotomy in pediatric patients undergoing surgery in their institution. Resting-state analysis was performed using a previously trained machine-learning algorithm for identification of resting-state networks on an individual basis. Network maps were uploaded to the clinical imaging and surgical navigation systems. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including need for sedation during imaging and use of task-based fMRI, were also recorded. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent rs-fMRI prior to craniotomy between December 2013 and June 2016. Their ages ranged from 1.9 to 18.4 years, and 12 were male. Five of the 20 patients also underwent task-based fMRI and one underwent awake craniotomy. Six patients required sedation to tolerate MRI acquisition, including resting-state sequences. Exemplar cases are presented including anatomical and resting-state functional imaging. CONCLUSIONS Resting-state fMRI is a rapidly advancing field of study allowing for whole brain analysis by a noninvasive modality. It is applicable to a wide range of patients and effective even under general anesthesia. The nature of resting-state analysis precludes any need for task cooperation. These features make rs-fMRI an ideal technology for cerebral mapping in pediatric neurosurgical patients. This review of the use of rs-fMRI mapping in an initial pediatric case series demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing this technique in pediatric neurosurgical patients. The preliminary experience presented here is a first step in translating this technique to a broader clinical practice.	[Roland, Jarod L.; Hacker, Carl D.; Vellimana, Ananth K.; Akbari, S.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an MRI-based neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity on the basis of blood oxygenation level. This study reviews the main fMRI methods reported in the literature and their related applications in clinical and preclinical studies, focusing on relating functional brain networks in the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a focus on the transition phases from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to AD. New method: The purpose of this study is to present and compare different approaches of supervised and unsupervised fMRI analyses and to highlight the different applications of fMRI in the diagnosis of MCI and AD. Results: Survey article asserts that brain network disruptions of a given dysfunction or in relation to disease prone areas of the brain in neurodegenerative dementias could be extremely useful in ascertaining the extent of cognitive deficits at the different stages of the disease. Identifying the earliest changes in these activity patterns is essential for the early planning of treatment and therapeutic protocols. Comparison with existing methods: Analysis methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) and graph theory-based approaches are strong analytical techniques most suitable for functional connectivity investigations. However, graph theory-based approaches have received more attention due to the higher performance they achieve in both functional and effective connectivity studies. Conclusion: This article shows that the disruption of brain connectivity patterns of MCI and AD could be associated with cognitive decline, an interesting finding that could augment the prospects for early diagnosis. More importantly, results reveal that changes in functional connectivity as obtained through fMRI precede detection of cortical thinning in structural MRI and amyloid deposition in positron emission tomography (PET). However, a major challenge in using fMRI as a single imaging modality, like all other imaging modalities used in isolation, is in relating a particular disruption in functional connectivity in relation to a specific disease. This is a challenge that requires more thorough investigation, and one that could perhaps be overcome through multimodal neuroimaging by consolidating the strengths of these individual imaging modalities.

The large-scale spatial organization of visual cortex can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects view spatially modulated visual stimuli, also known as "retinotopic mapping." One of the datasets collected by the Human Connectome Project involved ultrahigh-field (7 Tesla) fMRI retinotopic mapping in 181 healthy young adults (1.6-mm resolution), yielding the largest freely available collection of retinotopy data. Here, we describe the experimental paradigm and the results of model-based analysis of the fMRI data. These results provide estimates of population receptive field position and size. Our analyses include both results from individual subjects as well as results obtained by averaging fMRI time series across subjects at each cortical and subcortical location and then fitting models. Both the group-average and individual-subject results reveal robust signals across much of the brain, including occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex as well as subcortical areas. The group-average results agree well with previously published parcellations of visual areas. In addition, split-half analyses show strong within-subject reliability, further demonstrating the high quality of the data. We make publicly available the analysis results for individual subjects and the group average, as well as associated stimuli and analysis code.

The first is to apply confidence intervals to locate activations in real-time, and second is a new metric based on robust regression of fMRI signals. These contributions are implemented in our four proposed methods; Instantaneous Activation Method (TAM), Instantaneous Activation Method with Past Blocks (TAMP) for real-time analysis, Task Robust Regression Distance Method (TRRD) for the new metric with robust regression and Instantaneous Robust Regression Distance Method (IRRD) for both contributions. For comparison, a statistical offline method called Task Activation Method (TAM) and a correlation analysis method are also implemented. The methods are initially evaluated with synthetic data generated using two different approaches; first using varying hemodynamic response function signals to simulate a wide range of stimuli responses, along with a Gaussian white noise, and second using no activity state data of a real fMRI experiment, which removes the need to generate noise. The methods are also tested with real fMRI experiments and compared with the results obtained by the widely used SPM tool. The results show that instantaneous methods reveal activations that are lost statistically in an offline analysis. They also reveal further improvements by robust fitting application, which minimizes the outlier effect. TRRD has an area under the ROC curve of 0,7127 for very noisy synthetic images, is reaching up to 0,9608 as the noise decreases, while the instantaneous score is in the range of 0,6124 to 0,8019 in the same noise levels.

Any lags are compatible with axonal conduction velocities and neural integration times. The important analysis of resting state networks is generally based on the assumption that these principles also hold for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity. Previous observations using simultaneous EEG and fMRI indicate that slower processes, with delays in the seconds range, determine at least part of the relationship between spontaneous EEG and fMRI. To assess this relationship systematically, we used deconvolution analysis of EEG-fMRI during the resting state, assessing the relationship between EEG frequency bands and fMRI BOLD across the whole brain while allowing for time lags of up to 10.5 s. Cluster analysis, identifying similar BOLD time courses in relation to EEG band power peaks, showed a clear segregation of functional subsystems of the brain. Our analysis shows that fMRI BOLD increases commonly precede EEG power increases by seconds. Most zero-lag correlations, on the other hand, were negative. This indicates two main distinct neuromodulatory mechanisms: an "idling" mechanism of simultaneous electric and metabolic network anticorrelation and a "regulatory" mechanism in which metabolic network activity precedes increased EEG power by some seconds. This has to be taken into consideration in further studies which address the causal and functional relationship of metabolic and electric brain activity patterns.

To address this problem, it is suitable to measure brain activity by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which can measure activity in the entire brain at a high spatial resolution. In this study, we develop an fMRI-compatible steering force generation unit and verify its performance. To avoid disturbance due to the electromagnetic field of the MRI, the unit was configured as follows: a motor installed outside a scan room generated a reaction force that was transmitted to a steering wheel placed in the hands of a subject using a nonmagnetic transmission unit. To verify the performance of the unit, we measured the brain activity of participants of an experiment by using fMRI while they performed steering operations using their arm/arms under various steering forces. The results were consistent with those for motor-related brain activity obtained in past neuroimaging studies. We conclude that the proposed unit can measure brain activity through fMRI in the presence of a steering reaction force.

Unlike scalp EEG-fMRI, in most patients who undergo icEEG-fMRI, IEDs recorded intracranially are numerous and show variability in terms of field amplitude and morphology. Therefore, visual marking can be highly subjective and time consuming. In this study, we applied an automated spike classification algorithm, Wave_clus (WC), to IEDs marked visually on icEEG data acquired during simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The motivation of this work is to determine whether using a potentially more consistent and unbiased automated approach can produce more biologically meaningful BOLD patterns compared to the BOLD patterns obtained based on the conventional, visual classification. Methods: We analysed simultaneous icEEG-fMRI data from eight patients with severe drug resistant epilepsy, and who subsequently underwent resective surgery that resulted in a good outcome: confirmed epileptogenic zone (EZ). For each patient two fMRI analyses were performed: one based on the conventional visual IED classification and the other based on the automated classification. We used the concordance of the IED-related BOLD maps with the confirmed EZ as an indication of their biological meaning, which we compared for the automated and visual classifications for all IED originating in the EZ. Results: Across the group, the visual and automated classifications resulted in 32 and 24 EZ IED classes respectively, for which 75% vs 83% of the corresponding BOLD maps were concordant. At the single-subject level, the BOLD maps for the automated approach had greater concordance in four patients, and less concordance in one patient, compared to those obtained using the conventional visual classification, and equal concordance for three remaining patients. These differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: We found automated IED classification on icEEG data recorded during fMRI to be feasible and to result in IED-related BOLD maps that may contain similar or greater biological meaning compared to the conventional approach in the majority of the cases studied. We anticipate that this approach will help to gain significant new insights into the brain networks associated with IEDs and in relation to postsurgical outcome.

Resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is a non-invasive tool that enables the measurement of functional connectivity (FC) across the entire brain while placing minimal demands on the subject. For these reasons, it is a uniquely appealing tool for studying the distant effects of stroke. However, R-fMRI studies rely on a number of premises that cannot be assumed without careful validation in the context of stroke. Here, we describe strategies to identify and mitigate confounds specific to R-fMRI research in cerebrovascular disease. Five main topics are discussed: (a) achieving adequate co-registration of lesioned brains, (b) identifying and removing hemodynamic lags in resting BOLD, (c) identifying other vascular disruptions that affect the resting BOLD signal, (d) selecting an appropriate control cohort, and (e) acquiring sufficient fMRI data to reliably identify FC changes. For each topic, we provide guidelines for steps to improve the interpretability and reproducibility of FC-stroke research. We include a table of confounds and approaches to identify and mitigate each. Our recommendations extend to any research using R-fMRI to study diseases that might alter cerebrovascular flow and dynamics or brain anatomy.

Functional MRI (fMRI) in particular is becoming a widespread methodological tool for investigating speech and language. However, because MRI is relatively new and complex, potential consumers need to be able to critically assess the methods used in order to appraise results and conclusions. The authors offer a tutorial that (a) relays foundational knowledge related to the collection and analysis of MRI data in general and fMRI data specifically and (b) presents strategies for evaluating studies that utilize fMRI methods. Method: This tutorial outlines methodological considerations that should be addressed by fMRI researchers and noted by consumers of the research, including clinicians and behavioral researchers who work with neurogenic communication disorders. Results: Readers will be able to evaluate a neuroimaging publication and identify the methodological strengths and weaknesses that potentially influence the integrity of reported findings and interpretations.

However, though microscopic (e.g., two-photon imaging) studies in behaving mice have become a reality in many laboratories, awake mouse fMRI remains a challenge. Owing to variability in behavior among animals, performing all types of measurements within the same subject is highly desirable and can lead to higher scientific rigor. METHODS: We demonstrated blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI in awake mice implanted with long-term cranial windows that allowed optical access for microscopic imaging modalities and optogenetic stimulation. We started with two-photon imaging of single-vessel diameter changes (n = 1). Next, we implemented intrinsic optical imaging of blood oxygenation and flow combined with laser speckle imaging of blood flow obtaining a mesoscopic picture of the hemodynamic response (n = 16). Then we obtained corresponding blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI data (n = 5). All measurements could be performed in the same mice in response to identical sensory and optogenetic stimuli. RESULTS: The cranial window did not deteriorate the quality of fMRI and allowed alternation between imaging modalities in each subject. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides a proof of feasibility for multiscale imaging approaches in awake mice. In the future, this protocol could be extended to include complex cognitive behaviors translatable to humans, such as sensory discrimination or attention.

In this study, using a high temporal resolution fMRI data, we examined the way of dynamically visualizing the difference in the activation timing between the brain activation areas by analyzing the task onset time of the statistical model shifted from the actual stimulation timing. Materials and Methods: fMRI data with high temporal resolution was acquired using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging for 10 right-handed healthy volunteers. While being scanned, the volunteers completed a task that comprised two sets of a rest and right hand grip movement task. Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) software was used to analyze fMRI data. After preprocessing, statistical analyses were performed by shifting the task onset time on the statistical model by about 1 second forward or backward from the actual stimulation timing. Activation maps of multiple time phases were then created. Results: Activity was observed to the left of the primary motor area and the supplementary motor area and to the right of the cerebellum (familywise error rate, P < .05). In the right hand grip movement, the primary motor area and the supplementary motor area were activated from 1.12 to 4.48 seconds earlier than the cerebellum. Conclusions: Using this analysis method, we visualized the differences in activation timings of different areas of the brain.

Using rs-fMRI, researchers have extensively studied the organization of the brain functional network and found several consistent communities consisting of functionally connected but spatially separated brain regions across subjects. However, increasing evidence in many disciplines has shown that most realistic complex networks have overlapping community structure. Only recently has the overlapping community structure drawn increasing interest in the domain of brain network studies. Another issue is that the inter-subject variability is often not directly reflected in the process of community detection at the group level. In this paper, we propose a novel method called collective sparse symmetric non-negative matrix factorization (cssNMF) to address these issues. The cssNMF approach identifies the group-level overlapping communities across subjects and in the meantime preserves the information of individual variation in brain functional network organization. To comprehensively validate cssNMF, a simulated fMRI dataset with ground-truth, a real rs-fMRI dataset with two repeated sessions and another different real rs-fMRI dataset have been used for performance comparison in the experiment. Experimental results show that the proposed cssNMF method accurately and stably identifies group-level overlapping communities across subjects as well as individual differences in network organization with neurophysiologically meaningful interpretations. This research extends our understanding of the common underlying community structures and individual differences in community strengths in brain functional network organization.

However, the application of ICA in multi-group designs is not straightforward. We have recently developed a new method named "shared and specific independent component analysis" (SSICA) to perform between-group comparisons in the ICA framework. SSICA is sensitive to extract those components which represent a significant difference in functional connectivity between groups or conditions, i.e., components that could be considered "specific" for a group or condition. Here, we investigated the performance of SSICA on realistic simulations, and task fMRI data and compared the results with one of the state-of-the-art group ICA approaches to infer between-group differences. We examined SSICA robustness with respect to the number of allowable extracted specific components and between-group orthogonality assumptions. Furthermore, we proposed a modified formulation of the back-reconstruction method to generate group-level t-statistics maps based on SSICA results. We also evaluated the consistency and specificity of the extracted specific components by SSICA. The results on realistic simulated and real fMRI data showed that SSICA outperforms the regular group ICA approach in terms of reconstruction and classification performance. We demonstrated that SSICA is a powerful data-driven approach to detect patterns of differences in functional connectivity across groups/conditions, particularly in model-free designs such as resting-state fMRI. Our findings in task fMRI show that SSICA confirms results of the general linear model (GLM) analysis and when combined with clustering analysis, it complements GLM findings by providing additional information regarding the reliability and specificity of networks.

A short, robust brain activation control task optimised for pharmacological fMRI studies	PEERJ			English	Article						Neuroimaging; fMRI; Pharmacological fMRI; phfMRI; Task fMRI; Reliability analysis; Cognitive neuroscience; Psychopharmacology	RETEST RELIABILITY; BALLOON MODEL; POWER FAILURE; BOLD SIGNALS; NEUROSCIENCE; RESPONSES; DISEASE; HUMANS; CORTEX; MRI	Background. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular method for examining pharmacological effects on the brain; however, the BOLD response is dependent on intact neurovascular coupling, and potentially modulated by a number of physiological factors. Pharmacological fMRI is therefore vulnerable to confounding effects of pharmacological probes on general physiology or neurovascular coupling. Controlling for such non-specific effects in pharmacological fMRI studies is therefore an important consideration, and there is an additional need for well-validated fMRI task paradigms that could be used to control for such effects, or for general testing purposes. Methods. We have developed two variants of a standardized control task that are short (5 minutes duration) simple (for both the subject and experimenter), widely applicable, and yield a number of readouts in a spatially diverse set of brain networks. The tasks consist of four functionally discrete three-second trial types (plus additional null trials) and contain visual, auditory, motor and cognitive (eye-movements, and working memory tasks in the two task variants) stimuli. Performance of the tasks was assessed in a group of 15 subjects scanned on two separate occasions, with test-retest reliability explicitly assessed using infra-class correlation coefficients. Results. Both tasks produced robust patterns of brain activation in the expected brain regions, and region of interest-derived reliability coefficients for the tasks were generally high, with four out of eight task conditions rated as 'excellent' or 'good', and only one out of eight rated as 'poor'. Median values in the voxel-wise reliability measures were also >0.7 for all task conditions, and therefore classed as 'excellent' or 'good'. The spatial concordance between the most highly activated voxels and those with the highest reliability coefficients was greater for the sensory (auditory, visual) conditions than the other (motor, cognitive) conditions. Discussion. Either of the two task variants would be suitable for use as a control task in future pharmacological fMRI studies or for any other investigation where a short, reliable, basic task paradigm is required. Stimulus code is available online for re-use by the scientific community.

Moreover, the supervised dictionary learning (SDL) that fixed the task stimulus curves as predefined atoms was proposed to improve ODL for functional networks separation. However, SDL cannot estimate the real time courses underlying the brain networks and cannot be applied to the inter-network connectivity analysis. This study aimed at investigating how to add the temporal prior information to ODL to extract the accurate task-related brain networks and the corresponding time courses. New method: To improve the performance of ODL, we propose a semi-blind ODL (semi-ODL) method that incorporates temporal prior information of the task paradigm into the dictionary updating process and optimizes the direction of one or more specific atoms "close" to the task time courses. Results: Results of the simulated and real fMRI experiment revealed that semi-ODL extracted more accurate task-related component and time courses than ODL and SDL. For one-task fMRI data, semi-ODL and Infomax-ICA showed similar detection power in most cases. Comparison with existing methods: The semi-ODL outperformed ODL, SDL in robustness to noise, spatial detection power and time course estimation. Moreover, semi-ODL showed comparable performance to Infomax-ICA for one-task fMRI data and outperformed Infomax-ICA in extracting the components related to each task from multitask fMRI data. Conclusions: The semi-ODL method is potentially useful to reveal brain networks underlying various cognitive tasks and the interactions between task-related brain networks.

A critical step in the development of marmosets as a viable model for human brain dysfunction is to characterize brain networks that are homologous with human network topologies. In this regard, the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds tremendous potential for functional brain mapping in marmosets. Although possible, implementation of hardware for fMRI in awake marmosets (free of the confounding effects of anesthesia) is not trivial due to the technical challenges associated with developing specialized imaging hardware. Here, we describe the design and implementation of a marmoset holder and head-fixation system with an integrated receive coil for awake marmoset fMRI. This design minimized head motion, with less than 100 mu m of translation and 0.5 degrees of rotation over 15 consecutive resting state fMRI runs (at 15 min each) across 3 different marmosets. The fMRI data was of sufficient quality to reliably extract 8 resting state networks from each animal with only 60-90 min of resting state fMRI acquisition per animal. The restraint system proved to be an efficient and practical solution for securing an awake marmoset and positioning a receive array within minutes, limiting stress to the animal. This design is also amenable for multimodal imaging, allowing for electrode or lens placement above the skull via the open chamber design. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files and engineering drawings are provided as an open resource, with the majority of the parts designed to be 3D printed.

Behavioral interventions for reducing head motion during MRI scans in children	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MRI; Resting state; Motion; Movies; Feedback; Development	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; REAL-TIME MOTION; HUMAN BRAIN; VOLUMETRIC NAVIGATORS; NETWORKS; FMRI; ORGANIZATION; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY; SCALE	A major limitation to structural and functional MRI (fMRI) scans is their susceptibility to head motion artifacts. Even submillimeter movements can systematically distort functional connectivity, morphometric, and diffusion imaging results. In patient care, sedation is often used to minimize head motion, but it incurs increased costs and risks. In research settings, sedation is typically not an ethical option. Therefore, safe methods that reduce head motion are critical for improving MRI quality, especially in high movement individuals such as children and neuropsychiatric patients. We investigated the effects of (1) viewing movies and (2) receiving real-time visual feedback about head movement in 24 children (5-15 years old). Children completed fMRI scans during which they viewed a fixation cross (i.e., rest) or a cartoon movie clip, and during some of the scans they also received real-time visual feedback about head motion. Head motion was significantly reduced during movie watching compared to rest and when receiving feedback compared to receiving no feedback. However, these results depended on age, such that the effects were largely driven by the younger children. Children older than 10 years showed no significant benefit. We also found that viewing movies significantly altered the functional connectivity of fMRI data, suggesting that fMRI scans during movies cannot be equated to standard resting-state fMRI scans. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) given the reduction in head motion with behavioral interventions, these methods should be tried first for all clinical and structural MRIs in lieu of sedation; and (2) for fMRI research scans, these methods can reduce head motion in certain groups, but investigators must keep in mind the effects on functional MRI data.

The default-mode network (DMN) is known to be dysfunctional, although correlation with level of consciousness remains controversial. We investigated DMN activity with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), alongside its structural and metabolic integrity, aiming to elucidate the corresponding associations with clinical assessment. Methods: We enrolled 119 consecutive patients: 72 in a vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness state (VS/UWS), 36 in a minimally conscious state (MCS), and 11 with severe disability. All underwent structural MRI and rs-fMRI, and a subset also underwent F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Data were analyzed with manual and automatic approaches, in relation to diagnosis and clinical score. Results: Excluding the quartile with largest head movement, DMN activity was decreased in VS/UWS compared to MCS, and correlated with clinical score. Independent-component and seed-based analyses provided similar results, although the latter and their combination were most informative. Structural MRI and FDG-PET were less sensitive to head movement and had better diagnostic accuracy than rs-fMRI only when all cases were included. rs-fMRI indicated relatively preserved DMN activity in a small subset of VS/UWS patients, 2 of whom evolved to MCS. The integrity of the left hemisphere appears to be predictive of a better clinical status. Interpretation: rs-fMRI of the DMN is sensitive to clinical severity. The effect is consistent across data analysis approaches, but heavily dependent on head movement. rs-fMRI could be informative in detecting residual DMN activity for those patients who remain relatively still during scanning and whose diagnosis is uncertain.

Here, we propose a layered approach to experimental design in which multiple tasks-from simple to complex-with additional layers of complexity introduced at each stage are incorporated for investigating decision making. This is demonstrated using tasks involving intertemporal choice between immediate and future prospects. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have separately investigated the spatial and temporal neural substrates, respectively, of specific factors underlying decision making. In contrast, we performed simultaneous acquisition of EEG/ fMRI data and fusion of both modalities using joint independent component analysis such that: 1) the native temporal/ spatial resolutions of either modality is not compromised and 2) fast temporal dynamics of decision making as well as involved deeper striatal structures can be characterized. We show that spatiotemporal neural substrates underlying our proposed complex intertemporal task simultaneously incorporating rewards, costs, and uncertainty of future outcomes can be predicted (using a linear model) from neural substrates of each of these factors, which were separately obtained by simpler tasks. This was not the case for spatial and temporal features obtained separately from fMRI and EEG, respectively. However, certain prefrontal activations in the complex task could not be predicted from activations in simpler tasks, indicating that the assumption of pure insertion has limited validity. Overall, our approach provides a realistic and novel framework for investigating the neural substrates of decision making with high spatiotemporal resolution.

J	Yan, WJ; Rangaprakash, D; Deshpande, G				Yan, Wenjing; Rangaprakash, D.; Deshpande, Gopikrishna			Aberrant hemodynamic responses in autism: Implications for resting state fMRI functional connectivity studies	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Resting-state fMRI; Deconvolution; Autism; Hemodynamic response function (HRF); HRF variability; Seed-based functional connectivity	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT MODE; BOLD SIGNAL; DECONVOLUTION; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS; CORTEX; MRI; AMPLITUDE; SOLDIERS	Functional MRI (fMRI) is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and an unmeasured latent neural signal. However, HRF itself is variable across brain regions and subjects. This variability is induced by both neural and non-neural factors. Aberrations in underlying neurochemical mechanisms, which control HRF shape, have been reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therefore, we hypothesized that this will lead to voxel-specific, yet systematic differences in HRF shape between ASD and healthy controls. As a corollary, we also hypothesized that such alterations will lead to differences in estimated functional connectivity in fMRI space compared to latent neural space. To test these hypotheses, we performed blind deconvolution of resting-state fMRI time series acquired from large number of ASD and control subjects obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database (N = 1102). Many brain regions previously implicated in autism showed systematic differences in HRF shape in ASD. Specifically, we found that precuneus had aberrations in all HRF parameters. Consequently, we obtained precuneus-seed-based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls using fMRI as well as using latent neural signals. We found that non-deconvolved fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity between precuneus and certain brain regions that were instead observed in deconvolved data. Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD, as well as have methodological implications for resting-state functional connectivity studies in Autism, and more generally in disorders that are accompanied by neurochemical alterations that may impact HRF shape.

We recorded concurrent fNIRS with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to investigate the group-level correspondence of these measures with source-localized fNIRS estimates. Healthy participants took part in both a concurrent fNIRS-MEG and fNIRS-fMRI neuroimaging session during two somatosensory stimulation tasks, a blocked design median nerve localizer and parametric pulsed-pair median nerve stimulation using interpulse intervals from 100 to 500 ms. We found the spatial correlation for estimated activation patterns from the somatosensory task was R = 0.54, 0.57, and -0.48 and the amplitude correlation was R = 0.80, 0.52, and -0.70 for fMRI-MEG, fMRI-fNIRS oxy-hemoglobin, and fMRI-fNIRS deoxy-hemoglobin signals, respectively. Taken together, these results show good correspondence among the fMRI, fNIRS, and MEG with the great majority of the difference across modalities being driven by lower sensitivity for deeper brain sources in MEG and fNIRS. These results provide an important validation of source-localized fNIRS in the context of concurrent multimodal imaging for future studies of the relationship between physiological effects in the human brain.

A speech articulation network (SAN) has been observed in multiple brain studies typically using either neuroimaging or direct electrical stimulation (DES), thus giving limited knowledge about the whole brain structural and functional organization of this network. In this study, seven right-handed patients underwent awake surgery resection of low-grade gliomas (4) and cavernous angiomas. We combined pre-surgical resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI together with speech arrest sites obtained intra-operatively with DES to address the following goals: (i) determine the cortical areas contributing to the intrinsic functional SAN using the speech arrest sites as functional seeds for rs-fMRI; (ii) evaluate the relative contribution of gray matter terminations from the two major language dorsal stream bundles, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF III) and the arcuate fasciculus (AF); and (iii) evaluate the possible pre-surgical prediction of SAN with rs-fMRI. In all these right-handed patients the intrinsic functional SAN included frontal, inferior parietal, temporal, and insular regions symmetrically and bilaterally distributed across the two hemispheres regardless of the side (four right) of speech arrest evocation. The SLF III provided a much higher density of terminations in the cortical regions of SAN in respect to AF. Pre-surgical rs-fMRI data demonstrated moderate ability to predict the SAN. The set of functional and structural data provided in this multimodal study characterized, at a whole-brain level, a distributed and bi-hemispherical network subserving speech articulation.

These include the spatial scale of the columnar pattern, the point-spread of the fMRI response, the voxel size, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) considering thermal and physiological noise. However, it remains unknown how these factors combine, and what is the voxel size that optimizes fMRI of cortical columns. Here we combine current knowledge into a quantitative model of fMRI of realistic patterns of cortical columns with different spatial scales and degrees of irregularity. We compare different approaches for identifying patterns of cortical columns, including univariate and multivariate based detection, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) based decoding, and high-resolution imaging and reconstruction of the pattern of cortical columns. We present the dependence of the performance of each approach on the parameters of the imaged pattern as well as those of the data acquisition. In addition, we predict voxel sizes that optimize fMRI of cortical columns under various scenarios. We found that all measures associated with multivariate detection and decoding could be approximately calculated from a measure we termed "multivariate contrast-to-noise ratio" (mv-CNR), which is a function of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and number of voxels. Furthermore, mv-CNR implied that the optimal voxel width for detection and decoding is independent of changes in response amplitude, SNR and imaged volume that are not caused by changes in voxel size. For regular patterns, optimal voxel widths for detection, decoding and imaging/reconstructing the pattern of cortical columns were approximately half the main cycle length of the organization. Optimal voxel widths for irregular patterns were less dependent on the main cycle length, and differed between univariate detection, multivariate detection and decoding, and reconstruction. We compared the effects of different factors of Gradient Echo fMRI at 3 Tesla (T), Gradient Echo fMRI at 7T, and Spin-Echo fMRI at 7T on the detection, decoding, and reconstruction measures considered and found that in all cases the width of the fMRI point-spread had the most significant effect. In contrast, different response amplitudes and noise characteristics played a relatively minor role. We recommend specific voxel widths for optimal univariate detection, for multivariate detection and decoding, and for high-resolution imaging of cortical columns under these three data-acquisition scenarios. Our study supports the planning, optimization, and interpretation of high-resolution fMRI of cortical columns and the decoding of information conveyed by these columns.

Current approaches for studying dynamic connectivity often rely on ad hoc approaches for inference, with the fMRI time courses segmented by a sequence of sliding windows. We propose a principled Bayesian approach to dynamic functional connectivity, which is based on the estimation of time varying networks. Our method utilizes a hidden Markov model for classification of latent cognitive states, achieving estimation of the networks in an integrated framework that borrows strength over the entire time course of the experiment. Furthermore, we assume that the graph structures, which define the connectivity states at each time point, are related within a super-graph, to encourage the selection of the same edges among related graphs. We apply our method to simulated task -based fMRI data, where we show how our approach allows the decoupling of the task-related activations and the functional connectivity states. We also analyze data from an fMRI sensorimotor task experiment on an individual healthy subject and obtain results that support the role of particular anatomical regions in modulating interaction between executive control and attention networks.

In previous studies, dfMRI showed higher spatial accuracy at activation mapping compared to classic functional MRI approaches. However, it remains unclear whether dfMRI measures result from changes in the intracellular/extracellular environment, perfusion, and/or T-2 values. We designed an acquisition/quantification scheme to disentangle such effects in the motor cortex during a finger-tapping paradigm. dfMRI was acquired at specific diffusion weightings to selectively suppress perfusion and free-water diffusion, then time series of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC-fMRI) and of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) effects were derived. ADC-fMRI provided ADC estimates sensitive to changes in perfusion and free-water volume, but not to T-2/T-2* values. With IVIM modeling, we isolated the perfusion contribution to ADC, while suppressing T-2 effects. Compared to conventional gradient-echo blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI, activation maps obtained with dfMRI and ADC-fMRI had smaller clusters, and the spatial overlap between the three techniques was below 50%. Increases of perfusion fractions were observed during task in both dfMRI and ADC-fMRI activations. Perfusion effects were more prominent with ADC-fMRI than with dfMRI but were significant in less than 25% of activation regions. IVIM modeling suggests that the sensitivity to task of dfMRI derives from a decrease of intracellular/extracellular diffusion and an increase of the pseudo-diffusion signal fraction, leading to different, more confined spatial activation patterns compared to classic functional MRI.

FMRI response to acute psychological stress differentiates patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures from healthy controls - A biochemical and neuroimaging biomarker study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES); fMRI; Cortisol; Alpha-amylase; Psychological stress; Emotion	SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE; ACUTE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; CONVERSION DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTISOL; EMOTION; REACTIVITY; TRAUMA; MODULATION; DEPRESSION	We investigated psychological stress response in the brain regions involved in emotion-motor-executive control in psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). 12 PNES patients and 12 healthy controls (HCs) underwent stress task and resting state functional MRI (fMRI), mood and quality of life (QOL) assessments, and measurements of salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase, and heart rate. Group differences were assessed, and we correlated beta values from a priori selected brain regions showing stress task fMRI group differences with other stress response measures. We also used the regions showing stress task fMRI group differences as seeds for resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis. Mood and QOL were worse in PNES versus HCs. Physiological and assessment measures were similar except 'Manful Problem Solving' coping that was greater for HCs (p = .043). Perceived stress associated negatively with heart rate change (r(s) = - 0.74, p = .0063). There was stress fMRI hyporeactivity in left/right amygdala and left hippocampus in PNES versus HCs (corrected p < .05). PNES exhibited a positive association between alpha-amylase change and right amygdala activation (r(s) = 0.71, p = .010). PNES versus HCs exhibited greater right amygdala rs-FC to left precentral and inferior/middle frontal gyri (corrected p < .05). Our findings of fMRI hyporeactivity to psychological stress, along with greater emotion-motor-executive control network rs-FC in PNES when compared to HCs suggest a dysregulation in stress response circuitry in PNES.

Literature has shown that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) at 1 Hz can significantly relieve migraine symptoms. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the neural pathways associated with taVNS treatment of migraine. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with migraine were recruited from outpatient neurology clinics. Each patient attended two magnetic resonance imaging/functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/fMRI) scan sessions separated by one week. Each session included a pre-stimulation resting state fMRI scan, fMRI scans during real or sham 1 Hz taVNS (with block design), and a post-stimulation resting state fMRI scan. Results: Twenty-six patients were included in the final analyses. Real taVNS evoked fMRI signal decreases in brain areas belonging to the default mode network (DMN) and brain stem areas including the locus coeruleus (LC), raphe nuclei, parabrachial nucleus, and solitary nucleus. Sham taVNS evoked fMRI signal decreases in brain areas belonging to the DMN. Compared to sham taVNS, real taVNS produced greater deactivation at the bilateral LC. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis showed that after taVNS, LC rsFC with the right temporoparietal junction and left secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) significantly increased compared to sham taVNS. The increased rsFC of the left LC-left S2 was significantly negatively associated with the frequency of migraine attacks during the preceding month. Conclusion: Our results suggest that taVNS at 1 Hz can significantly modulate activity/connectivity of brain regions associated with the vagus nerve central pathway and pain modulation system, which may shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying taVNS treatment of migraine.

Nonetheless, several studies found no differences in network processing between tinnitus patients and healthy controls (HCs). Its neural bases are poorly understood. To identify aberrant brain network architecture involved in chronic tinnitus, we compared the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) patterns of tinnitus patients and HCs. Materials and Methods: Chronic tinnitus patients (n = 24) with normal hearing thresholds and age-, sex-, education- and hearing threshold-matched HCs (n = 22) participated in the current study and underwent the rs-fMRI scanning. We used degree centrality (DC) to investigate functional connectivity (FC) strength of the whole-brain network and Granger causality to analyze effective connectivity in order to explore directional aspects involved in tinnitus. Results: Compared to HCs, we found significantly increased network centrality in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Unidirectionally, the left SFG revealed increased effective connectivity to the left middle orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left posterior lobe of cerebellum (PLC), left postcentral gyrus, and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) while the right SFG exhibited enhanced effective connectivity to the right supplementary motor area (SMA). In addition, the effective connectivity from the bilateral SFG to the OFC and SMA showed positive correlations with tinnitus distress. Conclusions: Rs-fMRI provides a new and novel method for identifying aberrant brain network architecture. Chronic tinnitus patients have disrupted FC strength and causal connectivity mostly in non-auditory regions, especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The current findings will provide a new perspective for understanding the neuropathophysiological mechanisms in chronic tinnitus.

Classic electromagnetic muscle vibrators, however, cannot be used in the high-strength magnetic field of the fMRI scanner. Pneumatic vibrators offer an fMRI-compatible alternative. However, whether these devices produce reliable and valid proprioceptive stimuli has not been investigated, although this is essential for these devices to be used in longitudinal research. Test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the postural response to muscle vibration, provided by custom-made fMRI-compatible pneumatic vibrators, were assessed in a repeated-measures design. Mean center of pressure (CoP) displacements during, respectively, ankle muscle and back muscle vibration (45-60 Hz, 0.5 mm) provided by an electromagnetic and a pneumatic vibrator were measured in ten young healthy subjects. The test was repeated on the same day and again within one week. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess (a) intra-and interday reliability of the postural responses to, respectively, pneumatic and electromagnetic vibration, and (b) concurrent validity of the response to pneumatic compared to electromagnetic vibration. Test-retest reliability of mean CoP displacements during pneumatic vibration was good to excellent (ICCs = 0.64-0.90) and resembled that of responses to electromagnetic vibration (ICCs = 0.64-0.94). Concurrent validity of the postural effect of pneumatic vibration was good to excellent (ICCs = 0.63-0.95). In conclusion, the proposed fMRI-compatible pneumatic vibrator can be used with confidence to stimulate muscle spindles during fMRI to study central processing of proprioception.

One candidate method that offers insights into the brain's functional connectivity (FC) is resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). In both humans and nonhuman primates, patterns of FC (often referred to as the functional connectome) have been related to the underlying structural connectivity (SC; also called the structural connectome). Given the recent rise in preclinical neuroimaging of mouse models, it is an important question whether the mouse functional connectome conforms to the underlying SC. Here, we compared FC derived from rs-fMRI in female mice with the underlying monosynaptic structural connectome as provided by the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas. We show that FC between interhemispheric homotopic cortical and hippocampal areas, as well as in cortico-striatal pathways, emerges primarily via monosynaptic structural connections. In particular, we demonstrate that the striatum (STR) can be segregated according to differential rs-fMRI connectivity patterns that mirror monosynaptic connectivity with isocortex. In contrast, for certain subcortical networks, FC emerges along polysynaptic pathways as shown for left and right STR, which do not share direct anatomical connections, but high FC is putatively driven by a top-down cortical control. Finally, we show that FC involving cortico-thalamic pathways is limited, possibly confounded by the effect of anesthesia, small regional size, and tracer injection volume. These findings provide a critical foundation for using rs-fMRI connectivity as a translational tool to study complex brain circuitry interactions and their pathology due to neurological or psychiatric diseases across species.

It notably plays a central role in motor control, as spinal motoneurons activate skeletal muscles involved in voluntary movements. Yet, the spinal mechanisms underlying human movement generation have not been completely elucidated. In this regard, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) represents a potential tool to probe spinal cord function non-invasively and with high spatial resolution. Nonetheless, a thorough characterization of this approach is still lacking, currently limiting its impact. Here, we aimed at systematically quantifying to which extent fMRI can reveal spinal cord activity along the rostrocaudal direction. We investigated changes in the blood oxygenation level dependent signal of the human cervical spinal cord during bimanual upper limb movements (wrist extension, wrist adduction and finger abduction) in nineteen healthy volunteers. Prior to scanning, we recorded the muscle activity associated with these movements in order to reconstruct the theoretical motor-pool output pattern using an anatomy-based mapping of the electromyographic (EMG) waveforms. EMG-derived spinal maps were characterized by distinct rostrocaudal patterns of activation, thus confirming the task-specific features of the different movements. Analogous activation patterns were captured using spinal cord fMRI. Finally, an additional fMRI dataset was acquired from a subset of the participants (n = 6) to deploy a multivoxel pattern analysis, which allowed successful decoding of movements. These combined results suggest that spinal cord fMRI can be used to image rostrocaudal activation patterns reflecting the underlying activity of the motoneuron pools innervating the task-related muscles. Spinal cord fMRI offers the prospect of a novel tool to study motor processes and potentially their modification following neurological motor disorders.

New method: Multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) is a state-space method for estimating dynamic causal interactions in fMRI data. Here we validate MDS using benchmark simulations as well as simulations from a more realistic stochastic neurophysiological model. Finally, we applied MDS to investigate dynamic casual interactions in a fronto-cingulate-parietal control network using human connectome project (HCP) data acquired during performance of a working memory task. Crucially, since the ground truth in experimental data is unknown, we conducted novel stability analysis to determine robust causal interactions within this network. Results: MDS accurately recovered dynamic causal interactions with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) above 0.7 for benchmark datasets and AUC above 0.9 for datasets generated using the neurophysiological model. In experimental fMRI data, bootstrap procedures revealed a stable pattern of causal influences from the anterior insula to other nodes of the fronto-cingulate-parietal network. Comparison with existing methods: MDS is effective in estimating dynamic causal interactions in both the benchmark and neurophysiological model based datasets in terms of AUC, sensitivity and false positive rates. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that MDS can accurately estimate causal interactions in fMRI data. Neurophysiological models and stability analysis provide a general framework for validating computational methods designed to estimate causal interactions in fMRI. The right anterior insula functions as a causal hub during working memory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, with improvements in gradient and radiofrequency coils and advances in pulse sequence designs, functional images with higher spatiotemporal resolution can be achieved. However, while smaller voxel size has the benefit of resolving finer brain structures, it also decreases voxel-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, subsequently, temporal SNR (tSNR), which is critical for the sensitivity of fMRI. Although the improved temporal resolution allows more image frames to be collected per unit time, the ability to detect brain activity by using the high spatiotemporal fMRI has not been fully characterized. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of spatial smoothing, scan length, sample size, seed size, and location on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and tSNR by using data from the human connectome project. Results from this analysis show an important effect of smoothing on the rsFC strength (correlation values between the seed and the target) as well as on the tSNR. In contrast, while rsFC strength is not affected by sample size, the standard error decreases with the increasing number of participants, therefore improving the detection power for larger samples. Scan length and seed size seem to have a moderate effect on rsFC strength. Finally, seed location has an important impact on rsFC maps, as rsFC strength from cortical seeds seems higher than from sub-cortical seeds. In summary, our findings show that the choice of parameters can be critical for an rsfMRI study.

Compared to block design fMRI signals, classification of the response to a single or a few stimulus trial(s) is not a trivial problem due to contamination by preceding events as well as the low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome such problems, we proposed a single trial-based classification method of rapid event-related fMRI signals utilizing sparse multivariate Bayesian decoding of spatio-temporal fMRI responses. We applied the proposed method to classification of memory retrieval processes for two different classes of episodic memories: a voluntarily conducted experience and a passive experience induced by watching a video of others' actions. A cross-validation showed higher classification performance of the proposed method compared to that of a support vector machine or of a classifier based on the general linear model. Evaluation of classification performances for one, two, and three stimuli from the same class and a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and target stimulus positions among trials suggest that presenting two target stimuli at longer inter-stimulus intervals is optimal in the design of classification experiments to identify the target stimuli. The proposed method for decoding subject-specific memory retrieval of voluntary behavior using fMRI would be useful in forensic applications in a natural environment, where many known trials can be extracted from a simulation of everyday tasks and few target stimuli from a crime scene.

Several studies have proposed that the anticorrelation originates from a causal link between changes in the alpha power and BOLD signal. However, the results in this study reveal that fluctuations in alpha and BOLD power do not generate one another but instead respectively result from high- and low-frequency components of the same underlying cortical activity, and that they are inversely correlated via variations in the strengths of corticothalamic and intrathalamic feedback, thereby explaining their anticorrelation.

The PhysIO Toolbox for Modeling Physiological Noise in fMRI Data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Physiological noise correction fMRI; RETROICOR; RVHRCOR; Heart rate; Respiratory volume; SPM toolbox; fMRI preprocessing	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RESTING-STATE FMRI; DECISION-MAKING; HEART-RATE; BOLD; BRAIN; ACQUISITION; SIGNAL; FLUCTUATIONS; RESPIRATION	Background: Physiological noise is one of the major confounds for fMRI. A common class of correction methods model noise from peripheral measures, such as ECGs or pneumatic belts. However, physiological noise correction has not emerged as a standard preprocessing step for fMRI data yet due to: (1) the varying data quality of physiological recordings, (2) non-standardized peripheral data formats and (3) the lack of full automatization of processing and modeling physiology, required for large-cohort studies. New methods: We introduce the PhysIO Toolbox for preprocessing of physiological recordings and model based noise correction. It implements a variety of noise models, such as RETROICOR, respiratory volume per time and heart rate variability responses (RVT/HRV). The toolbox covers all intermediate steps from flexible read-in of data formats to GLM regressor/contrast creation without any manual intervention. Results: We demonstrate the workflow of the toolbox and its functionality for datasets from different vendors, recording devices, field strengths and subject populations. Automatization of physiological noise correction and performance evaluation are reported in a group study (N=35). Comparison with existing methods: The PhysIO Toolbox reproduces physiological noise patterns and correction efficacy of previously implemented noise models. It increases modeling robustness by outperforming vendor-provided peak detection methods for physiological cycles. Finally, the toolbox offers an integrated framework with full automatization, including performance monitoring, and flexibility with respect to the input data. Conclusions: Through its platform-independent Matlab implementation, open-source distribution, and modular structure, the PhysIO Toolbox renders physiological noise correction an accessible preprocessing step for fMRI data.

It has been reported that, among the electrophysiological oscillations, those in the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz) are the most dominant during resting state. We hypothesized that DMN spatial configuration closely depends on the specific neuronal oscillations considered, and that alpha oscillations would mainly correlate with increased blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the DMN. To test this hypothesis, we used high-density EEG (hdEEG) data simultaneously collected with fMRI scanning in 20 healthy volunteers at rest. We first detected the DMN from source reconstructed hdEEG data for multiple frequency bands, and we then mapped the correlation between temporal profile of hdEEG-derived DMN activity and fMRI-BOLD signals on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the correlation map associated with alpha oscillations, more than with any other frequency bands, displayed a larger overlap with DMN regions. Overall, our study provided further evidence for a primary role of alpha oscillations in supporting DMN functioning. We suggest that simultaneous EEG-fMRI may represent a powerful tool to investigate the neurophysiological basis of human brain networks.

Predicting haemodynamic networks using electrophysiology: The role of non-linear and cross-frequency interactions	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI; Functional connectivity; Resting state network; RSN; Relationship between fMRI and MEG; Mapping; Multivariate Taylor series	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; BOLD FMRI; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; TASK; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Understanding the electrophysiological basis of resting state networks (RSNs) in the human brain is a critical step towards elucidating how inter-areal connectivity supports healthy brain function. In recent years, the relationship between RSNs (typically measured using haemodynamic signals) and electrophysiology has been explored using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Significant progress has been made, with similar spatial structure observable in both modalities. However, there is a pressing need to understand this relationship beyond simple visual similarity of RSN patterns. Here, we introduce a mathematical model to predict fMRI-based RSNs using MEG. Our unique model, based upon a multivariate Taylor series, incorporates both phase and amplitude based MEG connectivity metrics, as well as linear and non-linear interactions within and between neural oscillations measured in multiple frequency bands. We show that including non-linear interactions, multiple frequency bands and cross-frequency terms significantly improves fMRI network prediction. This shows that fMRI connectivity is not only the result of direct electrophysiological connections, but is also driven by the overlap of connectivity profiles between separate regions. Our results indicate that a complete understanding of the electrophysiological basis of RSNs goes beyond simple frequency-specific analysis, and further exploration of non-linear and cross-frequency interactions will shed new light on distributed network connectivity, and its perturbation in pathology.

This period before mild cognitive impairment is present has been referred to as preclinical AD, and is thought to begin with amyloid-beta deposition and then progress to neurodegeneration and functional brain circuit alterations. Prior studies have shown that there is increased medial temporal lobe activation on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) early in the course of mild cognitive impairment. It is unknown, however, whether this altered fMRI activity precedes cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study is to address this question using Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) imaging and fMRI in a sample of cognitively normal older adults. Methods: Forty-four cognitively normal older adults underwent both PiB imaging and fMRI with a face-name memory task: 21 were classified as PiB(+) and 23 were PiB(-). Additionally, thorough cognitive and neuropsychological test batteries were administered outside the scanner. The main outcome measure in this study is fMRI activation in the medial temporal lobe during a face-name memory-encoding task. Results: PiB(+) subjects showed higher fMRI activation during the memory task in the hippocampus relative to PiB(-) participants. Conclusions: The increased medial temporal lobe activation in preclinical AD, observed in this study, may serve as an early biomarker of neurodegeneration. Future studies are needed to clarify whether this functional biomarker can stratify AD risk among PiB(+) older adults.

Surgery for gliomas and epilepsy requires precise localization for resection due to the need to preserve (or perhaps improve) higher cognitive functions. Accordingly, a hodological approach should be taken that considers subcortical networks as well as cortical functions within various functional domains. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to provide new insights that are valuable for this approach. In this review, we describe recent developments in network analysis using resting state fMRI related to factors in glioma and epilepsy surgery: the identification of functionally dominant areas, evaluation of cognitive function by alteration of resting state networks (RSNs), glioma grading, and epileptic focus detection. One particular challenge that is close to realization is using fMRI for the identification of sensorimotor-and language-dominant areas during a task-free resting state. Various RSNs representative of the default mode network demonstrated at least some alterations in both patient groups, which correlated with behavioral changes including cognition, memory, and attention, and the development of psychosis. Still challenging is the detection of epileptic foci and propagation pathways when using only network analysis with resting state fMRI; however, a combined method with simultaneous electroencephalography has produced promising results. Consequently, network analysis is expected to continue to advance as neuroimaging technology improves in the next decade, and preoperative evaluation for neurosurgical parameters through these techniques should improve parallel with them.

We studied BOLD fMRI activation and cerebrovascular reactivity in moyamoya disease. To characterize the impact of remote vascular demands on BOLD fMRI measurements, we varied the vascular territories engaged by manipulating the experimental task performed by the participants. Vascular territories affected by disease were identified using BOLD cerebrovascular reactivity. Preliminary evidence from two patients pre- and postrevascularization surgery and four controls indicates that neurovascular coupling in affected brain regions can be modulated by the task-related vascular demands in unaffected regions. In one patient studied, we observed that brain regions with improved cerebrovascular reactivity after surgery demonstrated normalized neurovascular coupling, that is the degree to which neurovascular coupling was modulated by task-related vascular demands was decreased. We propose that variations in task-dependent neurovascular coupling in patients with moyamoya disease are likely related to vascular steal. While preliminary, our findings are a proof of concept of the limitations of BOLD fMRI in cerebrovascular disease and suggest a role for assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity to improve interpretation of task-related BOLD fMRI activation.

A pilot study, which compares both DOT and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) volumes through t-maps given by canonical statistical parametric mapping (SPM) processing for both data modalities, is presented. The DOT series were processed using a method that is based on a Bayesian filter application on raw DOT data to remove physiological changes and minimum description length application index to select a number of singular values, which reduce the data dimensionality during image reconstruction and adaptation of DOT volume series to normalized standard space. Therefore, statistical analysis is performed with canonical SPM software in the same way as fMRI analysis is done, accepting DOT volumes as if they were fMRI volumes. The results show the reproducibility and ruggedness of the method to process DOT series on group analysis using cognitive paradigms on the prefrontal cortex. Difficulties such as the fact that scalp-brain distances vary between subjects or cerebral activations are difficult to reproduce due to strategies used by the subjects to solve arithmetic problems are considered. T-images given by fMRI and DOT volume series analyzed in SPM show that at the functional level, both DOT and fMRI measures detect the same areas, although DOT provides complementary information to fMRI signals about cerebral activity.

Brain regions implicated in inhibitory control and appetite regulation are activated in response to food portion size and energy density in children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article							HIGH-CALORIE FOODS; NORMAL-WEIGHT; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURONAL RESPONSE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OBESE CHILDREN; BITE SIZE; CUES; REWARD	OBJECTIVE: Large portions of energy-dense foods drive energy intake but the brain mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. Our main objective was to investigate brain function in response to food images varied by portion size (PS) and energy density (ED) in children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS AND DESIGN: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was completed in 36 children (ages 7-10 years) after a 2-h fast while viewing food images at two levels of PS (Large PS, Small PS) and two levels of ED (High ED, Low ED). Children rated perceived fullness pre- and post-fMRI, as well as liking of images on visual analog scales post-fMRI. Anthropometrics were completed 4 weeks before the fMRI. Large PS vs Small PS and High ED vs Low ED were compared with region-of-interest analyses using Brain Voyager v 2.8. RESULTS: Region-of-interest analyses revealed that activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (P = 0.03) was greater for Large PS vs Small PS. Activation was reduced for High ED vs Low ED in the left hypothalamus (P = 0.03). Main effects were no longer significant after adjustment for pre-fMRI fullness and liking ratings (PS, P = 0.92; ED, P = 0.58). CONCLUSION: This is the first fMRI study to report increased activation to large portions in a brain region that is involved in inhibitory control. These findings may contribute to understanding why some children overeat when presented with large portions of palatable food.	[English, L. K.; Fearnbach, S.

J	Sockeel, S; Schwartz, D; Pélégrini-Issac, M; Benali, H				Sockeel, Stephane; Schwartz, Denis; Pelegrini-Issac, Melanie; Benali, Habib			Large-Scale Functional Networks Identified from Resting-State EEG Using Spatial ICA	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FMRI; DISEASE; MEG	Several methods have been applied to EEG or MEG signals to detect functional networks. In recent works using MEG/EEG and fMRI data, temporal ICA analysis has been used to extract spatial maps of resting-state networks with or without an atlas-based parcellation of the cortex. Since the links between the fMRI signal and the electromagnetic signals are not fully established, and to avoid any bias, we examined whether EEG alone was able to derive the spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of functional networks. To do so, we propose a two-step original method: 1) An individual multi-frequency data analysis including EEG-based source localisation and spatial independent component analysis, which allowed us to characterize the resting-state networks. 2) A group-level analysis involving a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify reproducible large-scale networks across the population. Compared with large-scale resting-state networks obtained with fMRI, the proposed EEG-based analysis revealed smaller independent networks thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG, hence hierarchical organization of networks. The comparison showed a substantial overlap between EEG and fMRI networks in motor, premotor, sensory, frontal, and parietal areas. However, there were mismatches between EEG-based and fMRI-based networks in temporal areas, presumably resulting from a poor sensitivity of fMRI in these regions or artefacts in the EEG signals. The proposed method opens the way for studying the high temporal dynamics of networks at the source level thanks to the high temporal resolution of EEG. It would then become possible to study detailed measures of the dynamics of connectivity.

Differences Between Schizophrenic and Normal Subjects Using Network Properties from fMRI	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						fMRI; Machine learning; Schizophrenia; Network properties	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION; REGION	Schizophrenia has been proposed to result from impairment of functional connectivity. We aimed to use machine learning to distinguish schizophrenic subjects from normal controls using a publicly available functional MRI (fMRI) data set. Global and local parameters of functional connectivity were extracted for classification. We found decreased global and local network connectivity in subjects with schizophrenia, particularly in the anterior right cingulate cortex, the superior right temporal region, and the inferior left parietal region as compared to healthy subjects. Using support vector machine and 10-fold cross-validation, nine features reached 92.1% prediction accuracy, respectively. Our results suggest that there are significant differences between control and schizophrenic subjects based on regional brain activity detected with fMRI.

We investigated whether replay of nonspatial sequences can be detected noninvasively in the human hippocampus. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while resting after performing a decision-making task with sequential structure. Hippocampal fMRI patterns recorded at rest reflected sequentiality of previously experienced task states, with consecutive patterns corresponding to nearby states. Hippocampal sequentiality correlated with the fidelity of task representations recorded in the orbitofrontal cortex during decision-making, which were themselves related to better task performance. Our findings suggest that hippocampal replay may be important for building representations of complex, abstract tasks elsewhere in the brain and establish feasibility of investigating fast replay signals with fMRI.

Functional Connectivity of Brain Regions According to Resting State fMRI: Differences between Healthy and Depressed Subjects and Variability of the Results	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						depression; resting state fMRI; functional connectivity; connectivity between regions of interest; reliability of fMRI data	SUBCLINICAL DEPRESSION; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT MODE	In depressed patients, changes in spontaneous brain activity, in particular, the strength of functional connectivity between different regions are observed. The data on changes in the synchrony of different regions of interest in the brain can serve as markers of depressive symptoms and as the targets for the corresponding therapy. The study involved 21 patients with mild depression and 21 healthy volunteers; by the time of second fMRI scanning, 15 and 19 subjects, respectively). The subjects underwent two 4-min sessions of resting state fMRI with 2-4 months interval between the recordings; on the basis of these data, functional connectivity between regions of interest was assessed. During the first session, depressed patients demonstrated more pronounced connection between the right frontal eye field and cerebellar area III. When the sample was restricted to subjects who underwent both fMRI sessions, depressed patients demonstrated closer relations of the right parietal operculum and cerebellar vermis area VIII. During the second recording, healthy subjects showed stronger connectivity between more than 20 frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions of interest and cerebellum area II. In healthy participants, brainstem functional interactions increased from the first to the second fMRI-recording. In depressed subjects a number of cortical areas split from left intraparietal sulcus, but the left temporal cortex became more intra-connected. The results confirm the differences in functional connectivity between depressed and healthy subjects. At the same time, attention should be paid to the variability of the data obtained.

Steven			Quantifying learning-dependent changes in the brain: Single-trial multivoxel pattern analysis requires slow event-related fMRI	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Single-trial fMRI; Multivoxel pattern analysis; Representational similarity analysis; Associative learning; Aversive conditioning	SIMILARITY; ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; INFORMATION; DESIGNS	Single-trial analysis is particularly useful for assessing cognitive processes that are intrinsically dynamic, such as learning. Studying these processes with fMRI is problematic, as the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI requires the averaging over multiple trials, obscuring trial-by-trial changes in neural activation. The superior sensitivity of multivoxel pattern analysis over univariate analyses has opened up new possibilities for single-trial analysis, but this may require different fMRI designs. Here, we measured fMRI and pupil dilation responses during discriminant aversive conditioning, to assess associative learning in a trial-by-trial manner. The impact of design choices was examined by varying trial spacing and trial order in a series of five experiments (total n = 66), while keeping stimulus duration constant (4.5 s). Our outcome measure was the change in similarity between neural response patterns related to two consecutive presentations of the same stimulus (within-stimulus) and between patterns related to pairs of different stimuli (between-stimulus) that shared a specific outcome (electric stimulation vs. no consequence). This trial-by-trial similarity analysis revealed clear single-trial learning curves in conditions with intermediate (8.1-12.6 s) and long (16.5-18.4 s) intervals, with effects being strongest in designs with long intervals and counterbalanced stimulus presentation. No learning curves were observed in designs with shorter intervals (1.6-6.1 s), indicating that rapid event-related designs-at present, the most common designs in fMRI research-are not suited for single-trial pattern analysis. These findings emphasize the importance of deciding on the type of analysis prior to data collection.

Reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF) for EEG artifact reduction in simultaneous EEG-fMRI	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; EEG artifact reduction; reference layer cap; adaptive filtering; reference layer adaptive filtering; multi band reference layer adaptive filtering	BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACT; GRADIENT ARTIFACT; PULSE ARTIFACT; CONCURRENT FMRI; MR SCANNER; REMOVAL; MOTION; RECORDINGS; QUALITY; CLASSIFICATION	Objective. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combines advantages of both methods, namely high temporal resolution of EEG and high spatial resolution of fMRI. However, EEG quality is limited due to severe artifacts caused by fMRI scanners. Approach. To improve EEG data quality substantially, we introduce methods that use a reusable reference layer EEG cap prototype in combination with adaptive filtering. The first method, reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF), uses adaptive filtering with reference layer artifact data to optimize artifact subtraction from EEG. In the second method, multi band reference layer adaptive filtering (MBRLAF), adaptive filtering is performed on bandwidth limited sub-bands of the EEG and the reference channels. Main results. The results suggests that RLAF outperforms the baseline method, average artifact subtraction, in all settings and also its direct predecessor, reference layer artifact subtraction (RLAS), in lower (< 35 Hz) frequency ranges. MBRLAF is computationally more demanding than RLAF, but highly effective in all EEG frequency ranges. Effectivity is determined by visual inspection, as well as root-mean-square voltage reduction and power reduction of EEG provided that physiological EEG components such as occipital EEG alpha power and visual evoked potentials (VEP) are preserved. We demonstrate that both, RLAF and MBRLAF, improve VEP quality. For that, we calculate the mean-squared-distance of single trial VEP to the mean VEP and estimate single trial VEP classification accuracies. We found that the average mean-squared-distance is lowest and the average classification accuracy is highest after MBLAF. RLAF was second best. Significance. In conclusion, the results suggests that RLAF and MBRLAF are potentially very effective in improving EEG quality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Highlights We present a new and reusable reference layer cap prototype for simultaneous EEG-fMRI We introduce new algorithms for reducing EEG artifacts due to simultaneous fMRI The algorithms combine a reference layer and adaptive filtering Several evaluation criteria suggest superior effectivity in terms of artifact reduction We demonstrate that physiological EEG components are preserved	[Steyrl, David; Mueller-Putz, Gernot R.] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Neural Engn, Lab Brain Comp Interfaces, Graz, Austria; [Krausz, Gunther; Edlinger, Guenter] GUGER TECHNOL OG, Graz, Austria; [Koschutnig, Karl] Graz Univ, Dept Psychol, Graz, Austria; [Steyrl, David; Koschutnig, Karl; Mueller-Putz, Gernot R.] BioTechMed Graz, Graz, Austria	Graz University of Technology; University of Graz	Müller-Putz, GR (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Neural Engn, Lab Brain Comp Interfaces, Graz, Austria.; Müller-Putz, GR (corresponding author), BioTechMed Graz, Graz, Austria.

J	Uludag, K; Blinder, P				Uludag, Kamil; Blinder, Pablo			Linking brain vascular physiology to hemodynamic response in ultra-high field MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Ultra-high magnetic field; BOLD signal; Vasculature; Cerebral blood volume	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BOLD POSTSTIMULUS UNDERSHOOT; HIGH-RESOLUTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SPIN-ECHO; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; LAMINAR SPECIFICITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; INITIAL DIP	Functional MRI using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast indirectly probes neuronal activity via evoked cerebral blood volume (CBV) and oxygenation changes. Thus, its spatio-temporal characteristics are determined by vascular physiology and MRI parameters. In this paper, we focus on the spatial distribution and time course of the fMRI signal and their magnetic field strength dependence. Even though much is still unknown, the following consistent picture is emerging: a) For high spatial resolution imaging, fMRI contrast-to-noise increases supra-linearly with field strength. b) The location and spacing of penetrating arteries and ascending veins in the cortical tissue are not correlated to cortical columns, imposing limitations on achievable point-spread function (PSF) in fMRI. c) Baseline CBV distribution may vary over cortical layers biasing fMRI signal to layers with high CBV values. d) The largest CBV change is in the tissue microvasculature, less in surface arteries and even less in pial veins. e) Venous CBV changes are only relevant for longer stimuli, and oxygenation changes are largest in post-capillary blood vessels. f) The balloon effect (i.e. slow recovery of CBV to baseline) is located in the tissue, consistent with the fact that the post-stimulus undershoot has narrower spatial PSF than the positive BOLD response. g) The onset time following stimulation has been found to be shortest in middle/lower layers, both in optical imaging and high-resolution fMRI, but we argue and demonstrate with simulations that varying signal latencies can also be caused by vascular properties and, therefore, may potentially not be interpreted as neural latencies. With simulations, we illustrate the field strength dependency of fMRI signal transients, such as the adaptation during stimulation, initial dip and the post-stimulus undershoot. In sum, vascular structure and function impose limitations on the achievable PSF of fMRI and give rise to complex fMRI transients, which contain time-varying amount of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal information. Nevertheless, non-invasive fMRI at ultra-high magnetic fields not only provides high contrast-to-noise but also an unprecedented detailed view on cognitive processes in the human brain.

Although 7T scanners offer increased SNR, coverage of commercial head coils is currently limited to the cerebrum. PurposeTo improve cerebellar functional MRI (fMRI) at 7T with high permittivity material (HPM) pads extending the sensitivity of a commercial coil. Study TypeSimulations were used to determine HPM pad configuration and assess radiofrequency (RF) safety. In vivo experiments were performed to evaluate RF field distributions and SNR and assess improvements of cerebellar fMRI. SubjectsEight healthy volunteers enrolled in a prospective motor fMRI study with and without HPM. Field Strength/SequenceGradient echo (GRE) echo planar imaging for fMRI, turbo FLASH for flip angle mapping, GRE sequence for SNR maps, and T-1-weighted MPRAGE were acquired with and without HPM pads at 7T. AssessmentField maps, SNR maps, and anatomical images were evaluated for coverage. Simulation results were used to assess SAR levels of the experiment. Activation data from fMRI experiments were compared with and without HPM pads. Statistical TestsfMRI data were analyzed using FEAT FSL for each subject followed by group level analysis using paired t-test of acquisitions with and without HPM. ResultsSimulations showed 52% improvement in transmit efficiency in cerebellum with HPM and SAR levels well below recommended limits. Experiments showed 27% improvement in SNR in cerebellum and improvement in coverage on T-1-weighted images. fMRI showed greater cerebellar activation in individual subjects with the HPM pad present (Z>=4), especially in inferior slices of cerebellum, with 59% average increase in number of activated voxels in the cerebellum. Group-level analysis showed improved functional activation (Z>=2.3) in cerebellar regions with HPM pads without loss of measured activation elsewhere. Data ConclusionHPM pads can improve cerebellar fMRI at 7T with a commonly-used head coil without compromising RF safety. Level of Evidence: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J. MAGN. RESON.

Since the introduction of MRI in the clinical practice, several advanced applications have been developed, like functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion imaging-based tractography (DTI), which both have an application in glioma surgery. fMRI allows to identify cortical areas related to a specific function, DTI allows to reconstruct a model of the sub-cortical connectivity. This paper describes the clinical application of fMRI and DTI, enlightening sensitivity and specificity in comparison to gold standard and underlining their limitations in surgical decision making.

Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively normalized these functional alterations. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Six patients with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic artifacts. fMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both attention and default mode networks. EEG connectivity among regions of the motor network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain. This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, dorsal attention and default mode networks.

Integrated SSFP for functional brain mapping at 7 T with reduced susceptibility artifact	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE			English	Article						Integrated SSFP (iSSFP); fMRI; Ultrahigh magnetic field; Susceptibility artifact; Semantic	STATE FREE PRECESSION; ANTERIOR TEMPORAL-LOBE; NOISE CHARACTERISTICS; GRADIENT-ECHO; SIGNAL; FMRI; OXYGENATION; TRUEFISP; HUMANS; POWER	Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) offers an alternative and potentially important tool to the standard gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) for functional MRI (fMRI). Both passband and transition band based bSSFP have been proposed for fMRI. The applications of these methods, however, are limited by banding artifacts due to the sensitivity of bSSFP signal to off-resonance effects. In this article, a unique case of the SSFP-FID sequence, termed integrated-SSFP or iSSFP, was proposed to overcome the obstacle by compressing the SSFP profile into the width of a single voxel. The magnitude of the iSSFP signal was kept constant irrespective of frequency shift. Visual stimulation studies were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of fMRI using iSSFP at 7 T with flip angles of 4 degrees and 25 degrees, compared to standard bSSFP and gradient echo (GRE) imaging. The signal changes for the complex iSSFP signal in activated voxels were 2.48 +/- 0.53 (%) and 2.96 +/- 0.87 (%) for flip angles (FA) of 4 degrees and 25 degrees respectively at the TR of 9.88 ms. Simultaneous multi-slice acquisition (SMS) with the CAIPIRIHNA technique was carried out with iSSFP scanning to detect the anterior temporal lobe activation using a semantic processing task fMRI, compared with standard 2D GE-EPI. This study demonstrates the feasibility of iSSFP for fMRI with reduced susceptibility artifacts, while maintaining robust functional contrast at 7 T. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Elucidating relations between fMRI, ECoG, and EEG through a common natural stimulus	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; ECoG; EEG; Repeat-reliability; Inter-method correlation	FIELD POTENTIAL POWER; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; RESTING-STATE; NEUROIMAGING DATA; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS	Human brain mapping relies heavily on fMRI, ECoG and EEG, which capture different physiological signals. Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state, often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here, we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First, how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (N-EEG = 45, N-fMRI = 11, N-ECoG = 5) and assessed stimulus-driven correlations across viewings and between imaging methods, thereby ruling out task-irrelevant confounds. All three imaging methods had similar repeat-reliability across viewings when fMRI and EEG data were averaged across subjects, highlighting the potential to achieve large signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging large sample sizes. The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG power across multiple task-related cortical structures but positively with low-frequency EEG and ECoG power. In contrast to previous studies, these correlations were as strong for low-frequency as for high frequency ECoG. We also observed links between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations. These results extend previous findings to the case of natural stimulus processing.

Recent studies suggest that these contributions are highly variable across subjects and that physiological noise correction may thus benefit from optimization at the subject or even voxel level. Here, we systematically investigated the impact of the degree of spatial specificity (group, subject, newly proposed cluster, and voxel levels) on the optimization of RV and HR models. For each degree of spatial specificity, we measured the fMRI signal variance explained (VE) by each model, as well as the functional connectivity underlying three well-known resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained from the fMRI data after removal of RV+HR contributions. Whole-brain, high-resolution rs-fMRI data were acquired from twelve healthy volunteers at 7 T, while simultaneously recording their cardiac and respiratory signals. Although VE increased with spatial specificity up to the voxel level, the accuracy of functional connectivity measurements improved only up to the cluster level, and subsequently decreased at the voxel level. This suggests that voxelwise modeling over-fits to local fluctuations with no physiological meaning. In conclusion, our results indicate that 7 T rs-fMRI connectivity measurements improve if a cluster-based physiological noise correction approach is employed in order to take into account the individual spatial variability in the HR and RV contributions.

J	Zhuang, XW; Yang, ZS; Curran, T; Byrd, R; Nandy, R; Cordes, D				Zhuang, Xiaowei; Yang, Zhengshi; Curran, Tim; Byrd, Richard; Nandy, Rajesh; Cordes, Dietmar			A family of locally constrained CCA models for detecting activation patterns in fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Constrained canonical correlation analysis (cCCA); Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); Multivariate analysis; Numerical optimization; Episodic memory task	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; MRI; HIPPOCAMPUS; MEMORY	Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been used in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for improved detection of activation by incorporating time series from multiple voxels in a local neighborhood. To improve the specificity of local CCA methods, spatial constraints were previously proposed. In this study, constraints are generalized by introducing a family model of spatial constraints for CCA to further increase both sensitivity and specificity in fMRI activation detection. The proposed locally-constrained CCA (cCCA) model is formulated in terms of a multivariate constrained optimization problem and solved efficiently with numerical optimization techniques. To evaluate the performance of this cCCA model, simulated data are generated with a Signal-To-Noise Ratio of 0.25, which is realistic to the noise level contained in episodic memory fMRI data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods are used to compare the performance of different models. The cCCA model with optimum parameters (called optimum-cCCA) obtains the largest area under the ROC curve. Furthermore, a novel validation method is proposed to validate the selected optimum-cCCA parameters based on ROC from simulated data and real fMRI data. Results for optimum-cCCA are then compared with conventional DART analysis methods using data from an episodic memory task. Wavelet-resampled resting-state data are used to obtain the null distribution of activation. For simulated data, accuracy in detecting activation increases for the optimum-cCCA model by about 43% as compared to the single voxel analysis with comparable Gaussian smoothing. Results from the real fMRI data set indicate a significant increase in activation detection, particularly in hippocampus, para-hippocampal area and nearby medial temporal lobe regions with the proposed method.

This review introduces functional MRI (fMRI) as an outstanding tool to assess rapid effects of sex steroids on auditory processing in seasonal songbirds. We emphasize specific advantages of this method as compared to other more conventional and invasive methods used for this purpose and summarize an exemplary auditory fMRI study performed on male starlings exposed to different types of starling song before and immediately after the inhibition of aromatase activity by an i.p. injection of Vorozolem. We describe how most challenges that relate to the necessity to anesthetize subjects and minimize image-and sound-artifacts can be overcome in order to obtain a voxel-based 3D-representation of changes in auditory brain activity to various sound stimuli before and immediately after a pharmacologically-induced depletion of endogenous estrogens. Analysis of the fMRI data by assumption-free statistical methods identified fast specific changes in activity in the auditory brain regions that were stimulus-specific, varying over different seasons, and in several instances lateralized to the left side of the brain. This set of results illustrates the unique features of fMRI that provides opportunities to localize and quantify the brain responses to rapid changes in hormonal status. fMRI offers a new image-guided research strategy in which the spatio-temporal profile of fast neuromodulations can be identified and linked to specific behavioral inputs or outputs. This approach can also be combined with more localized invasive methods to investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed neural changes.

Here, we present improved methodology for MRI-compatible implants without the use of acrylic for head stabilization in NHPs. New method: MRI is used to obtain a 3D-reconstruction of NHP skulls, which are used to create customized implants by modeling intersections with the bone. Implants are manufactured from PEEK using computer numerical control machining and coated with hydroxyapatite to promote osseointegration. Surgically, implants are attached to the skull with ceramic screws, while the skin flap is pulled over the implant and closed subcutaneously. Results: Quality of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal is improved in animals implanted with our method as compared to traditional acrylic implants. Additionally, implants are well-integrated with the skull, remain robust for more than a year and without granulation tissue around the skin margin. Comparison with existing method(s): Previous improvements on NHP implants (Chen et al., 2017; McAndrew et al., 2012; Mulliken et al., 2015; Overton et al., 2017) lacked fMRI-compatibility, as they relied on titanium headposts and/or titanium screws. Thus, most fMRI studies in NHPs today still rely on the use of acrylic-based headposts for stabilization and the use of contrast-enhanced agents to improve MRI signal. Conclusions: Our method preserves fMRI-compatibility and results in measurable improvement in BOLD signal without the use of contrast-enhanced agents. Furthermore, the long-term stability of our implants contributes positively to the wellbeing of NHPs in neuroscience research.

Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of multicenter rs-fMRI for prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. Methods: We determined rs-fMRI functional connectivity based on Pearson's correlation coefficients and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in people with subjective cognitive decline, people with mild cognitive impairment, and people with AD dementia compared with healthy controls. We used data of 247 participants of the prospective DELCODE study, a longitudinal multicenter observational study, imposing a unified fMRI acquisition protocol across sites. We determined cross-validated discrimination accuracy based on penalized logistic regression to account for multicollinearity of predictors. Results: Resting state functional connectivity reached significant cross-validated group discrimination only for the comparison of AD dementia cases with healthy controls, but not for the other diagnostic groups. AD dementia cases showed alterations in a large range of intrinsic resting state networks, including the default mode and salience networks, but also executive and language networks. When groups were stratified according to their CSF amyloid status that was available in a subset of cases, diagnostic accuracy was increased for amyloid positive mild cognitive impairment cases compared with amyloid negative controls, but still inferior to the accuracy of hippocampus volume. Conclusion: Even when following a strictly harmonized data acquisition protocol and rigorous scan quality control, widely used connectivity measures of multicenter rs-fMRI do not reach levels of diagnostic accuracy sufficient for a useful biomarker in prodromal stages of AD.

So far, the cortical processing of pitch has been investigated mostly using synthetic sounds. However, the complex harmonic structure of natural sounds may require different mechanisms for the extraction and analysis of pitch. This study investigated the neural representation of pitch in human auditory cortex using model-based encoding and decoding analyses of high field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected while participants listened to a wide range of real-life sounds. Specifically, we modeled the fMRI responses as a function of the sounds' perceived pitch height and salience (related to the fundamental frequency and the harmonic structure respectively), which we estimated with a computational algorithm of pitch extraction (de Cheveigne and Kawahara, 2002). First, using single-voxel fMRI encoding, we identified a pitch-coding region in the antero-lateral Heschl's gyrus (HG) and adjacent superior temporal gyrus (STG). In these regions, the pitch representation model combining height and salience predicted the fMRI responses comparatively better than other models of acoustic processing and, in the right hemisphere, better than pitch representations based on height/salience alone. Second, we assessed with model-based decoding that multi-voxel response patterns of the identified regions are more informative of perceived pitch than the remainder of the auditory cortex. Further multivariate analyses showed that complementing a multi-resolution spectro-temporal sound representation with pitch produces a small but significant improvement to the decoding of complex sounds from fMRI response patterns. In sum, this work extends model-based fMRI encoding and decoding methods - previously employed to examine the representation and processing of acoustic sound features in the human auditory system - to the representation and processing of a relevant perceptual attribute such as pitch. Taken together, the results of our model-based encoding and decoding analyses indicated that the pitch of complex real life sounds is extracted and processed in lateral HG/STG regions, at locations consistent with those indicated in several previous fMRI studies using synthetic sounds. Within these regions, pitch-related sound representations reflect the modulatory combination of height and the salience of the pitch percept.

Mild Jugular Compression Collar Ameliorated Changes in Brain Activation of Working Memory after One Soccer Season in Female High School Athletes	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						female soccer athletes; fMRI; head impact; N-Back task; neck collar; working memory	HEAD IMPACT EXPOSURE; SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; AXONAL INJURY; FMRI; SYMPTOMS; RECOVERY; FOOTBALL; TIME; MICROSTRUCTURE	Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that repetitive subconcussive head impacts, even after only one sport season, may lead to pre- to post-season structural and functional alterations in male high school football athletes. However, data on female athletes are limited. In the current investigation, we aimed to (1) assess the longitudinal pre- to post-season changes in functional MRI (fMRI) of working memory and working memory performance, (2) quantify the association between the pre- to post-season change in fMRI of working memory and the exposure to head impact and working memory performance, and (3) assess whether wearing a neck collar designed to reduce intracranial slosh via mild compression of the jugular veins can ameliorate the changes in fMRI brain activation observed in the female high school athletes who did not wear collars after a full soccer season. A total of 48 female high school soccer athletes (age range: 14.00-17.97 years) were included in the study. These athletes were assigned to the non-collar group (n = 21) or to the collar group (n = 27). All athletes undewent MRI at both pre-season and post-season. In each session, a fMRI verbal N-Back task was used to engage working memory. A significant pre- to post-season increase in fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal was demonstrated when performing the N-back working memory task in the non-collar group but not in the collar group, despite the comparable exposure to head impacts during the season between the two groups. The collar group demonstrated significantly smaller pre- to post-season change in fMRI BOLD signal than the non-collar group, suggesting a potential protective effect from the collar device. Significant correlations were also found between the pre- to post-season increase in fMRI brain activation and the decrease in task accuracy in the non-collar group, indicating an association between the compensatory mechanism in underlying neurophysiology and the alteration in the behavioral outcomes.

However, data analysis methods for fNIRS are still underdeveloped compared to those available for fMRI. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) is an advanced connectivity technique developed for fMRI data, that aims to estimate the coupling between brain regions and how this might be modulated by changes in experimental conditions. DCM has recently been applied to adult fNIRS, but not to infants. The present paper provides a proof-of-principle for the application of this method to infant fNIRS data and a demonstration of the robustness of this method using a simultaneously recorded fMRI-fNIRS single case study, thereby allowing the use of this technique in future infant studies. fMRI and fNIRS were simultaneously recorded from a 6-month-old sleeping infant, who was presented with auditory stimuli in a block design. Both fMRI and fNIRS data were preprocessed using SPM, and analysed using a general linear model approach. The main challenges that adapting DCM for fNIRS infant data posed included: (i) the import of the structural image of the participant for spatial pre-processing, (ii) the spatial registration of the optodes on the structural image of the infant, (iii) calculation of an accurate 3-layer segmentation of the structural image, (iv) creation of a high-density mesh as well as (v) the estimation of the NIRS optical sensitivity functions. To assess our results, we compared the values obtained for variational Free Energy (F), Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) and Bayesian Model Average (BMA) with the same set of possible models applied to both the fMRI and fNIRS datasets. We found high correspondence in F, BMS, and BMA between fMRI and fNIRS data, therefore showing for the first time high reliability of DCM applied to infant fNIRS data. This work opens new avenues for future research on effective connectivity in infancy by contributing a data analysis pipeline and guidance for applying DCM to infant fNIRS data.

However, the effects of bilingualism on language activation depend on many factors including age of acquisition and proficiency in the tested language, and morphological properties of the language itself. This case demonstrates that completing fMRI in both spoken languages and interpreting the results within the context of a neuropsychological assessment are essential in arriving at accurate conclusions about language distribution in bilingual patients.

Ultrahigh magnetic field strengths (7 T and above) allow functional imaging with even higher functional contrast-to-noise ratios for improved spatial resolution and specificity compared to traditional field strengths (1.5 T and 3 T). High-resolution 7 T fMRI, however, has primarily been constrained to smaller brain regions given the amount of time it takes to acquire the number of slices necessary for high resolution whole brain imaging. Here we evaluate a range of whole-brain high-resolution resting state fMRI protocols (0.9, 1.25, 1.5, 1.6 and 2 mm isotropic voxels) at 7 T, obtained with both in-plane and slice acceleration parallel imaging techniques to maintain the temporal resolution and brain coverage typically acquired at 3 T. Using the processing pipeline developed by the Human Connectome Project, we demonstrate that high resolution images acquired at 7 T provide increased functional contrast to noise ratios with significantly less partial volume effects and more distinct spatial features, potentially allowing for robust individual subject parcellations and descriptions of fine-scaled patterns, such as visuotopic organization.

Anatomic Location of Tumor Predicts the Accuracy of Motor Function Localization in Diffuse Lower-Grade Gliomas Involving the Hand Knob Area	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; IMAGE-GUIDED NEUROSURGERY; BOLD-FMRI; BRAIN-TUMORS; RESTING-STATE; INTRAOPERATIVE STIMULATION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; BLOOD OXYGENATION; CENTRAL SULCUS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The accuracy of preoperative blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI remains controversial. This study assessed the association between the anatomic location of a tumor and the accuracy of fMRI-based motor function mapping in diffuse lower-grade gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with lower-grade gliomas involving motor areas underwent preoperative blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI scans with grasping tasks and received intraoperative direct cortical stimulation. Patients were classified into an overlapping group and a nonoverlapping group, depending on the extent to which blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI and direct cortical stimulation results concurred. Tumor location was quantitatively measured, including the shortest distance from the tumor to the hand knob and the deviation distance of the midpoint of the hand knob in the lesion hemisphere relative to the midline compared with the normal contralateral hemisphere. RESULTS: A 4-mm shortest distance from the tumor to the hand knob value was identified as optimal for differentiating the overlapping and nonoverlapping group with the receiver operating characteristic curve (sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 77.8%). The shortest distances from the tumor to the hand knob of 4 mm were associated with inaccurate fMRI-based localizations of the hand motor cortex. The shortest distances from the tumor to the hand knob were larger (P = .002), and the deviation distances for the midpoint of the hand knob in the lesion hemisphere were smaller (P = .003) in the overlapping group than in the nonoverlapping group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the shortest distance from the tumor to the hand knob and the deviation distance for the midpoint of the hand knob on the lesion hemisphere are predictive of the accuracy of blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI results. Smaller shortest distances from the tumor to the hand knob and larger deviation distances for the midpoint of hand knob on the lesion hemisphere are associated with less accuracy of motor cortex localization with blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI. Preoperative fMRI data for surgical planning should be used cautiously when the shortest distance from the tumor to the hand knob is 4 mm, especially for lower-grade gliomas anterior to the central sulcus.

Andrew; Diedrichsen, Jorn			Stability of representational geometry across a wide range of fMRI activity levels	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi-voxel pattern analysis; fMRI; Representational similarity analysis; Representational geometry	SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; RESPONSES; BOLD	Fine-grained activity patterns, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are thought to reflect underlying neural representations. Multivariate analysis techniques, such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), can be used to test models of brain representation by quantifying the representational geometry (the collection of pair-wise dissimilarities between activity patterns). One important caveat, however, is that non-linearities in the coupling between neural activity and the fMRI signal may lead to significant distortions in the representational geometry estimated from fMRI activity patterns. Here we tested the stability of representational dissimilarity measures in primary sensory-motor (S1 and M1) and early visual regions (V1/V2) across a large range of activation levels. Participants were visually cued with different letters to perform single finger presses with one of the 5 fingers at a rate of 0.3-2.6 Hz. For each stimulation frequency, we quantified the difference between the 5 activity patterns in M1, S1, and V1/V2. We found that the representational geometry remained relatively stable, even though the average activity increased over a large dynamic range. These results indicate that the representational geometry of fMRI activity patterns can be reliably assessed, largely independent of the average activity in the region. This has important methodological implications for RSA and other multivariate analysis approaches that use the representational geometry to make inferences about brain representations.

Functional brain lateralization in schizophrenia based on the variability of resting-state fMRI signal	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Lateralization; Brain signal variability; Resting-state fMRI	LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PLANUM TEMPORALE; HEMISPHERIC LATERALIZATION; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; BOLD VARIABILITY; MOTOR CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; COMPLEXITY	Abnormal brain lateralization has been implicated in schizophrenia but few studies have focused on the variability of resting-state fMRI signal and its lateralization in schizophrenia. Here we utilized standard deviations (SD) to quantify the variability of resting-state fMRI signal and measured the lateralization index (LI), on the basis of SD of the resting-state fMRI signal in order to assess the difference of brain signal variability across the hemispheres. We recruited 180 patients with schizophrenia and 358 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Between group comparison revealed that in comparison to healthy volunteers, schizophrenia patients have significantly higher SD of resting state fMRI activity in left inferior temporal, left fusiform, and right superior medial frontal cortex, and lower SD in right precuneus, posterior cingulum on both sides, right lingual, and left calcarine in the occipital region. Using region of interest approach, most brain regions showed increased leftward lateralization in patients with schizophrenia, as compared with healthy controls. SD and LI were also found to be correlated to age of onset or duration of illness. These results provide further evidence that abnormal variability and lateralization exist in schizophrenia patients, and abnormality in fusiform, lingual and inferior temporal could have potential help to identify the dysfunctional brain lateralization in schizophrenia.

Long-range projections coordinate distributed brain-wide neural activity with a specific spatiotemporal profile	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						fMRI; optogenetic; brain connectivity; low frequency; thalamus	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SYNAPTIC PROPERTIES; THALAMIC INPUT; FMRI; CIRCUITS; NEURONS; CORTICES; NUCLEUS; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS	One challenge in contemporary neuroscience is to achieve an integrated understanding of the large-scale brain-wide interactions, particularly the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that give rise to functions and behavior. At present, little is known about the spatiotemporal properties of long-range neuronal networks. We examined brain-wide neural activity patterns elicited by stimulating ventral posteromedial (VPM) thalamo-cortical excitatory neurons through combined optogenetic stimulation and functional MRI (fMRI). We detected robust optogenetically evoked fMRI activation bilaterally in primary visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortices at low (1 Hz) but not high frequencies (5-40 Hz). Subsequent electrophysiological recordings indicated interactions over long temporal windows across thalamo-cortical, cortico-cortical, and interhemispheric callosal projections at low frequencies. We further observed enhanced visually evoked fMRI activation during and after VPM stimulation in the superior colliculus, indicating that visual processing was subcortically modulated by low-frequency activity originating from VPM. Stimulating posteromedial complex thalamo- cortical excitatory neurons also evoked brain-wide bloodoxygenation- level-dependent activation, although with a distinct spatiotemporal profile. Our results directly demonstrate that lowfrequency activity governs large-scale, brain-wide connectivity and interactions through long-range excitatory projections to coordinate the functional integration of remote brain regions. This low-frequency phenomenon contributes to the neural basis of long-range functional connectivity as measured by resting-state fMRI.	[Leong, Alex T.

However, a major problem in interpreting this data arises from a fact that several unrelated processes, such as memory load, sensory adaptation, and reward expectation, also change in a consistent manner as the sequence unfolds. In this paper we use computational simulations and data from two fMRI experiments to show that a host of unrelated neural processes can masquerade as sequence representations. We show that dissociating such unrelated processes from a dedicated sequence representation is an especially difficult problem for fMRI data, which is almost exclusively the modality used in human experiments. We suggest that such fMRI results must be treated with caution and in many cases the assumed neural representation might actually reflect unrelated processes.

These artifacts depend on head position, and are, therefore, difficult to remove in the presence of subject motion. In this study, gradient artifacts are modeled by multiple templates extracted from externally recorded motion information. Methods: Gradient artifact correction was performed in EEG-fMRI recordings by estimating artifactual templates modulated by slowly varying splines, as well as head position information. The EEG signal quality was then compared following two common methods: averaged artifact subtraction (AAS) and optimal basis sets (OBS). Results: Artifact correction using multiple templates estimated from splines or motion time courses outperformed the existing AAS and OBS approaches, as quantified by root-meansquare power across gradient epochs. Improvements were mostly seen in posterior EEG channels, where most of the residual artifacts are seen following the AAS and OBS methods. Residual spectral power was comparable to that of EEG signals recorded without fMRI scanning. Conclusion: Gradient artifacts can be well modeled by multiple templates estimated from head position information, resulting in an effective artifact removal. Significance: This method can facilitate EEG-fMRI of uncooperative subjects in whom motion is inevitable, for example, to investigate high-frequency EEG activity in which gradient artifacts are particularly prominent.

Linear correlations in spontaneous blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) fluctuations are often used as measures of functional connectivity (FC), that is, as a quantity describing how similarly two brain regions behave over time. Given the natural spectral scaling of BOLD-fMRI signals, it may be useful to represent BOLD-fMRI as multiple processes occurring over multiple scales. The wavelet domain presents a transform space well suited to the examination of multiscale systems as the wavelet basis set is constructed from a self-similar rescaling of a time and frequency delimited kernel. In the present study, we utilize wavelet transforms to examine fluctuations in whole-brain BOLD-fMRI connectivity as a function of wavelet spectral scale in a sample (N = 31) of resting healthy human volunteers. Information theoretic criteria measure relatedness between spectrally-delimited FC graphs. Voxelwise comparisons of between-spectra graph structures illustrate the development of preferential functional networks across spectral bands.	[Billings, Jacob C.

In particular, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) enables monitoring of functional adaptations across the brain, for example, in response to chronic nociceptive input. We have used rs-fMRI in a mouse model of chronic pain from breast cancer-derived tibial bone metastases to identify pain-induced alterations in functional connectivity. Combined assessment of behavioral readouts allowed for defining a trajectory as model function for extracting pain-specific functional connectivity changes from the fMRI data reflective of a chronic pain state. Cingulate and prefrontal cortices as well as the ventral striatum were identified as predominantly affected regions, in line with findings from clinical and preclinical studies. Inhibition of the peripheral bone remodeling processes by antiosteolytic therapy led to a reduction of pain-induced network alterations, emphasizing the specificity of the functional readouts for a developing chronic pain state.

The neural mechanisms of prism adaptation have come under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations of prism adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, but not so much that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components of prism adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features of prism adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated. We propose recommendations for fMRI studies of prism adaptation based on the design-specific constraints and our results.

The use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and machine learning may represent valid aids in clinical settings for the identification of MCI patients. Methods: Machine-learning models were computed to test the classificatory accuracy of cognitive, volumetric [structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)] and blood oxygen level dependentconnectivity (extracted from RS-fMRI) features, in single-modality and mixed classifiers. Results: The best and most significant classifier was the RS-fMRI + Cognitive mixed classifier (94% accuracy), whereas the worst performing was the sMRI classifier (similar to 80%). The mixed global (sMRI+RS-fMRI+Cognitive) had a slightly lower accuracy (similar to 90%), although not statistically different from the mixed RSfMRI+Cognitive classifier. The most important cognitive features were indices of declarative memory and semantic processing. The crucial volumetric feature was the hippocampus. The RS-fMRI features selected by the algorithms were heavily based on the connectivity of mediotemporal, left temporal, and other neocortical regions. Conclusion: Feature selection was profoundly driven by statistical independence. Some features showed no between-group differences, or showed a trend in either direction. This indicates that clinically relevant brain alterations typical of MCI might be subtle and not inferable from group analysis.

Previous rs-fMRI studies have mainly focused on adults and elderly subjects. Recently, infant rs-fMRI studies have become an area of active research. After a decade of gap filling studies, many facets of the brain functional development from early infancy to toddler has been uncovered. However, infant rs-fMRI is still in its infancy. The image analysis tools for neonates and young infants can be quite different from those for adults. From data analysis to result interpretation, more questions and issues have been raised, and new hypotheses have been formed. With the anticipated availability of unprecedented high-resolution rs-fMRI and dedicated analysis pipelines from the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), it is important now to revisit previous findings and hypotheses, discuss and comment existing issues and problems, and make a "to-do-list" for the future studies. This review article aims to comprehensively review a decade of the findings, unveiling hidden jewels of the fields of developmental neuroscience and neuroimage computing. Emphases will be given to early infancy, particularly the first few years of life. In this review, an end-to-end summary, from infant rs-fMRI experimental design to data processing, and from the development of individual functional systems to large-scale brain functional networks, is provided. A comprehensive summary of the rs-fMRI findings in developmental patterns is highlighted. Furthermore, an extensive summary of the neurodevelopmental disorders and the effects of other hazardous factors is provided. Finally, future research trends focusing on emerging dynamic functional connectivity and state-of-the-art functional connectome analysis are summarized. In next decade, early infant rs-fMRI and developmental connectome study could be one of the shining research topics.

Nonetheless, these findings are heterogeneous and have not been quantitatively reviewed. Thus, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis that identified consistent results of existing resting-state fMRI studies to determine concordant resting-state neural brain activity alterations in T2DM patients. A systematic search was conducted for resting-state fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. Coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences. The meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method, and nine studies were included. This meta-analysis identified robustly reduced resting-state brain activity in the whole brain of T2DM patients, including the bilateral lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellar culmen, right insula and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The present study demonstrates a characteristic pattern of resting-state brain anomalies that will contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM.

J	Kashyap, A; Keilholz, S				Kashyap, Amrit; Keilholz, Sheila			Dynamic properties of simulated brain network models and empirical resting-state data	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Resting-state fMRI; Brain network modeling; Dynamics; Dynamic functional connectivity	QUASI-PERIODIC PATTERNS; LARGE-SCALE BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; FMRI; FLUCTUATIONS; REGIONS; PROMISE; TIME	Brain network models (BNMs) have become a promising theoretical framework for simulating signals that are representative of whole-brain activity such as resting-state fMRI. However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity obtained from simulations to empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics to characterize coordination between regions such as functional connectivity. We extend this by applying various different dynamic analysis tools that are currently used to understand empirical resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to the simulated data. We show that certain properties correspond to the structural connectivity input that is shared between the models, and certain dynamic properties relate more to the mathematical description of the brain network model. We conclude that the dynamic properties that explicitly examine patterns of signal as a function of time rather than spatial coordination between different brain regions in the rs-fMRI signal seem to provide the largest contrasts between different BNMs and the unknown empirical dynamical system. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity. Author SummaryThe development of more sophisticated models of the brain will allow us to address some of the most challenging questions in neuroscience, such as how the physical structure of the brain can give rise to behavior, consciousness, and memory. Our focus in this manuscript is on simulating the relatively slow brain signals that coordinate information transfer across large scales in the brain and that can be measured using fMRI. Previous measures used averaged measures of functional connectivity in the simulated brain signals to compare with the empirical signal. In order to extend previous findings, we use dynamic analysis techniques developed for these fMRI signals to understand more transient events that occur naturally during normal brain activity. We show that these dynamic properties are better in differentiating models from each other and from the measured brain activity. These results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity.

Stimulus-dependent hemodynamic response timing across the human subcortical-cortical visual pathway identified through high spatiotemporal resolution 7T fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; BOLD RESPONSE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BLOOD-FLOW; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; ACTIVATION; INSIGHTS; SIGNAL	Recent developments in fMRI acquisition techniques now enable fast sampling with whole-brain coverage, suggesting fMRI can be used to track changes in neural activity at increasingly rapid timescales. When images are acquired at fast rates, the limiting factor for fMRI temporal resolution is the speed of the hemodynamic response. Given that HRFs may vary substantially in subcortical structures, characterizing the speed of subcortical hemodynamic responses, and how the hemodynamic response shape changes with stimulus duration (i.e. the hemodynamic nonlinearity), is needed for designing and interpreting fast fMRI studies of these regions. We studied the temporal properties and nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) across the human subcortical visual system, imaging superior colliculus (SC), lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) with high spatiotemporal resolution 7 Tesla fMRI. By presenting stimuli of varying durations, we mapped the timing and nonlinearity of hemodynamic responses in these structures at high spatiotemporal resolution. We found that the hemodynamic response is consistently faster and narrower in subcortical structures than in cortex. However, the nonlinearity in LGN is similar to that in cortex, with shorter duration stimuli eliciting larger and faster responses than would have been predicted by a linear model. Using oscillatory visual stimuli, we tested the frequency response in LGN and found that its BOLD response tracked high-frequency (0.5 Hz) oscillations. The LGN response magnitudes were comparable to V1, allowing oscillatory BOLD signals to be detected in LGN despite the small size of this structure. These results suggest that the increase in the speed and amplitude of the hemodynamic response when neural activity is brief may be the key physiological driver of fast fMRI signals, enabling detection of high-frequency oscillations with fMRI. We conclude that subcortical visual structures exhibit fast and nonlinear hemodynamic responses, and that these dynamics enable detection of fast BOLD signals even within small deep brain structures when imaging is performed at ultra-high field.

Improved state change estimation in dynamic functional connectivity using hidden semi-Markov models	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dynamic functional connectivity; Hidden Markov models; Hidden semi-Markov models; fMRI; Brain networks; Sojourn distribution	FMRI DATA; REGRESSION	The study of functional brain networks has grown rapidly over the past decade. While most functional connectivity (FC) analyses estimate one static network structure for the entire length of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, recently there has been increased interest in studying time-varying changes in FC. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be a useful modeling approach for discovering repeating graphs of interacting brain regions (brain states). However, a limitation lies in HMMs assuming that the sojourn time, the number of consecutive time points in a state, is geometrically distributed. This may encourage inaccurate estimation of the time spent in a state before switching to another state. We propose a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) approach for inferring time-varying brain networks from fMRI data, which explicitly models the sojourn distribution. Specifically, we propose using HSMMs to find each subject's most probable series of network states and the graphs associated with each state, while properly estimating and modeling the sojourn distribution for each state. We perform a simulation study, as well as an analysis on both task-based fMRI data from an anxiety-inducing experiment and resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results demonstrate the importance of model choice when estimating sojourn times and reveal their potential for understanding healthy and diseased brain mechanisms.

Assessing Variations in Areal Organization for the Intrinsic Brain: From Fingerprints to Reliability	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						areal organization; individual differences; reliability; resting-state fMRI; transition zones	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY ARCHITECTURE; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; DISCOVERY SCIENCE; GENETIC-CONTROL; FMRI DATA; NETWORKS; RESOLUTION; PARCELLATIONS	Resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) is a powerful in-vivo tool for examining the functional architecture of the human brain. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability to characterize transitions between functionally distinct cortical areas through the mapping of gradients in intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) profiles. To date, this novel approach has primarily been applied to iFC profiles averaged across groups of individuals, or in one case, a single individual scanned multiple times. Here, we used a publically available R-fMRI dataset, in which 30 healthy participants were scanned 10 times (10 min per session), to investigate differences in full-brain transition profiles (i.e., gradient maps, edge maps) across individuals, and their reliability. 10-min R-fMRI scans were sufficient to achieve high accuracies in efforts to "fingerprint" individuals based upon full-brain transition profiles. Regarding test-retest reliability, the image-wise intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was moderate, and vertex-level ICC varied depending on region; larger durations of data yielded higher reliability scores universally. Initial application of gradient-based methodologies to a recently published dataset obtained from twins suggested inter-individual variation in areal profiles might have genetic and familial origins. Overall, these results illustrate the utility of gradient-based iFC approaches for studying inter-individual variation in brain function.

J	Chai, YH; Sheng, JW; Bandettini, PA; Gao, JH				Chai, Yuhui; Sheng, Jingwei; Bandettini, Peter A.; Gao, Jia-Hong			Frequency-dependent tACS modulation of BOLD signal during rhythmic visual stimulation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						brain oscillation; fMRI; tACS	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CORTEX; FMRI; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; RESONANCE; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has emerged as a promising tool for modulating cortical oscillations. In previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, tACS has been found to modulate brain oscillatory activity in a frequency-specific manner. However, the spatial distribution and hemodynamic response for this modulation remains poorly understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the advantage of measuring neuronal activity in regions not only below the tACS electrodes but also across the whole brain with high spatial resolution. Here, we measured fMRI signal while applying tACS to modulate rhythmic visual activity. During fMRI acquisition, tACS at different frequencies (4, 8, 16, and 32 Hz) was applied along with visual flicker stimulation at 8 and 16 Hz. We analyzed the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal difference between tACS-ON vs tACS-OFF, and different frequency combinations (e.g., 4Hz tACS, 8Hz flicker vs 8Hz tACS, 8Hz flicker). We observed significant tACS modulation effects on BOLD responses when the tACS frequency matched the visual flicker frequency or the second harmonic frequency. The main effects were predominantly seen in regions that were activated by the visual task and targeted by the tACS current distribution. These findings bridge different scientific domains of tACS research and demonstrate that fMRI could localize the tACS effect on stimulus-induced brain rhythms, which could lead to a new approach for understanding the high-level cognitive process shaped by the ongoing oscillatory signal.

Renal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique considered superior to the most common method used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, allows for noninvasive, accurate measurements of renal structures and functions in both animals and humans. It has become increasingly prevalent in research and clinical applications. In recent years, renal fMRI has developed rapidly with progress in MRI hardware and emerging postprocessing algorithms. Function-related imaging markers can be acquired via renal fMRI, encompassing water molecular diffusion, perfusion, and oxygenation. This review focuses on the progression and challenges of the main renal fMRI methods, including dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, blood oxygen level-dependent MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling, fat fraction imaging, and their recent clinical applications.

Peculiarities in Interaction of Independent Components of Resting-State fMRI Signal in Patients with Mild Depressions	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						depression; default mode network; analysis of independent components; resting-state fMRI	BLIND SEPARATION; DEFAULT MODE; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORKS; DISORDER	Some aspects of resting-state fMRI signal can be the key markers of depression. fMRI was recoded over 4 min in evidently healthy persons (N=21) and in patients with mild depression (N=21). The data were separated into the independent spatial components, and the strength of their association with established brain networks was analyzed. The patients with mild depression were characterized with greater correlations between the components representing the ventral and dorsal subdivisions of default mode network (DMN), whereas correlations between the components relating to cerebellum and to the left hemisphere language system were less pronounced. The data revealed a significant role of DMN in the development of affective abnormalities and importance of its functional state as a probable marker of mild depression.	[Mel'nikov, M.

EEG-fMRI simultaneous recording has the advantage of enabling the monitoring of brain activity with both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution in real time. The successful removal of the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact from the EEG signal recorded during an MRI is an important prerequisite for real-time EEG-fMRI joint analysis. We have developed a new framework dedicated to BCG artifact removal in real-time. This framework includes a new real-time R-peak detection method combining a k-Teager energy operator, a thresholding detector, and a correlation detector, as well as a real-time BCG artifact reduction procedure combining average artifact template subtraction and a new multi-channel referenced adaptive noise cancelling method. Our results demonstrate that this new framework is efficient in the real-time removal of the BCG artifact. The multi-channel adaptive noise cancellation (mANC) method performs better than the traditional ANC method in eliminating the BCG residual artifact. In addition, the computational speed of the mANC method fulfills the requirements of real-time EEG-fMRI analysis. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The D2/D3 agonist quinpirole, which induces receptor internalization in vitro, was administered at graded doses in non-human primates while imaging with simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A pronounced temporal divergence between receptor occupancy and fMRI signal was observed: occupancy remained elevated while fMRI responded transiently. Analogous experiments with an antagonist (prochlorperazine) and a lower-affinity agonist (ropinirole) exhibited reduced temporal dissociation between occupancy and function, consistent with a mechanism of desensitization and internalization that depends upon drug efficacy and affinity. We postulated a model that incorporates internalization into a neurovascular-coupling relationship. This model yielded in vivo desensitization/internalization rates (0.2/min for quinpirole) consistent with published in vitro measurements. Overall, these results suggest that simultaneous PET/fMRI enables characterization of dynamic neuroreceptor adaptations in vivo, and may offer a first non-invasive method for assessing receptor desensitization and internalization.

We validate this methodology by comparing voxel-wise fNIRS results to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results from a visual working memory (VWM) task using two approaches. In the first approach, significant voxel-wise correlations were observed between fNIRS and fMRI measures for all experimental conditions across brain regions in the fronto-parieto-temporal cortices. In the second approach, we conducted separate multi-factorial ANOVAs on fNIRS and fMRI measures and then examined the correspondence between main and interaction effects within common regions of interest. Both fMRI and fNIRS showed similar trends in activation within the VWM network when the number of items held in worldng memory increases. These results validate the image-based fNIRS approach.

However, there is little consistency of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results across studies. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this variability across studies might - at least in part - be caused by the different tasks employed. In particular, we assessed directly the influence of task set on brain responses to food stimuli with fMRI using two tasks (colour vs. edibility judgement, between-subjects design). When participants judged colour, the left insula, the left inferior parietal lobule, occipital areas, the left orbitofrontal cortex and other frontal areas expressed enhanced fMRI responses to food relative to non-food pictures. However, when judging edibility, enhanced fMRI responses to food pictures were observed in the superior and middle frontal gyrus and in medial frontal areas including the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This pattern of results indicates that task sets can significantly alter the neural underpinnings of food cue processing. We propose that judging low-level visual stimulus characteristics - such as colour - triggers stimulus-related representations in the visual and even in gustatory cortex (insula), whereas discriminating abstract stimulus categories activates higher order representations in both the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex.

Previous studies using emotional task-state functional magnetic resonance (task-state fMRI) found that altered brain function in prefrontal-limbic regions was the key neuropathological mechanism in adult MDD patients with experience of early-life maltreatment. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published study investigating brain function in MDD patients with CM experience using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). In present study, we aimed to detect altered resting-state brain activity in MDD patients with CM experience, and identify significantly activated brain regions, which may provide new insights into the neural mechanism underlying the relationship between MDD and CM experience. The results showed MDD patients with CM experience were associated with increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and altered function connection (FC) in the prefrontal cortex, when compared to MDD patients without CM. Of note, left frontal middle gyrus (LFEG) was found as a specific brain region which differentiates MDD patients with CM from patients without CM. These results suggest that rs-fMRI is a useful method in studying the correlation between MDD and CM experience and altered function of LFEG in resting-state may explain the correlation between MDD and CM experience.

Most of the memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies evaluate the encoding phase; the retrieval phase being performed outside the MRI. We aimed to determine the ability to reveal greater hippocampal fMRI activations during retrieval phase. Materials and methods. - Thirty-five epileptic patients underwent a two-step memory fMRI. During encoding phase, subjects were requested to identify the feminine or masculine gender of faces and words presented, in order to encourage stimulus encoding. One hour after, during retrieval phase, subjects had to recognize the word and face. We used an event-related design to identify hippocampal activations. Results. - There was no significant difference between patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy, patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy and patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy on verbal and visual learning task. For words, patients demonstrated significantly more bilateral hippocampal activation for retrieval task than encoding task and when the tasks were associated than during encoding alone. Significant difference was seen between face-encoding alone and face retrieval alone. Conclusions. - This study demonstrates the essential contribution of the retrieval task during a fMRI memory task but the number of patients with hippocampal activations was greater when the two tasks were taken into account.

Previous studies have evaluated RSNs mainly based on spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, separation between regional increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen consumption is theoretically difficult using BOLD-fMRI. Such separation can be achieved using quantitative O-15-gas and water positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, F-18-FDG PET can be used to investigate functional connectivity based on changes in glucose metabolism, which reflects local brain activity. Previous studies have highlighted the feasibility and clinical usefulness of F-18-FDG-PET for the analysis of RSNs, and recent studies have utilized simultaneous PET/fMRI for such analyses. While PET provides seed information regarding the focus of the abnormalities (e.g., hypometabolism and reduced target binding), fMRI is used for the analysis of functional connectivity. Thus, as PET and fMRI provide different types of information, integrating these modalities may aid in elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying certain diseases, and in characterizing individual patients.

A vascular-task response dependency and its application in functional imaging of brain tumors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						fMRI; Brain tumors; Vascular reactivity; Breath holding; Neurosurgery	BOLD CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; HYPERCAPNIC NORMALIZATION; FMRI; MRI; MOTOR; ACTIVATION; LANGUAGE; OXYGENATION; VARIABILITY; CALIBRATION	Purpose: Preoperative functional MRI (fMRI) is limited by a muted BOLD response caused by abnormal vasoreactivity and resultant neurovascular uncoupling adjacent to malignant brain tumors. We propose to overcome this limitation and more accurately identify eloquent areas adjacent to brain tumors by independently assessing vasoreactivity using breath-holding and incorporating these data into the fMRI analysis. Methods: Local vasoreactivity using a breath-holding paradigm with the same timing as the functional motor and language tasks was determined in 16 patients (9 glioblastomas, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 5 low grade astrocytomas, and 1 metastasis) and 6 healthy control subjects. We derived an fMRI model based on an observed vaso-task response dependency that takes into account the altered hemodynamics adjacent to brain tumors. Results: In both healthy controls and brain tumor subjects, we found a statistical dependency between breath hold and task BOLD response. In tumor subjects, activation maps that take into account this vaso-task dependency demonstrated clinically meaningful areas of activation that were not seen using the task-only analysis in about half of the cases studied. This included localization of language areas adjacent to brain tumors. Conclusions: The present preliminary results demonstrate that neurovascular uncoupling known to affect the accuracy of BOLD fMRI adjacent to brain tumors may be, at least partially, overcome by incorporating an observed vaso-task dependency in the BOLD signal analysis.

For this research program to be successful two questions require satisfactory answers. First, as the fMRI method can currently only be used on stationary subjects, to what extent can neuropsychological tests applicable to such stationary subjects be correlated with normal behavior. Second, to what extent can correlations between the various neuropsychological tests on the one hand, and sites of brain activity determined with fMRI on the other, be regarded as established. The extent to which these questions have yet received satisfactory answers is reviewed, and suggestions made both for improving correlations of neuropsychological tests with behavior as well as with the results of fMRI-based observations.

Methods: Twenty children aged 12-14 years completed two cognitive trials, in a randomized counterbalanced order, one under fasting condition, one after consuming breakfast, during which continuous fMRI data were acquired. Results: Although no statistically significant (P > 0.05) improvement in task performance was determined, significantly higher activation was recorded in the frontal, premotor, and primary visual cortex areas in the breakfast trial relative to the fasting condition. Discussion: Such a finding may have important implications in the examination of the role of diet, and specifically breakfast, in determining children's performance within the school environment.

However, rs-fMRI in infants has universally been obtained during sleep to reduce participant motion artifact, raising the question of whether differences in functional organization between awake adults and sleeping infants that are commonly attributed to development may instead derive, at least in part, from sleep. This question is especially important as rs-fMRI differences in adult wake vs. sleep are well documented. To investigate this question, we compared functional connectivity and BOLD signal propagation patterns in 6, 12, and 24 month old sleeping infants with patterns in adult wakefulness and non-REM sleep. We find that important functional connectivity features seen during infant sleep closely resemble those seen during adult sleep, including reduced default mode network functional connectivity. However, we also find differences between infant and adult sleep, especially in thalamic BOLD signal propagation patterns. These findings highlight the importance of considering sleep state when drawing developmental inferences in infant rs-fMRI.

However, little is known about the physical and physiological underpinnings of MVPA in fMRI as well as about the effect of spatial smoothing on its performance. Several studies have addressed these issues, but their investigation was limited to the visual cortex at 3 T with conflicting results. Here, we used ultra-high field (7 T) fMRI to investigate the effect of spatial resolution and smoothing on decoding of speech content (vowels) and speaker identity from auditory cortical responses. To that end, we acquired high-resolution (1.1 mm isotropic) fMRI data and additionally reconstructed them at 2.2 and 3.3 mm in-plane spatial resolutions from the original k-space data. Furthermore, the data at each resolution were spatially smoothed with different 3D Gaussian kernel sizes (i.e. no smoothing or 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, or 8.8 mm kernels). For all spatial resolutions and smoothing kernels, we demonstrate the feasibility of decoding speech content (vowel) and speaker identity at 7 T using support vector machine (SVM) MVPA. In addition, we found that high spatial frequencies are informative for vowel decoding and that the relative contribution of high and low spatial frequencies is different across the two decoding tasks. Moderate smoothing (up to 2.2 mm) improved the accuracies for both decoding of vowels and speakers, possibly due to reduction of noise (e.g. residual motion artifacts or instrument noise) while still preserving information at high spatial frequency. In summary, our results show that - even with the same stimuli and within the same brain areas-the optimal spatial resolution for MVPA in fMRI depends on the specific decoding task of interest.

A long scan time would result in fatigue and restlessness in participants, while a short scan time is undesirable for an STS-fMRI due to insufficient Ns for averaging. The purpose of this study was to determine the Ns practically sufficient for a sparse fMRI study. Eighteen participants were presented with white noise during a sparse fMRI scan. The height extent of activation was determined via t statistics and region of interest (ROI) based percentage of signal change (PSC). The t statistics and PSC for Heschl's gyrus (HG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) during which the participants listened to the white noise were calculated for different number of scans which were 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36. The t statistics and PSC values calculated for the bilateral HG and STG qualitatively indicated a minimal change over N-s = 12 to 36. Both ROIs showed a consistent common right lateralization of activation for all N-s, indicating the right-hemispheric dominance of auditory cortex in processing white noise stimulus. It was proposed that for a sparse fMRI study, N-s may practically fall between 12 and 36.

However, the debate surrounding whether the origin of this response phase is neuronal or vascular, and whether it provides functionally relevant information, that is additional to what is contained in the primary response, means that undershoots are widely overlooked. We simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG), BOLD and cerebral blood-flow (CBF) [obtained from arterial spin labelled (ASL) fMRI] fMRI responses to hemifield checkerboard stimulation to test the potential neural origin of the fMRI post-stimulus undershoot. The post-stimulus BOLD and CBF signal amplitudes in both contralateral and ipsilateral visual cortex depended on the post-stimulus power of the occipital 8-13 Hz (alpha) EEG neuronal activity, such that trials with highest EEG power showed largest fMRI undershoots in contralateral visual cortex. This correlation in post-stimulus EEG-fMRI responses was not predicted by the primary response amplitude. In the contralateral visual cortex we observed a decrease in both cerebral rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) and CBF during the post-stimulus phase. In addition, the coupling ratio (n) between CMRO2 and CBF was significantly lower during the positive contralateral primary response phase compared with the post-stimulus phase and we propose that this reflects an altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. Together our data provide strong evidence that the post-stimulus phase of the BOLD response has a neural origin which reflects, at least partially, an uncoupling of the neuronal responses driving the primary and post-stimulus responses, explaining the uncoupling of the signals measured in the two response phases. We suggest our results are consistent with inhibitory processes driving the post-stimulus EEG and fMRI responses. We therefore propose that new methods are required to model the post-stimulus and primary responses independently, enabling separate investigation of response phases in cognitive function and neurological disease.

However, direct training of a DNN with fMRI data is often avoided because the size of available data is thought to be insufficient for training a complex network with numerous parameters. Instead, a pre-trained DNN usually serves as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, and fMRI data are used to decode individual DNN features of a stimulus image using a simple linear model, which are then passed to a reconstruction module. Here, we directly trained a DNN model with fMRI data and the corresponding stimulus images to build an end-to-end reconstruction model. We accomplished this by training a generative adversarial network with an additional loss term that was defined in high-level feature space (feature loss) using up to 6,000 training data samples (natural images and fMRI responses). The above model was tested on independent datasets and directly reconstructed image using an fMRI pattern as the input. Reconstructions obtained from our proposed method resembled the test stimuli (natural and artificial images) and reconstruction accuracy increased as a function of training-data size. Ablation analyses indicated that the feature loss that we employed played a critical role in achieving accurate reconstruction. Our results show that the end-to-end model can learn a direct mapping between brain activity and perception.

However, whether the group difference derived from univariate analysis could be useful for informing the diagnosis of individual OCD patients remains unclear. We aimed to apply multivariate pattern analysis of different rs-fMRI parameters to distinguish drug-naive patients with OCD from healthy control subjects (HCS). Fifty-four drug-naive OCD patients and 54 well-matched HCS were recruited. Four different rs-fMRI parameter maps, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity strength (FCS), were calculated. Training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using rs-fMRI maps produced voxelwise discrimination maps. Overall, the classification accuracies were acceptable for the four rs-fMRI parameters. Excellent performance was achieved when ALFF maps were employed (accuracy, 95.37%, p < 0.01), good performance was achieved by using ReHo maps, weaker performance was achieved by using fALFF maps, and fair performance was achieved by using FCS maps. The brain regions showing the greatest discriminative power included the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, and occipital lobes. The application of SVM to rs-fMRI features may provide potential power for OCD classification.

Current methods and limitations for longitudinal fMRI analysis across development	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Longitudinal modeling; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); General Linear Model; Structural Equation Modeling; Developmental change	WORKING-MEMORY; GROWTH-CURVES; NEURAL BASES; RISK-TAKING; AGE; CHILDREN; BRAIN; ADOLESCENCE; MATURATION; CHILDHOOD	The human brain is remarkably plastic. The brain changes dramatically across development, with ongoing functional development continuing well into the third decade of life and substantial changes occurring again in older age. Dynamic changes in brain function are thought to underlie the innumerable changes in cognition, emotion, and behavior that occur across development. The brain also changes in response to experience, which raises important questions about how the environment influences the developing brain. Longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are an essential means of understanding these developmental changes and their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral correlates. This paper provides an overview of common statistical models of longitudinal change applicable to developmental cognitive neuroscience, and a review of the functionality provided by major software packages for longitudinal fMRI analysis. We demonstrate that there are important developmental questions that cannot be answered using available software. We propose alternative approaches for addressing problems that are commonly faced in modeling developmental change with fMRI data.

Specifically, high-level and perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous electro-encephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal characterization of brain-network interactions combined with improved anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12 males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely encoded in frontal "late" regions on perceptual processes occurring in "early" perceptual regions.

Methods: 157 IED types, each corresponding to one EEG scalp distribution, in 64 consecutive EEG-fMRI studies from 64 patients with refractory localization-related epilepsy were reviewed. To determine reliable activation, we used the threshold corresponding to corrected whole-brain topological false discovery rate (FDR). The location with maximum activation was compared to the presumed SOZ as defined by a comprehensive evaluation for each patient. Results: The number of IEDs was significantly higher in the types with t-value above FDR than with t-value below FDR. The presumed SOZ could be delineated in 30 of the 64 patients. Among these patients, the types of IED concordant with the SOZ had significantly larger extent on scalp EEG than the IED types discordant with the SOZ. Conclusions: The number of IEDs is important factor in obtaining reliable activations in EEG-fMRI. IEDs with larger spatial extent are more likely to reveal, on maximum BOLD, accurate location of the SOZ. Significance: Widespread discharges are more likely to yield a reliable activation for SOZ in EEG-fMRI. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Expectation modulates repetition priming under high stimulus variability	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						face perception; fMRI adaptation; repetition suppression; response priming; predictive coding	FMRI-ADAPTATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; SUPPRESSION; PROBABILITY; MECHANISMS; PERCEPTION; MEMORY; TIME; SELECTIVITY; REDUCTIONS	Neural responses to stimuli are often attenuated by repeated presentation. When observed in blood oxygen level-dependent signals, this attenuation is known as fMRI adaptation (fMRIa) or fMRI repetition suppression. According to a prominent account, fMRIa reflects the fulfillment of perceptual expectations during recognition of repeated items (Summerfield, Trittschuh, Monti, Mesulam, & Egner, 2008). Supporting this idea, expectation has been shown to modulate fMRIa under some circumstances; however, it is not currently known whether expectation similarly modulates recognition performance. To address this lacuna, we measured behavioral and fMRI responses to faces while varying the extent to which each stimulus was informative about its successor. Behavioral priming was greater when repetitions were more likely, suggesting that recognition was facilitated by the expectation than an item would repeat. Notably, this effect was only observed when stimuli were drawn from a broad set of faces including many ethnicities and both genders, but not when stimuli were drawn from a narrower face set, thus making repetitions less informative. Moreover, expectation did not modulate fMRIa in face-selective cortex, contrary to previous studies, although an exploratory analysis indicated that it did so in a medial frontal region. These results support the idea that expectation modulates recognition efficiency, but insofar as behavioral effects of expectation were not accompanied by fMRI effects in visual cortex, they suggest that fMRIa cannot be entirely explained in terms of fulfilled expectations.

J	Cox, RW				Cox, Robert W.			Equitable Thresholding and Clustering: A Novel Method for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clustering in AFNI	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						clustering; false-positive rates; FMRI; group analysis	RANDOM-FIELD	This article describes a hybrid method to threshold functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) group statistical maps derived from voxel-wise second-level statistical analyses. The proposed "Equitable Thresholding and Clustering" (ETAC) approach seeks to reduce the dependence of clustering results on arbitrary parameter values by using multiple subtests, each equivalent to a standard FMRI clustering analysis, to make decisions about which groups of voxels are potentially significant. The union of these subtest results decides which voxels are accepted. The approach adjusts the cluster-thresholding parameter of each subtest in an equitable way, so that the individual false-positive rates (FPRs) are balanced across subtests to achieve a desired final FPR (e.g., 5%). ETAC utilizes resampling methods to estimate the FPR and thus does not rely on parametric assumptions about the spatial correlation of FMRI noise. The approach was validated with pseudotask timings in resting-state brain data. In addition, a task FMRI data collection was used to compare ETACs true positive detection power versus a standard cluster detection method, demonstrating that ETAC is able to detect true results and control false positives while reducing reliance on arbitrary analysis parameters.

Among these, the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact is the most challenging, due to its complex spatio-temporal dynamics associated with ongoing cardiac activity. The presence of BCG residuals in EEG data may hide true, or generate spurious correlations between EEG and fMRI time-courses. Here, we propose an adaptive Optimal Basis Set (aOBS) method for BCG artifact removal. Our method is adaptive, as it can estimate the delay between cardiac activity and BCG occurrence on a beat-to-beat basis. The effective creation of an optimal basis set by principal component analysis (PCA) is therefore ensured by a more accurate alignment of BCG occurrences. Furthermore, aOBS can automatically estimate which components produced by PCA are likely to be BCG artifact-related and therefore need to be removed. The aOBS performance was evaluated on high-density EEG data acquired with simultaneous fMRI in healthy subjects during visual stimulation.

J	Kafashan, M; Palanca, BA; Ching, S				Kafashan, MohammadMehdi; Palanca, Ben Julian A.; Ching, ShiNung			Dimensionality reduction impedes the extraction of dynamic functional connectivity states from fMRI recordings of resting wakefulness	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Resting-state functional magnetic resonance; Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC); FC state analysis; Spatiotemporal analysis	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN NETWORKS; MRI; MOTION; MEMORY; CONNECTOMICS; PERCEPTION; VOLUNTARY	Background: Resting wakefulness is not a unitary state, with evidence accumulating that spontaneous reorganization of brain activity can be assayed through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The dynamics of correlated fMRI signals among functionally-related brain regions, termed dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), may represent nonstationarity arising from underlying neural processes. However, given the dimensionality and noise inherent in such recordings, seeming fluctuations in dFC could be due to sampling variability or artifacts. New method: Here, we highlight key methodological considerations when evaluating dFC in resting-state fMRI data. Comparison with existing method: In particular, we demonstrate how dimensionality reduction of fMRI data, a common practice often involving principal component analysis, may give rise to spurious dFC phenomenology due to its effect of decorrelating the underlying time-series. Conclusion: We formalize a dFC assessment that avoids dimensionality reduction and use it to show the existence of at least two FC states in the resting-state. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We used fMRI to investigate in 30 healthy right-handed and right-footed subjects the regional distribution of brain activity during position matching tasks performed with the right dominant and the left nondominant foot. Along with the brain activation, we assessed the performance during both ipsilateral and contralateral matching tasks. Subjects had lower errors when matching was performed by the left nondominant foot. The fMRI analysis suggested that the significant regions responsible for position sense are in the right parietal and frontal cortex, providing a first characterization of the neural correlates of foot position matching.

However, whether there consistently exist DFC states associated with wakefulness and sleep stages and what are the characteristics and electrophysiological origin of these states remain unclear. The aims of the current study were to investigate the properties of DFC in different sleep stages and to explore the relationship between the characteristics of DFC and slow-wave activity. We collected both eyes-closed wakefulness and sleep data from 48 healthy young volunteers with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. EEG data were employed as the gold standard of sleep stage scoring, and DFC states were estimated based on fMRI data. The results demonstrated that DFC states of the fMRI signals consistently corresponded to wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement sleep stages independent of the number of clusters. Furthermore, the mean dwell time of these states significantly correlated with slow-wave activity. The inclusion or omission of regression of the global signal and the selection of parcellation schemes exerted minimal effects on the current findings. These results provide strong evidence that DFC states underlying fMRI signals match the fluctuations of vigilance and suggest a possible electrophysiological source of DFC states corresponding to vigilance states.

Methods: T-values within the visual cortex obtained with analysis tools that assume a first-order autoregressive plus white noise process (AR(1)+w) with a fixed AR coefficient versus higher-order AR models with spatially varying AR coefficients were compared. In addition, dependency of T-values on correction of physiological noise (respiration, heart rate) was evaluated. Results: Optimal statistical power was obtained for a TR of 0.33 s, but T-values as obtained by AR(1) +w models were strongly dependent on the predefined AR coefficients in fMRI with short TRs which required higher-order AR models to achieve stable statistics. Direct estimation of AR coefficients revealed the highest values within the default mode network while physiological noise had little influence on statistics in cortical structures. Conclusion: Colored noise in event-related fMRI obtained at short TRs originates mainly from neural sources and calls for more sophisticated correction of serial autocorrelations which cannot be achieved with standard methods relying on AR(1)+w models with globally fixed AR coefficients.

Since fMRI allows the mapping of spatial and temporal patterns of activity in multiple brain regions simultaneously, it serves as a powerful tool to study olfactory dysfunction in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Nonetheless, there have been no reports to date of mapping odor-induced activation patterns beyond the olfactory bulb to the extended networks of olfactory and limbic archicortex, likely due to the small size of the mouse brain. Therefore, using an 11.7 T magnet and a blood volume-weighted fMRI technique, we mapped the functional neuroanatomy of the mouse olfactory system. Consistent with reports on imaging of the much larger human brain, we mapped activity in regions of the olfactory bulb, as well as olfactory and limbic archicortex. By using two distinct odorants, we further demonstrated odorant-specific activation patterns. Our work thus provides a methodological framework for fMRI studies of olfactory dysfunction in mouse models of neurodegeneration.

Connectivity changes after laser ablation: Resting-state fMRI	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Resting-state functional MRI; Independent component analysis; Stereotactic laser ablation; Functional connectivity; Pediatric epilepsy surgery; Brain mapping	FUNCTIONAL MRI; CORTEX	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is emerging as a useful tool in the multimodal assessment of patients with epilepsy. In pediatric patients who cannot perform task-based fMRI, rsfMRI may present an adjunct and alternative. Although changes in brain activation during task-based fMRI have been described after surgery for epilepsy, there is limited data on the role of postoperative rsfMRI. In this short review, we discuss the role of postoperative rsfMRI after laser ablation of seizure foci. By establishing standardized anesthesia protocols and imaging parameters, we have been able to perform serial rsfMRI at postoperative follow-up. The development of in-house software that can merge rsfMRI images to surgical navigation systems has allowed us to enhance the clinical applications of this technique. Resting-state fMRI after laser ablation has the potential to identify changes in connectivity, localize new seizure foci, and guide antiepileptic therapy. In our experience, rsfMRI complements conventional MR imaging and task-based fMRI for the evaluation of patients with seizure recurrence after laser ablation, and represents a potential noninvasive biomarker for functional connectivity.

Particularly, we focus on one specific long-standing challenge in the computational modeling of fMRI datasets: how to effectively explore typical functional interactions from fMRI time series and the corresponding boundaries of temporal segments. Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference which has been shown to be a powerful tool to encode dependence relationships among the variables with uncertainty. Here we provide an introduction to a group of Bayesian-inference-based methods for fMRI data analysis, which were designed to detect magnitude or functional connectivity change points and to infer their functional interaction patterns based on corresponding temporal boundaries. We also provide a comparison of three popular Bayesian models, that is, Bayesian Magnitude Change Point Model (BMCPM), Bayesian Connectivity Change PointModel (BCCPM), and Dynamic Bayesian Variable Partition Model (DBVPM), and give a summary of their applications. We envision that more delicate Bayesian inference models will be emerging and play increasingly important roles in modeling brain functions in the years to come.

Optogenetic fMRI interrogation of brain-wide central vestibular pathways	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						fMRI; vestibular system; optogenetic; medial vestibular nucleus; vestibular functions	OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RAT; NUCLEI; PROJECTIONS; NEURONS; SYSTEM; DIRECTION; MOTION; CORTEX	Blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (fMRI) constitutes a powerful neuroimaging technology to map brain-wide functions in response to specific sensory or cognitive tasks. However, fMRI mapping of the vestibular system, which is pivotal for our sense of balance, poses significant challenges. Physical constraints limit a subject's ability to perform motion- and balance-related tasks inside the scanner, and current stimulation techniques within the scanner are nonspecific to delineate complex vestibular nucleus (VN) pathways. Using fMRI, we examined brain-wide neural activity patterns elicited by optogenetically stimulating excitatory neurons of a major vestibular nucleus, the ipsilateral medial VN (MVN). We demonstrated robust optogenetically evoked fMRI activations bilaterally at sensorimotor cortices and their associated thalamic nuclei (auditory, visual, somatosensory, and motor), high-order cortices (cingulate, retrosplenial, temporal association, and parietal), and hippocampal formations (dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum). We then examined the modulatory effects of the vestibular system on sensory processing using auditory and visual stimulation in combination with optogenetic excitation of the MVN. We found enhanced responses to sound in the auditory cortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus ipsilateral to the stimulated MVN. In the visual pathway, we observed enhanced responses to visual stimuli in the ipsilateral visual cortex, thalamus, and contralateral superior colliculus. Taken together, our imaging findings reveal multiple brain-wide central vestibular pathways. We demonstrate large-scale modulatory effects of the vestibular system on sensory processing.

Setting: Neurorehabilitation clinic. Participants: Patients with traumatic brain injury received either placebo (n = 24) or active treatment (n = 28). Healthy controls (n = 27) went through fMRI examination at one point and were used in sensitivity analysis on normalization of BOLD response. Design: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design. Main Measures: Effects on BOLD signal changes from before to after treatment during performance of a fatiguing attention task. Results: The fMRI results revealed treatment effects within the right occipitotemporal cortex and the right orbitofrontal cortex. In these regions, the BOLD response was normalized relative to healthy controls at the postintervention fMRI session. No effects were seen in regions in which we previously observed activity differences between patients and healthy controls while performing this fMRI task, such as the striatum. Conclusion: (-)-OSU6162 treatment had influences on functional brain activity, although the normalized regional BOLD response was observed in regions that were not a priori hypothesized to be sensitive to this particular treatment, and was not accompanied by any effects on in-scanner test performance or on fatigue.

Several studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have reported that most chronic pain diseases are accompanied by structural and functional changes in the brain. However, few rs-fMRI studies have examined CNSP. The current study investigated cerebral structural and functional changes in CNSP patients. Methods: In total, 25 CNSP patients and 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. 3D-T1W and rs-fMRI images were acquired. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was applied to structural images, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) was extracted from rs-fMRI. Statistical analysis was performed on post-processing images and ReHo parameter maps. Results: The results revealed no significant differences in brain structure between the two groups. In the patient group, ReHo values were significantly increased in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus and decreased in the left insula, superior frontal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area, right postcentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. Conclusions: This initial structural and rs-fMRI study of CNSP revealed characteristic features of spontaneous brain activity of CNSP patients. These findings may be helpful for increasing our understanding of the neuropathology of CNSP.

Previous studies have investigated the neural correlates of creative insight by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), however, the intrinsic resting-state brain activity associated with creative insight is still unclear. In the present study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo) as an index in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain regions involved in individual differences in creative insight, which was compued by the response time (RT) of creative Chinese character chunk decomposition. The findings indicated that ReHo in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/caudate nucleus (CN) and angular gyrus (AG)/superior temporal gyrus (STG)/inferior parietal lobe (IPL) negatively predicted creative insight. Furthermore, these findings suggested that spontaneous brain activity in multiple regions related to breaking and establishing mental sets, goal-directed solutions exploring, shifting attention, forming new associations and emotion experience contributes to creative insight. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence to further understand the cognitive processing and neural correlates of creative insight.

Aberrant activity in conceptual networks underlies N400 deficits and unusual thoughts in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Semantic priming; N400; Joint-ICA; fMRI	SEMANTIC SYSTEM; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN; FMRI; WORDS; BOLD; ABNORMALITIES; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; COMPONENT	Background: The N400 event-related potential (ERP) is triggered by meaningful stimuli that are incongruous, or unmatched, with their semantic context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified brain regions activated by semantic incongruity, but their precise links to the N400 ERP are unclear. In schizophrenia (SZ), N400 amplitude reduction is thought to reflect overly broad associations in semantic networks, but the abnormalities in brain networks underlying deficient N400 remain unknown. We utilized joint independent component analysis (JICA) to link temporal patterns in ERPs to neuroanatomical patterns from fMRI and investigate relationships between N400 amplitude and neuroanatomical activation in SZ patients and healthy controls (HC). Methods: SZ patients (n = 24) and HC participants (n = 25) performed a picture-word matching task, in which words were either matched (APPLE -> apple) by preceding pictures, or were unmatched by semantically related (in-category; IC, APPLE -> lemon) or unrelated (out of category; OC, APPLE -> cow) pictures, in separate ERP and fMRI sessions. A JICA "data fusion" analysis was conducted to identify the fMRI brain regions specifically associated with the ERP N400 component. SZ and HC loading weights were compared and correlations with clinical symptoms were assessed. Results: JICA identified an ERP-fMRI "fused" component that captured the N400, with loading weights that were reduced in SZ. The JICA map for the IC condition showed peaks of activation in the cingulate, precuneus, bilateral temporal poles and cerebellum, whereas the JICA map from the OC condition was linked primarily to visual cortical activation and the left temporal pole. Among SZ patients, fMRI activity from the IC condition was inversely correlated with unusual thought content. Conclusions: The neural networks associated with the N400 ERP response to semantic violations depends on conceptual relatedness. These findings are consistent with a distributed network underlying neural responses to semantic incongruity including unimodal visual areas as well as integrative, transmodal areas. Unusual thoughts in SZ may reflect impaired processing in transmodal hub regions such as the precuneus, leading to overly broad semantic associations.

Despite the fact that rTMS is being used in a clinical setting and animal studies are increasingly identifying potential cellular and molecular mechanisms, little is known about how these mechanisms relate to clinical changes. This knowledge gap is amplified by non-overlapping approaches used in preclinical and clinical rTMS studies: preclinical studies are mostly invasive, using cellular and molecular approaches, while clinical studies are non-invasive, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), TMS electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and behavioral measures. A non-invasive method is therefore needed in rodents to link our understanding of cellular and molecular changes to functional connectivity changes that are clinically relevant. fMRI is the technique of choice for examining both short and long term functional connectivity changes in large-scale networks and is becoming increasingly popular in animal research because of its high translatability, but, to date, there have been no reports of animal rTMS studies using this technique. This review summarizes the main studies combining different rTMS protocols with fMRI in humans, in both healthy and patient populations, providing a foundation for the design of equivalent studies in animals. We discuss the challenges of combining these two methods in animals and highlight considerations important for acquiring clinically-relevant information from combined rTMS/fMRI studies in animals. We believe that combining rTMS and fMRI in animal models will generate new knowledge in the following ways: functional connectivity changes can be explored in greater detail through complementary invasive procedures, clarifying mechanism and improving the therapeutic application of rTMS, as well as improving interpretation of fMRI data. And, in a more general context, a robust comparative approach will refine the use of animal models of specific neuropsychiatric conditions.

Study of tonotopic brain changes with functional MRI and FDG-PET in a patient with unilateral objective cochlear tinnitus	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Objective tinnitus; Human neuroimaging; Auditory cortex; Tonotopy	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION; ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT; PLASTICITY; HEARING; REORGANIZATION; ORGANIZATION; TRAUMA; FMRI	We studied possible brain changes with functional MRI (fMRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a patient with a rare, high-intensity "objective tinnitus" (high-level SOAEs) in the left ear of 10 years duration, with no associated hearing loss. This is the first case of objective cochlear tinnitus to be investigated with functional neuroimaging. The objective cochlear tinnitus was measured by Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions (SOAE) equipment (frequency 9689 Hz, intensity 57 dB SPL) and is clearly audible to anyone standing near the patient. Functional modifications in primary auditory areas and other brain regions were evaluated using 3T and 7T fMRI and FDG-PET. In the fMRI evaluations, a saturation of the auditory cortex at the tinnitus frequency was observed, but the global cortical tonotopic organization remained intact when compared to the results of fMRI of healthy subjects. The FDG-PET showed no evidence of an increase or decrease of activity in the auditory cortices or in the limbic system as compared to normal subjects. In this patient with high-intensity objective cochlear tinnitus, fMRI and FDG-PET showed no significant brain reorganization in auditory areas and/or in the limbic system, as reported in the literature in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus.

This has been studied in mice and humans using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Here we demonstrate that BOLD effects observed in the murine neuromatrix in response to salient somatosensory stimuli are prone to reflect mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) changes, rather than neural activity. We show that a standard electrostimulus typically used in murine somatosensory fMRI can induce substantial elevations in MABP. Equivalent drug-induced MABP changes - without somatosensory stimulation - evoked BOLD patterns in the neuromatrix strikingly similar to those evoked by electrostimulation. This constitutes a serious caveat for murine fMRI. The regional specificity of these BOLD patterns can be attributed to the co-localization of the neuromatrix with large draining veins. Based on these findings we propose a cardiovascular support mechanism whereby abrupt elevations in MABP provide additional energy supply to the neuromatrix and other essential brain areas in fight-or-flight situations.

Consequently, their application in neuroscience is rapidly increasing. While classification approaches have proved useful in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, there are concerns regarding extraction, reproducibility and visualization of brain regions that contribute most significantly to the classification. We addressed these issues using an fMRI classification scheme based on neural networks and compared a set of methods for extraction of category-related voxel importances in three simulated and two empirical datasets. The simulation data revealed that the proposed scheme successfully detects spatially distributed and overlapping activation patterns upon successful classification. Application of the proposed classification scheme to two previously published empirical fMRI datasets revealed robust importance maps that extensively overlap with univariate maps but also provide complementary information. Our results demonstrate increased statistical power of importance maps compared to univariate approaches for both detection of overlapping patterns and patterns with weak univariate information.

We compared activation profiles on a semantic monitoring task using one of the two designs in a total of 43 healthy individual to determine whether task design or subject-specific factors (i.e., age, sex, or language performance) influence activation patterns. We found high concordance between the two designs within core language regions, including the inferior frontal, posterior temporal, and basal temporal region. However, differences emerged within inferior parietal cortex. Subject specific factors did not influence activation patterns, nor did they interact with task design. These results suggest that despite high concordance within perisylvian regions that are robust to subject-specific factors, methodological differences between blocked and event-related designs may contribute to parietal activations. These findings provide important information for researchers incorporating fMRI results into meta-analytic studies, as well as for clinicians using fMRI to guide pre-surgical planning.

In the present study using concurrent high-density EEG and recently developed high-speed fMRI methods, we investigate safety of radiofrequency (RF) related heating, the effect of EEG on cortical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI, and assess EEG data quality. Materials and methods The study compared EPI, multi-echo EPI, multi-band EPI and multi-slab echo-volumar imaging pulse sequences, using clinical 3 Tesla MR scanners from two different vendors that were equipped with 64- and 256-channel MR-compatible EEG systems, respectively, and receive only array head coils. Data were collected in 11 healthy controls (3 males, age range 18-70 years) and 13 patients with epilepsy (8 males, age range 21-67 years). Three of the healthy controls were scanned with the 256-channel EEG system, the other subjects were scanned with the 64-channel EEG system. Scalp surface temperature, SNR in occipital cortex and head movement were measured with and without the EEG cap. The degree of artifacts and the ability to identify background activity was assessed by visual analysis by a trained expert in the 64 channel EEG data (7 healthy controls, 13 patients). Results RF induced heating at the surface of the EEG electrodes during a 30-minute scan period with stable temperature prior to scanning did not exceed 1.0 degrees C with either EEG system and any of the pulse sequences used in this study. There was no significant decrease in cortical SNR due to the presence of the EEG cap (p > 0.05). No significant differences in the visually analyzed EEG data quality were found between EEG recorded during high-speed fMRI and during conventional EPI (p = 0.78). Residual ballistocardiographic artifacts resulted in 58% of EEG data being rated as poor quality. Conclusion This study demonstrates that high-density EEG can be safely implemented in conjunction with high-speed fMRI and that high-speed fMRI does not adversely affect EEG data quality. However, the deterioration of the EEG quality due to residual ballistocardiographic artifacts remains a significant constraint for routine clinical applications of concurrent EEG-fMRI.

However, acute alcohol consumption, and/or life history of alcoholism, may blunt amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli. Thus, we examined the influence of a past history of DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) on the fMRI BOLD AMYG response to anger faces in IED. Method: Forty-two IED participants, 18 with a past history of AUD (IED+AUD) and 24 without Past AUD (IED), and 32 healthy control (HC) participants, underwent fMRI scanning while viewing blocks of angry, fearful, and happy faces. Results: Compared to HC and IED+AUD participants, IED subjects exhibited greater AMYG responses to angry, but not to fear or happy, faces in the left AMYG. There were no group differences in responses to anger, fear, or happy, faces in the OFC. Conclusion: These findings suggest the possibility of a longstanding effect of AUD on AMYG response in IED to anger-related stimuli and highlight the possibility that history of AUD should be considered as an important factor in the interpretation of fMRI studies involving the AMYG response to negative emotional stimuli.

Degenerative changes in brain structure and decline in its function are associated with declines in cognitive ability. Early detection of AD is a key priority in dementia services and research. However, depending on the disease progression, neurodegenerative manifestations, such as cerebral atrophy, are detected late in course of AD. Functional changes in the brain may be an indirect indicator of trans-synaptic activity and they usually appear prior to structural changes in AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has recently been highlighted as a new technique for interrogating intrinsic functional connectivity networks. Among the majority of RS-fMRI studies, the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN) gained particular focus because alterations to their functional connectivity were observed in subjects who had AD, who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or who were at high risk for AD. Herein, we present a review of the current research on changes in functional connectivity, as measured by RS-fMRI. We focus on the DMN, SN, and CEN to describe RS-fMRI results from three groups: normal healthy aging, MCI and AD.

The diagnosis and treatment of PD have gained more attention for clinical researchers. While there have been many fMRI studies about functional topological changes of PD patients, whether the dynamic changes of functional connectivity can predict the drug therapy effect is still unclear. The primary objective of this study was to assess whether large-scale functional efficiency changes of topological network are detectable in PD patients, and to explore whether the severity level (UPDRS-III) after drug treatment can be predicted by the pre-treatment resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Here, we recruited 62 Parkinson's disease patients and calculated the dynamic nodal efficiency networks based on rs-fMRI. With connectome-based predictive models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, we demonstrated that the dynamic nodal efficiency properties predict drug therapy effect well. The contributed regions for the prediction include hippocampus, post-central gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and orbital gyrus. Specifically, the connections between hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and insular gyrus, insular gyrus, and orbital gyrus are positively related to the recovery (post-therapy severity level) after drug therapy. The analysis of these connection features may provide important information for clinical treatment of PD patients.

Material/Methods: This retrospective study included 17 MAP patients, 16 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients, and 18 healthy controls. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the clinical assessment, the severity of clinical symptoms was evaluated prior to the fMRI scanning, and then images were acquired and preprocessed after each participant received 6-min fRMI scanning. The participants all underwent BOLD-fMRI scanning. Voxel-based morphometry was used to measure gray matter density (GMD). Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was conducted to analyze functional MR, ReHo, and functional connectivity (FC). Results: GMD analysis results suggest that MAP patients, SCZ patients, and healthy volunteers show different GMDs within different brain regions. Similarly, the ReHo analysis results suggest that MAP patients, SCZ patients, and healthy volunteers have different GMDs within different brain regions. Negative correlations were found between ReHo- and the PANSS-positive scores within the left orbital interior frontal gyrus (L-orb-IFG) of MAP patients. ReHo-and PANSS-negative scores of R-SFG were negatively correlated among SCZ patients. The abnormal FC of R-MFG showed a negative correlation with the PANSS score among MAP patients. Conclusions: The abnormalities in brain structure and FC were associated with the development of MAP.

In this study, we investigated whether there is an association between resting state functional brain connectivity (RsFC) and seizure control in TLE. We screened a large database containing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data from 286 epilepsy patients. Patient medical records were screened for seizure characterization, EEG reports for lateralization and location of seizure foci to establish uniformity of seizure localization within patient groups. Rs-fMRI data from patients with well-controlled left TLE, patients with treatment-resistant left TLE, and healthy controls were analyzed. Healthy controls and cTLE showed similar functional connectivity patterns, whereas trTLE exhibited a significant bilateral decrease in thalamo-hippocampal functional connectivity. This work is the first to demonstrate differences in neural network connectivity between well-controlled and treatment-resistant TLE. These differences are spatially highly focused and suggest sites for the etiology and possibly treatment of TLE. Altered thalamo-hippocampal RsFC thus is a potential new biomarker for TLE treatment resistance.

Despite such developments, characterizing regulation and cerebral representation of mind wandering, which occurs unavoidably during resting-state fMRI scans and may induce variability of the acquired data, remains a work in progress. Here, we demonstrate that a decrease or decoupling in functional connectivity involving the caudate nucleus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex and other domain-specific regions was associated with more sustained mind wandering in particular thought domains during resting-state fMRI. Importantly, our findings suggest that temporal and between-subject variations in functional connectivity of above-mentioned regions might be linked with the continuity of mind wandering. Our study not only provides a preliminary framework for characterizing the maintenance and cerebral representation of different types of mind wandering, but also highlights the importance of taking mind wandering into consideration when studying brain organization with resting-state fMRI in the future.

Early-life stress exposure associated with altered prefrontal resting-state fMRI connectivity in young children	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Early-life stress; Resting-state fMRI; Prefrontal cortex; Development; Cognitive control	DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; DEPRIVATION; DISORDER; AMYGDALA; CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL; NETWORKS; SPECTRUM	Early-life stress (ELS) exposure is associated with adverse outcomes across the lifespan. We examined the relation of ELS exposure to resting-state fMRI in children ages 4-7 years. ELS in the first years of life, but not concurrent, was associated with higher regional homogeneity of resting-state fMRI in the left lateral frontal cortex. Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analyses showed that the region of left lateral frontal cortex demonstrating heightened regional homogeneity associated with ELS was negatively correlated with right temporal/parahippocampal areas. Moreover, higher regional homogeneity in the left lateral frontal cortex and its negative coupling with the right middle temporal/parahippocampal areas were associated with poorer performance on a reversal-learning task performed outside the scanner. Association of ELS exposure with regional homogeneity was independent of other early adversities. These findings suggest that ELS may influence the development of cognitive control in the lateral prefrontal cortex and its interactions with temporal cortex. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Here, single-vessel fMRI reveals vessel-specific correlation patterns in both rodents and humans. In anesthetized rats, fluctuations in the vessel-specific fMRI signal are correlated with the intracellular calcium signal measured in neigh-boring neurons. Further, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal from individual venules and the cerebral-blood-volume signal from individual arterioles show correlations at ultra-slow (< 0.1 Hz), anesthetic-modulated rhythms. These data support a model that links neuronal activity to intrinsic oscillations in the cerebral vasculature, with a spatial correlation length of similar to 2 mm for arterioles. In complementary data from awake human subjects, the BOLD signal is spatially correlated among sulcus veins and specified intracortical veins of the visual cortex at similar ultra-slow rhythms. These data support the use of fMRI to resolve functional connectivity at the level of single vessels.

In addition, temporal filtering, one of the crucial steps in preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images, induces its own autocorrelation. While performing connectivity analysis in fMRI, the impact of the autocorrelation is largely ignored. Recently, autocorrelation has been addressed by variance correction approaches, which are sensitive to the sampling rate. In this article, we aim to investigate the impact of the sampling rate on the variance correction approaches. Toward this end, we first derived a generalized expression for the variance of the sample Pearson correlation coefficient (SPCC) in terms of the sampling rate and the filter cutoff frequency, in addition to the autocorrelation and cross-covariance functions of the time series. Through simulations, we illustrated the importance of the variance correction for a fixed sampling rate. Using the real resting state fMRI data sets, we demonstrated that the data sets with higher sampling rates were more prone to false positives, in agreement with the existing empirical reports. We further demonstrated with single subject results that for the data sets with higher sampling rates, the variance correction strategy restored the integrity of true connectivity.

Modular preprocessing pipelines can reintroduce artifacts into fMRI data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						preprocessing; resting-state; fMRI; artifacts; motion	RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; MOTION ARTIFACT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; NOISE; BOLD; FLUCTUATIONS; REGRESSION; SIGNAL	The preprocessing pipelines typically used in both task and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) analysis are modular in nature: They are composed of a number of separate filtering/regression steps, including removal of head motion covariates and band-pass filtering, performed sequentially and in a flexible order. In this article, we illustrate the shortcomings of this approach, as we show how later preprocessing steps can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the data in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each regression step is a geometric projection of data onto a subspace, and that performing a sequence of projections can move the data into subspaces no longer orthogonal to those previously removed, reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates. Thus, linear filtering operations are not commutative, and the order in which the preprocessing steps are performed is critical. These issues can arise in practice when any combination of standard preprocessing steps including motion regression, scrubbing, component-based correction, physiological correction, global signal regression, and temporal filtering are performed sequentially. In this work, we focus primarily on rs-fMRI. We illustrate the problem both theoretically and empirically through application to a test-retest rs-fMRI data set, and suggest remedies. These include (a) combining all steps into a single linear filter, or (b) sequential orthogonalization of covariates/linear filters performed in series.

The main problem lies in the identification of brain regions that contribute to differentiating between a healthy subject and a schizophrenia affected subject. The problem becomes complex due to the high dimensionality of the fMRI data on the one hand and the availability of data for only a small number of subjects on the other hand. In this paper, we propose a three-stage evolutionary based framework for feature selection. It comprises application of general linear model, followed by statistical hypothesis testing, and finally application of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to arrive at a small set of about fifty features. Experiments show that the feature set generated by the proposed approach yields accuracy as high as 99.5% in classifying fMRI dataset of healthy and schizophrenia subjects, and can identify the relevant brain regions that are affected in schizophrenia.

While practically important, this design issue is challenging. This mainly is because that the information matrix cannot be fully determined at the design stage, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the selected designs. To tackle this challenging issue, we propose an easy-to-use optimality criterion for evaluating the quality of designs, and an efficient approach for obtaining designs optimizing this criterion. Compared with a previously proposed method, our approach requires a much less computing time to achieve designs with high statistical efficiencies.

The efficacy of rehabilitation in promoting functional recovery and increasing quality of life in MS patients has been demonstrated. Patient concerns: A 47-year-old woman was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in November 2014 because of left upper limb hypoesthesia and weakness with difficulty in hand manipulation skills (there was a 1-point Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression, i.e., 2.5 vs 1.5). Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a new frontal right cortical high-signal-intensity lesion. Diagnosis: Neurological and MRI examination were suggestive of MS diagnosis. Interventions: Patient was treated with robotic rehabilitation and evaluated by a Glove Analyzer for fMRI system (GAF). Functional MRI (fMRI) was acquired before and at the end of rehabilitative treatment performed with robotic device (Armeo-power). Outcomes: At the end of the rehabilitation program, most of the behavioral parameters, GAF and fMRI evaluation, showed a significative improvement. Moreover, fMRI showed a significantly increased functional activation within the sensory-motor network in the active, motor task. Lessons: Our findings suggest a possible restorative effect of robotics on brain networks. Moreover, we may argue that GAF may be a valuable tool in assessing functional recovery after upper limb rehabilitation, especially of associated to fMRI examination.

Seed placement especially impacts on RS-fMRI studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), because individuals with ASD are known to possess more variable network topographies. Here, we present a novel pipeline for analysing RS-fMRI in ASD using the cingulate cortex as an exemplar anatomical region of interest. Rather than using seeds based on previous literature, or gross morphology, we used a combination of structural information, task-independent (RS-fMRI) and task-dependent functional connectivity (Meta-Analytic Connectivity Modeling) to partition the cingulate cortex into six subregions with unique connectivity fingerprints and diverse behavioural profiles. This parcellation was consistent between groups and highly replicable across individuals (up to 93% detection) suggesting that the organisation of cortico-cingulo connections is highly similar between groups. However, our results showed an age-related increase in connectivity between the anterior middle cingulate cortex and right lateral prefrontal cortex in ASD, whilst this connectivity decreased in controls. There was also a Group x Grey Matter (GM) interaction, showing increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the rectal gyrus in concert with increasing rectal gyrus GM in controls. By comparing our approach to previously established methods we revealed that our approach improves network detection in both groups, and that the ability to detect group differences using 4 mm radius spheres varies greatly with seed placement. Using our multi-modal approach we find disrupted cortico-cingulo circuits that, based on task-dependent information, may contribute to ASD deficits in attention and social interaction. Moreover, we highlight how more sensitive approaches to RS-fMRI are crucial for establishing robust and reproducible connectivity-based biomarkers in psychiatric disorders. (c) 2016 The Authors.

However, it is difficult to measure directly both the astrocytic activity and fMRI to relate the various forms of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signaling to brain states under normal and pathological conditions. In this study, fMRI and GCaMP-mediated Ca2+ optical fiber recordings revealed distinct evoked astrocytic Ca2+ signals that were coupled with positive BOLD signals and intrinsic astrocytic Ca2+ signals that were coupled with negative BOLD signals. Both evoked and intrinsic astrocytic calcium signal could occur concurrently or respectively during stimulation. The intrinsic astrocytic calcium signal can be detected globally in multiple cortical sites in contrast to the evoked astrocytic calcium signal only detected at the activated cortical region. Unlike propagating Ca2+ waves in spreading depolarization/depression, the intrinsic Ca2+ spikes occurred simultaneously in both hemispheres and were initiated upon the activation of the central thalamus and midbrain reticular formation. The occurrence of the intrinsic astrocytic calcium signal is strongly coincident with an increased EEG power level of the brain resting-state fluctuation. These results demonstrate highly correlated astrocytic Ca2+ spikes with bidirectional fMRI signals based on the thalamic regulation of cortical states, depicting a brain-state dependency of both astrocytic Ca2+ and BOLD fMRI signals.

In this study, we aimed to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a non-invasive mapping method, to establish a panel of tasks investigating patients' language function. We developed six tasks, including a series of progressive comprehension tasks from words, sentence to text, a verb generation task that can detect subtle left-brain activation, an auditory comprehension task that explored the temporal language-related areas, and a visual object-naming task provided for poorly educated patients. We successfully located the language cortex in 40 patients, and subsequently determined hemispheric dominance for the Chinese language. Our results showed a concordance between fMRI tasks and electrical cortical stimulation. The consistency across tasks revealed by the laterality index, as well as the concordance between the surgical outcomes and the results of localization, suggested the validity of our fMRI tasks. Our fMRI tasks also corroborate and extend the finding that the left middle frontal area (BA 9) plays an important role in reading Chinese.

Effective rehabilitation is hindered by uncertainty surrounding the underlying mechanisms that govern long-term ischaemic injury progression. Despite its potential as a sensitive non-invasive in vivo marker of brain function that may aid in the development of new treatments, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has found limited application in the clinical research on chronic stage stroke progression. Stroke affects each of the physiological parameters underlying the BOLD contrast, markedly complicating the interpretation of BOLD fMRI data. This review summarizes current progress on application of BOLD fMRI in the chronic stage of ischaemic injury progression and discusses means by which more information may be gained from such BOLD fMRI measurements. Concomitant measurements of vascular reactivity, neuronal activity and metabolism in preclinical models of stroke are reviewed along with illustrative examples of post-ischaemic evolution in neuronal, glial and vascular function. The realization of the BOLD fMRI potential to propel stroke research is predicated on the carefully designed preclinical research establishing an ischaemia-specific quantitative model of BOLD signal contrast to provide the framework for interpretation of fMRI findings in clinical populations. This article is part of the themed issue 'Interpreting BOLD: a dialogue between cognitive and cellular neuroscience'.	[Lake, Evelyn M.

J	Power, JD				Power, Jonathan D.			A simple but useful way to assess fMRI scan qualities	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article								This short "how to" article describes a plot I find useful for assessing fMRI data quality. I discuss the reasoning behind the plot and how it is constructed. I create the plot in scans from several publicly available datasets to illustrate different kinds of fMRI signal variance, ranging from thermal noise to motion artifacts to respiratory related signals. I also show how the plot can be used to understand the variance removed during denoising. Code to make the plot is provided with the article, and supplemental movies show plots for hundreds of additional subjects.

All participants have mild intellectual disability classified by the standard IQ measures (mean = 61.2, ranges from 55 to 68). Both the Test of Visual Perceptual Skill- Third Edition (TVPS-3) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to evaluate the training outcomes. Results of TVPS-3 and fMRI showed that DS group had visual perceptual deficits and abnormal neural networks related to visual organization. The results showed that DS intervention group had significant improvements on TVPS-3 after intervention. The fMRI results indicated more activation in superior and inferior parietal lobes (spatial manipulation), as well as precentral gyros and dorsal premotor cortex (motor imagery) in DS intervention group. The CVPT program was effective in improving visual perceptual functions and enhancing associated cortical activations in DS.

J	Patel, AX; Bullmore, ET				Patel, Ameera X.; Bullmore, Edward T.			A wavelet-based estimator of the degrees of freedom in denoised fMRI time series for probabilistic testing of functional connectivity and brain graphs	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Connectivity; Graph theory; Wavelet despike; Despiking; Statistic; Probabilistic; Inference; Degrees of freedom	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MR IMAGE-ANALYSIS; RESAMPLING METHODS; NEUROIMAGING DATA; MOTION; NETWORKS; INFERENCE	Connectome mapping using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a focus of systems neuroscience. There remain many statistical challenges in analysis of functional connectivity and network architecture from BOLD fMRI multivariate time series. One key statistic for any time series is its (effective) degrees of freedom, df, which will generally be less than the number of time points (or nominal degrees of freedom, N). If we know the df, then probabilistic inference on other fMRI statistics, such as the correlation between two voxel or regional time series, is feasible. However, we currently lack good estimators of df in fMRI time series, especially after the degrees of freedom of the "raw" data have been modified substantially by denoising algorithms for head movement. Here, we used a wavelet-based method both to denoise fMRI data and to estimate the (effective) df of the denoised process. We show that seed voxel correlations corrected for locally variable df could be tested for false positive connectivity with better control over Type I error and greater specificity of anatomical mapping than probabilistic connectivity maps using the nominal degrees of freedom. We also show that wavelet despiked statistics can be used to estimate all pairwise correlations between a set of regional nodes, assign a P value to each edge, and then iteratively add edges to the graph in order of increasing P. These probabilistically thresholded graphs are likely more robust to regional variation in head movement effects than comparable graphs constructed by thresholding correlations. Finally, we show that time-windowed estimates of df can be used for probabilistic connectivity testing or dynamic network analysis so that apparent changes in the functional connectome are appropriately corrected for the effects of transient noise bursts. Wavelet despiking is both an algorithm for fMRI time series denoising and an estimator of the (effective) df of denoised fMRI time series. Accurate estimation of df offers many potential advantages for probabilistically thresholding functional connectivity and network statistics tested in the context of spatially variant and non-stationary noise.

Vascular and metabolic integrity are believed to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus, the use of calibrated fMRI in AD may help understand the disease and monitor therapeutic responses in future clinical trials. In the present work, we applied a calibrated fMRI approach referred to as Quantitative O2 (QUO2) in a cohort of probable AD dementia and age-matched control participants. The resulting CBF, OEF and CMRO2 values fell within the range from previous studies using positron emission tomography (PET) with O-15 labeling. Moreover, the typical parietotemporal pattern of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism in AD was observed, especially in the precuneus, a particularly vulnerable region. We detected no deficit in frontal CBF, nor in whole grey matter CVR, which supports the hypothesis that the effects observed were associated specifically with AD rather than generalized vascular disease. Some key pitfalls affecting both ASL and BOLD methods were encountered, such as prolonged arterial transit times (particularly in the occipital lobe), the presence of susceptibility artifacts obscuring medial temporal regions, and the challenges associated with the hypercapnic manipulation in AD patients and elderly participants. The present results are encouraging and demonstrate the promise of calibrated fMRI measurements as potential biomarkers in AD. Although CMRO2 can be imaged with O-15 PET, the QUO2 method uses more widely available imaging infrastructure, avoids exposure to ionizing radiation, and integrates with other MRIbased measures of brain structure and function.

Methods: A randomly undersampled variable density spiral trajectory enabling an acceleration factor of 5.3 was designed with a balanced steady state free precession sequence to achieve high spatial resolution data acquisition. A modified k-t SPARSE method was then implemented and applied with a strategy to optimize regularization parameters for consistent, high quality CS reconstruction. Results: The proposed method improves spatial resolution by sixfold with 12 to 47% contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), 33 to 117% F-value improvement and maintains the same temporal resolution. It also achieves high sensitivity of 69 to 99% compared the original ground-truth, small false positive rate of less than 0.05 and low hemodynamic response function distortion across a wide range of CNRs. The proposed method is robust to physiological noise and enables detection of layer-specific activities in vivo, which cannot be resolved using the highest spatial resolution Nyquist acquisition. Conclusion: The proposed method enables high spatial resolution fMRI that can resolve layer-specific brain activity and demonstrates the significant improvement that CS can bring to high spatial resolution fMRI.

J	Hald, DH; Henao, R; Winther, O				Hald, Ditte Hovenhoff; Henao, Ricardo; Winther, Ole			Gaussian process based independent analysis for temporal source separation in fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Gaussian processes; FMRI; Source separation; Independent component analysis; Convolutive mixing; Bayesian inference	MODELS	Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) gives us a unique insight into the processes of the brain, and opens up for analyzing the functional activation patterns of the underlying sources. Task-inferred supervised learning with restrictive assumptions in the regression set-up, restricts the exploratory nature of the analysis. Fully unsupervised independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms, on the other hand, can struggle to detect clear classifiable components on single-subject data. We attribute this shortcoming to inadequate modeling of the fMRI source signals by failing to incorporate its temporal nature. fMRI source signals, biological stimuli and non-stimuli-related artifacts are all smooth over a time-scale compatible with the sampling time (TR). We therefore propose Gaussian process ICA (GPICA), which facilitates temporal dependency by the use of Gaussian process source priors. On two fMRI data sets with different sampling frequency, we show that the GPICA-inferred temporal components and associated spatial maps allow for a more definite interpretation than standard temporal ICA methods. The temporal structures of the sources are controlled by the covariance of the Gaussian process, specified by a kernel function with an interpretable and controllable temporal length scale parameter. We propose a hierarchical model specification, considering both instantaneous and convolutive mixing, and we infer source spatial maps, temporal patterns and temporal length scale parameters by Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

In the context of a gustatory stimulation paradigm, fMRI can provide crucial information about the sensory, cognitive, and hedonic integration of exteroceptive stimuli in healthy and pathological nutritional conditions. Our aims were (i) to validate the experimental setup, i.e., fMRI acquisition and SPM-based statistical analysis, with a visual stimulation; (ii) to implement the fMRI procedure in order to map the brain responses to different gustatory stimulations, i.e., sucrose (5%) and quinine (10 mM), and (ii) to investigate the differential effects of potentially aversive (quinine) and appetitive/ pleasant (sucrose) oral stimulation on brain responses, especially in the limbic and reward circuits. Six Yucatan minipigs were imaged on an Avanto 1.5-T MRI under isoflurane anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. BOLD signal was recorded during visual or gustatory (artificial saliva, sucrose, or quinine) stimulation with a block paradigm. With the visual stimulation, brain responses were detected in the visual cortex, thus validating our experimental and statistical setup. Quinine and sucrose stimulation promoted different cerebral activation patterns that were concordant, to some extent, to results from human studies. The insular cortex (i.e., gustatory cortex) was activated with both sucrose and quinine, but other regions were specifically activated by one or the other stimulation. Gustatory stimulation combined with fMRI analysis in large animals such as minipigs is a promising approach to investigate the integration of gustatory stimulation in healthy or pathological conditions such as obesity, eating disorders, or dysgeusia. To date, this is the first intent to describe gustatory stimulation in minipigs using fMRI.

J	Aghdam, MA; Sharifi, A; Pedram, MM				Aghdam, Maryam Akhavan; Sharifi, Arash; Pedram, Mir Mohsen			Combination of rs-fMRI and sMRI Data to Discriminate Autism Spectrum Disorders in Young Children Using Deep Belief Network	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; rs-fMRI; sMRI; Gray matter; White matter; Deep belief network	CLASSIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ADHD	In recent years, the use of advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has recorded a great increase in neuropsychiatric disorders. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is increasingly being used for applications of medical image analysis such as computer-aided diagnosis. In a bid to classify and represent learning tasks, this study utilized one of the most powerful deep learning algorithms (deep belief network (DBN)) for the combination of data from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I and II (ABIDE I and ABIDE II) datasets. The DBN was employed so as to focus on the combination of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) data. This was done based on the brain regions that were defined using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL), in order to classify autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) from typical controls (TCs). Since the diagnosis of ASD is much more effective at an early age, only 185 individuals (116 ASD and 69 TC) ranging in age from 5 to 10years were included in this analysis. In contrast, the proposed method is used to exploit the latent or abstract high-level features inside rs-fMRI and sMRI data while the old methods consider only the simple low-level features extracted from neuroimages. Moreover, combining multiple data types and increasing the depth of DBN can improve classification accuracy. In this study, the best combination comprised rs-fMRI, GM, and WM for DBN of depth 3 with 65.56% accuracy (sensitivity=84%, specificity=32.96%, F1 score=74.76%) obtained via 10-fold cross-validation. This result outperforms previously presented methods on ABIDE I dataset.

J	Sutterer, MJ; Tranel, D				Sutterer, Matthew J.; Tranel, Daniel			Neuropsychology and Cognitive Neuroscience in the fMRI Era: A Recapitulation of Localizationist and Connectionist Views	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						neuropsychology; lesion; fMRI; connectivity	HUMAN BRAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DISCONNECTION SYNDROMES; NETWORK LOCALIZATION; WORKING-MEMORY; LESION; DAMAGE	Objective: We highlight the past 25 years of cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, focusing on the impact to the field of the introduction in 1992 of functional MRI (fMRI). Method: We reviewed the past 25 years of literature in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, focusing on the relation and interplay of fMRI studies and studies utilizing the "lesion method" in human participants with focal brain damage. Results: Our review highlights the state of localist/connectionist research debates in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology circa 1992, and details how the introduction of fMRI into the field at that time catalyzed a new wave of efforts to map complex human behavior to specific brain regions. This, in turn, eventually evolved into many studies that focused on networks and connections between brain areas, culminating in recent years with large-scale investigations such as the Human Connectome Project. Conclusions: We argue that throughout the past 25 years, neuropsychology-and more precisely, the "lesion method" in humans-has continued to play a critical role in arbitrating conclusions and theories derived from inferred patterns of local brain activity or wide-spread connectivity from functional imaging approaches. We conclude by highlighting the future for neuropsychology in the context of an increasingly complex methodological armamentarium. General Scientific Summary This review covers the last 25 years of research in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology. The introduction of functional MRI (fMRI) in 1992 generated a number of studies that echo historical debates on the importance of localizing behavior to specific brain areas, compared with focusing on the importance of connections between brain areas. Neuropsychology has played a critical role in arbitrating theories derived from fMRI, and we predict it will continue to do so in the future.

New method: Graph theory and machine learning approach were utilized to predict progress of patients with MCI to AD using rs-fMRI. Eighteen MCI converts (average age 73.6 years; 11 male) and 62 age matched MCI non-converters (average age 73.0 years, 28 male) were included in this study. We trained and tested a support vector machine (SVM) to classify MCI-C from MCI-NC using features constructed based on the local and global graph measures. A novel feature selection algorithm was developed and utilized to select an optimal subset of features. Results: Using subset of optimal features in SVM, we classified MCI-C from MCI-NC with an, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating, characteristic (ROC) curve of 91.4%, 83.24%, 90.1%, and 0.95, respectively. Furthermore, results of our statistical analyses were used to identify the affected brain regions in AD. Comparison with existing method(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines the graph measures (constructed based on rs-fMRI) with machine learning approach and accurately classify MCI-C from MCI-NC. Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrate potential of the proposed approach for early AD diagnosis and demonstrate capability of rs-fMRI to predict conversion from MCI to AD by identifying affected brain regions underlying this conversion.

This article first proposes a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify resting-state fMRI periods that precede hallucinations versus periods that do not. When applied to whole-brain fMRI data, state-of-the-art classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), yield dense solutions that are difficult to interpret. We proposed to extend the existing sparse classification methods by taking the spatial structure of brain images into account with structured sparsity using the total variation penalty. Based on this approach, we obtained reliable classifying performances associated with interpretable predictive patterns, composed of two clearly identifiable clusters in speech-related brain regions. The variation in transition-to-hallucination functional patterns not only from one patient to another but also from one occurrence to the next (e.g., also depending on the sensory modalities involved) appeared to be the major difficulty when developing effective classifiers. Consequently, second, this article aimed to characterize the variability within the prehallucination patterns using an extension of principal component analysis with spatial constraints. The principal components (PCs) and the associated basis patterns shed light on the intrinsic structures of the variability present in the dataset. Such results are promising in the scope of innovative fMRI-guided therapy for drug-resistant hallucinations, such as fMRI-based neurofeedback.

Repeatability of language fMRI lateralization and localization metrics in brain tumor patients	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						language fMRI; lateralization; presurgical mapping; repeatability; reproducibility	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CLINICAL FMRI; INTRASUBJECT REPRODUCIBILITY; DOMINANCE; TASK; ACTIVATION; PARADIGMS; EPILEPSY; VARIABILITY	To assess the within-subject intra-scan session repeatability of language functional MRI (fMRI) activation maps in patients with brain tumors who were undergoing presurgical fMRI as part of their preoperative clinical workup. Sentence completion (SC) and silent word generation (SWG) tasks were used for language localization and hemispheric lateralization for identifying the primary language cortex. Within-subject repeatability for each of these paradigms was assessed in right-handed patients-37 for SC and 78 for SWG. Repeatability of activation maps between consecutive runs of the same task within the same scan session was evaluated by comparing lateralization indexes in holohemispheric and regional language areas. Displacement of center of activation between consecutive runs was also used to assess the repeatability of activation maps. Holohemispheric and regional language lateralization results demonstrated high intra-subject intra-scan repeatability when lateralization indices were calculated using threshold-dependent and threshold-independent approaches. The high repeatability is demonstrated both when centers of mass of activation are considered within key eloquent regions of the brain, such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area, as well as in larger more inclusive expressive and receptive language regions. We examined two well-known and widely accepted language tasks that are known to activate eloquent language cortex. We have demonstrated very high degree of repeatability at a single-subject level within single scan sessions of language mapping in a large cohort of brain tumor patients undergoing presurgical fMRI across several years at our institution.

An Exploratory Randomized, Single-Blinded Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REAL-TIME FMRI; MULTISOURCE INTERFERENCE TASK; RESONANCE-IMAGING FMRI; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CLINICAL-TRIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; ADHD; METAANALYSIS	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by poor cognitive control/ attention and hypofunctioning of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). In the current study, we investigated for the first time whether real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI) training targeted at increasing activation levels within dACC in adults with ADHD leads to a reduction of clinical symptoms and improved cognitive functioning. An exploratory randomized controlled treatment study with blinding of the participants was conducted. Participants with ADHD (n = 7 in the neurofeedback group, and n = 6 in the control group) attended four weekly MRI training sessions (60-min training time/session), during which they performed a mental calculation task at varying levels of difficulty, in order to learn how to up-regulate dACC activation. Only neurofeedback participants received continuous feedback information on actual brain activation levels within dACC. Before and after the training, ADHD symptoms and relevant cognitive functioning was assessed. Results showed that both groups achieved a significant increase in dACC activation levels over sessions. While there was no significant difference between the neurofeedback and control group in clinical outcome, neurofeedback participants showed stronger improvement on cognitive functioning. The current study demonstrates the general feasibility of the suggested rt-fMRI neurofeedback training approach as a potential novel treatment option for ADHD patients. Due to the study's small sample size, potential clinical benefits need to be further investigated in future studies.

This noninvasive modality is a promising imaging biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where the connectome can be an indicator to assess and to understand the pathology. However, it only provides noisy measurements of brain activity. As a consequence, it has shown fairly limited discrimination power on clinical groups. So far, the reference functional marker of AD is the fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). It gives a reliable quantification of metabolic activity, but it is costly and invasive. Here, our goal is to analyze AD populations solely based on rs-fMRI, as functional connectivity is correlated to metabolism. We introduce transmodal learning: leveraging a prior from one modality to improve results of another modality on different subjects. A metabolic prior is learned from an independent FDG-PET dataset to improve functional connectivity-based prediction of AD. The prior acts as a regularization of connectivity learning and improves the estimation of discriminative patterns from distinct rs-fMRI datasets. Our approach is a two-stage classification strategy that combines several seed-based connectivity maps to cover a large number of functional networks that identify AD physiopathology. Experimental results show that our transmodal approach increases classification accuracy compared to pure rs-fMRI approaches, without resorting to additional invasive acquisitions. The method successfully recovers brain regions known to be impacted by the disease.

Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated brain function in narcolepsy during rest using positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In addition to hypothalamic and thalamic dysfunction they showed aberrant prefrontal perfusion and glucose metabolism in narcolepsy. Given these findings in brain structure and metabolism in narcolepsy, we anticipated that changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state network (RSN) dynamics might also be apparent in patients with narcolepsy. The objective of this study was to investigate and describe brain microstate activity in adolescents with narcolepsy and correlate these to RSNs using simultaneous fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG). Sixteen adolescents (ages 13-20) with a confirmed diagnosis of narcolepsy were recruited and compared to age-matched healthy controls. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI data were collected during 10 min of wakeful rest. EEG data were analyzed for microstates, which are discrete epochs of stable global brain states obtained from topographical EEG analysis. Functional fMRI data were analyzed for RSNs. Data showed that narcolepsy patients were less likely than controls to spend time in a microstate which we found to be related to the default mode network and may suggest a disruption of this network that is disease specific. We concluded that adolescents with narcolepsy have altered resting state brain dynamics.

Evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) suggests that oscillations in the alpha and beta bands may support processes at different stages of GSI. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between electrophysiological oscillations and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during GSI. In a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, German participants (n=19) were presented with videos of an actor either performing meaningful gestures in the context of a comprehensible German (GG) or incomprehensible Russian sentence (GR), or just speaking a German sentence (SG). EEG results revealed reduced alpha and beta power for the GG vs. SG conditions, while fMRI analyses showed BOLD increase in the left pSTS/MTG for GG>GRGG>SG. In time-window-based EEG-informed fMRI analyses, we further found a positive correlation between single-trial alpha power and BOLD signal in the left pSTS/MTG, the left IFG, and several sub-cortical regions. Moreover, the alpha-pSTS/MTG correlation was observed in an earlier time window in comparison to the alpha-IFG correlation, thus supporting a two-stage processing model of GSI. Our study shows that EEG-informed fMRI implies multiple roles of alpha oscillations during GSI, and that the method is a best candidate for multidimensional investigations on complex cognitive functions such as GSI.

Auditory evoked BOLD responses in awake compared to lightly anaesthetized zebra finches	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL MRI; CONSPECIFIC SONG; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; ANESTHESIA; FOREBRAIN; CORTEX; RAT; DISCRIMINATION; SELECTIVITY	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience and has become a valuable tool in the study of auditory processing in zebra finches, a well-established model of learned vocal communication. Due to its sensitivity to head motion, most fMRI studies in animals are performed in anaesthetized conditions, which might significantly impact neural activity evoked by stimuli and cognitive tasks. In this study, we (1) demonstrate the feasibility of fMRI in awake zebra finches and (2) explore how light anaesthesia regimes affect auditory-evoked BOLD responses to biologically relevant songs. After an acclimation procedure, we show that fMRI can be successfully performed during wakefulness, enabling the detection of reproducible BOLD responses to sound. Additionally, two light anaesthesia protocols were tested (isoflurane and a combination of medetomidine and isoflurane), of which isoflurane alone appeared to be the most promising given the high success rate, non-invasive induction, and quick recovery. By comparing auditory evoked BOLD responses in awake versus lightly anaesthetized conditions, we observed overall effects of anaesthetics on cerebrovascular reactivity as reflected in the extent of positive and negative BOLD responses.

In fMRI experiment 1, a linear relationship between familiarity with lyrics and activation was found in left-hemispheric speech-related as well as bilateral striatal areas which is in line with previous research on generation of lyrics. In fMRI experiment 2, we employed so called Mondegreens and Soramimi to induce misperceptions of lyrics revealing a bilateral network including middle temporal and inferior frontal areas as well as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mediodorsal thalamus. ACC activation also correlated with the extent to which misperceptions were judged as amusing corroborating previous neuroimaging results on the role of this area in mediating the pleasant experience of chills during music perception. Finally, we examined the areas engaged during misperception of lyrics using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to determine their structural connectivity. These combined fMRI/DWI results could serve as a neurobiological model for future studies on other types of misunderstanding which are events with potentially strong impact on our social life.

J	Freches, GB; Chavarrias, C; Shemesh, N				Freches, Guilherme Blazquez; Chavarrias, Cristina; Shemesh, Noam			BOLD-fMRI in the mouse auditory pathway	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FREE PRECESSION FMRI; RAT VISUAL-SYSTEM; MN-ENHANCED MRI; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; HIGH-FIELD; BRAIN; MIDBRAIN; CORTEX; MICE; ORGANIZATION	The auditory pathway is widely distributed throughout the brain, and is perhaps one of the most interesting networks in the context of neuroplasticity. Accurate mapping of neural activity in the entire pathway, preferably noninvasively, and with high resolution, could be instrumental for understanding such longitudinal processes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has clear advantages for such characterizations, as it is noninvasive, provides relatively high spatial resolution and lends itself for repetitive studies, albeit relying on an indirect neurovascular coupling to deliver its information. Indeed, fMRI has been previously used to characterize the auditory pathway in humans and in rats. In the mouse, however, the auditory pathway has insofar only been mapped using manganese-enhanced MRI. Here, we describe a novel setup specifically designed for high-resolution mapping of the mouse auditory pathway using high-field fMRI. Robust and consistent Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) responses were documented along nearly the entire auditory pathway, from the cochlear nucleus (CN), through the superior olivary complex (SOC), nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LL), inferior colliculus (IC) and the medial geniculate body (MGB). By contrast, clear BOLD responses were not observed in auditory cortex (AC) in this study. Diverse BOLD latencies were mapped ROI- and pixel-wise using coherence analysis, evidencing different averaged BOLD time courses in different auditory centers. Some degree of tonotopy was identified in the IC, SOC, and MGB in the pooled dataset though it could not be assessed per subject due to a lack of statistical power. Given the importance of the mouse model in plasticity studies, animal models, and optogenetics, and fMRI's potential to map dynamic responses to specific cues, this first fMRI study of the mouse auditory pathway paves the way for future longitudinal studies studying brain-wide auditory-related activity in vivo.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study functional organization of the brain, but it remains unclear whether rs-fMRI could elucidate distinct characteristics in moyamoya disease. Here, we aimed to determine changes in a conventional rs-fMRI measure and analyze any associations with clinical symptoms and cerebral hemodynamics. Thirty-one adults with moyamoya disease and 25 adult controls underwent rs-fMRI, in which we measured brain connectivity via temporal correlations of low-frequency BOLD signals. We identified the extent of between-group differences with multivoxel pattern analysis. Seed-based analysis was performed to determine associations with vascular lesions, symptoms, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). There was significantly altered connectivity in the precentral gyrus, operculo-insular region, precuneus, cingulate cortex, and middle frontal gyrus in moyamoya disease. There was reduced connectivity in the left insula, left precuneus, right precentral, and right middle frontal regions, which form part of the salience, default mode, motor, and central executive networks, respectively. Patients with ischemic motor-related symptoms showed significantly decreased connectivity in precentral homotopic regions compared with those without, while there were no differences in vascular lesions or rCBF. Connectivity between the right occipital and left hippocampus was significantly associated with cognitive performance and posterior cerebral artery involvement. Our results demonstrate distinct alterations in the temporal correlations of low-frequency BOLD signals, predominantly in resting-state networks in moyamoya disease. Additionally, rs-fMRI measures were associated with ischemic motor-related symptoms and cognitive performance in the patients. Thus, rs-fMRI may offer a useful non-invasive method of acquiring additional information beyond cerebral perfusion as part of clinical investigations in patients with moyamoya disease.

Assignment Confidence in Localization of the Hand Motor Cortex: Comparison of Structural Imaging With Functional MRI	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY			English	Article						blood oxygenation level-dependent; central sulcus; cortical thickness; precentral knob; superior frontal sulcus	PRECENTRAL GYRUS; CENTRAL SULCUS; BRAIN-TUMORS; LANGUAGE; LOCATION; LANDMARK; GLIOMAS; AREAS	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assign confidence levels to structural MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) for localization of the primary motor cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Ninety-one fMRI studies with at least one motor task (178 hemispheres) were identified. Three anatomic assessments were used to localize the primary motor cortex: relation between the superior frontal sulcus and precentral sulcus; cortical thickness; and configuration of the precentral knob. In 105 hemispheres, interreader agreement was assessed for two investigators with different experience levels. Confidence ratings from 0 to 5 (0, no confidence; 5, 100% confidence) were assigned for fMRI and each anatomic localization method. RESULTS. Cortical thickness had the highest confidence rating (mean, 4.90 +/- 0.47 [SD]) with only one failure. The relation between the superior frontal sulcus and precentral sulcus had the lowest confidence rating (4.33 +/- 0.91) with three failures. The greatest statistical significance was observed for the cortical thickness and superior frontal sulcus-precentral sulcus methods (post hoc Bonferroni test, p < 0.001). Confidence rating scores were significantly higher for the cortical thickness sign than for fMRI results (4.72 +/- 0.54) for a single motor task (post hoc Bonferroni test, p = 0.006); however, the mean confidence rating for fMRI improved to 4.87 +/- 0.36 when additional motor tasks were performed. Interreader differences were least for the cortical thickness sign (paired t test, t = 4.25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. Cortical thickness is a better anatomic landmark than fMRI localization for assigning confidence regarding localization of the primary motor cortex; however, localization of motor function is more specific when combined with fMRI findings. Multiple techniques can be used to increase confidence in identifying the hand motor cortex.

Task difficulty modulates age-related differences in the behavioral and neural bases of language production	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Language production; Inhibitory control; Aging; Task difficulty; fMRI	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WORD-FINDING FAILURES; GO/NO-GO TASKS; OLDER-ADULTS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BLOOD-FLOW; SPEECH; FMRI; BRAIN	Older adults typically show decline in a variety of cognitive functions including inhibitory control and language production, with corresponding age-related increases in fMRI activation. However, it remains unclear whether such increases are compensatory or whether they reflect neural decline. One factor that may influence these brain-behavior relationships is difficulty. The current study investigated the effect of difficulty on age-related differences in the behavioral and neural bases of language production and inhibitory control using a phonological Go/No-Go picture naming task. Task demands were manipulated by varying the proportion of naming trials (Go trials) and inhibition trials (No-Go trials) across runs. All participants showed task-difficulty related declines in behavioral performance and increases in fMRI activation. Behaviorally, older adults were more sensitive to task difficulty, and elicited more fMRI activation than younger adults. Older adults were less neurally responsive to additional task demands (i.e., picture naming alone vs. Go/No-Go picture naming), but interestingly showed similar within-task increases as younger adults (e.g., Go Bias vs. No-Go Bias). Moreover, the relationships between fMRI activation and behavioral performance in older adults were multifaceted and the strength of these relations changed as a function of task difficulty. Specifically, activation in pre- and post- central gyri, right supramarginal and angular gyri was negatively correlated with naming reaction times, suggesting that activation in these regions may help mitigate age-related declines in language production. These findings are partially consistent with the CRUNCH model, highlighting the important influence of task difficulty on older adults' behavioral performance and their patterns of fMRI activation during language production.

A direct comparison between ERP and fMRI measurements of food-related inhibitory control: Implications for BMI status and dietary intake	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						N2 ERP; P3 ERP; fMRI; Food-related inhibitory control; BMI; ASA24	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DIFFEOMORPHIC IMAGE REGISTRATION; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN RESPONSES; SAMPLE-SIZE CALCULATIONS; HIGH-CALORIE FOODS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NORMAL-WEIGHT; OBESE WOMEN	Obesity and maintaining a healthy diet have important implications for physical and mental health. One factor that may influence diet and obesity is inhibitory control. We tested how N2 and P3 amplitude, event-related potential (ERP) components that reflect inhibitory control, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in brain regions associated with inhibitory control differed toward high-and low-calorie food stimuli across BMI status. We also assessed the relationship between neural indices of food-related inhibitory control and laboratory and daily food intake. Fifty-four individuals (17 normal-weight; 18 overweight; 19 individuals with obesity) completed two food-based go/no-go tasks (one with high-and one with low-calorie foods as no-go stimuli), once during ERP data acquisition and once during fMRI data acquisition. After testing, participants were presented with an ad libitum weighed food buffet. Participants also recorded their food intake using the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Recall (ASA24) system across four days. Individuals recruited more inhibitory control when withholding responses towards high-compared to low-calorie foods, although this effect was more consistent for N2 than P3 or fMRI assessments. BMI status did not influence food-related inhibitory control. A larger inhibitory response as measured by N2 amplitude was related to increased ASA24 food intake; P3 amplitude and fMRI region of interest activity did not predict ASA24 intake; neither method predicted food intake from the buffet. ERP and fMRI measurements show similar neural responses to food, although N2 amplitude may be somewhat more sensitive in detecting differences between food types and predicting self-reports of food intake.

BOLD fMRI in awake prairie voles: A platform for translational social and affective neuroscience	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Prairie voles; Awake fMRI; Novel odor	SPIN-ECHO FMRI; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; COCAINE; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; AMYGDALA; SYSTEM; NORMS	The advancement of neuroscience depends on continued improvement inmethods andmodels. Here, we present novel techniques for the use of awake functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) - an important step forward in minimally-invasive measurement of neural activity in a nontraditional animal model. Imaging neural responses in prairie voles, a species studied for its propensity to form strong and selective social bonds, is expected to greatly advance ourmechanistic understanding of complex social and affective processes. The use of ultra-high-field fMRI allows for recording changes in region- specific activity throughout the entire brain simultaneously and with high temporal and spatial resolutions. By imaging neural responses in awake animals, with minimal invasiveness, we are able to avoid the confound of anesthesia, broaden the scope of possible stimuli, and potentially make use of repeated scans from the same animals. These methods are made possible by the development of an annotated and segmented 3D vole brain atlas and software for image analysis. The use of these methods in the prairie vole provides an opportunity to broaden neuroscientific investigation of behavior via a comparative approach, which highlights the ethological relevance of pro-social behaviors shared between voles and humans, such as communal breeding, selective social bonds, social buffering of stress, and caregiving behaviors. Results using these methods show that fMRI in the prairie vole is capable of yielding robust blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in response to hypercapnic challenge (inhaled 5% CO2), region-specific physical challenge (unilateral whisker stimulation), and presentation of a set of novel odors. Complementary analyses of repeated restraint sessions in the imaging hardware suggest that voles do not require acclimation to this procedure. Taken together, awake vole fMRI represents a new arena of neurobiological study outside the realm of traditional rodent models. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Yee, J.

The olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli, spherical neuropil regions with well-defined neuronal circuitry, can provide insights into this issue. Optical calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye imaging (OICa2+) reflects dynamics of pre-synaptic input to glomeruli, whereas high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using deoxyhemoglobin contrast reveals neuropil function within the glomerular layer where both pre- and post-synaptic activities contribute. We imaged odor-specific activity patterns of the dorsal OB in the same anesthetized rats with fMRI and OICa2+ and then co-registered the respective maps to compare patterns in the same space. Maps by each modality were very reproducible as trial-to-trial patterns for a given odor, overlapping by similar to 80%. Maps evoked by ethyl butyrate and methyl valerate for a given modality overlapped by similar to 80%, suggesting activation of similar dorsal glomerular networks by these odors. Comparison of maps generated by both methods for a given odor showed similar to 70% overlap, indicating similar odor-specific maps by each method. These results suggest that odor-specific glomerular patterns by high-resolution fMRI primarily tracks pre-synaptic input to the OB. Thus combining OICa2+ and fMRI lays the framework for studies of OB processing over a range of spatiotemporal scales, where OICa2+ can feature the fast dynamics of dorsal glomerular clusters and fMRI can map the entire glomerular sheet in the OB.

Here, we address this question by using real-time MR imaging (rtMRI) of the vocal tract and functional MRI (fMRI) of the brain in a speech imitation paradigm. Participants trained on imitating a native vowel and a similar nonnative vowel that required lip rounding. Later, participants imitated these vowels and an untrained vowel pair during separate fMRI and rtMRI runs. Univariate fMRI analyses revealed that regions including left inferior frontal gyrus were more active during sensorimotor transformation (ST) and production of nonnative vowels, compared with native vowels; further, ST for nonnative vowels activated somatomotor cortex bilaterally, compared with ST of native vowels. Using test representational similarity analysis (RSA) models constructed from participants' vocal tract images and from stimulus formant distances, we found that RSA searchlight analyses of fMRI data showed either type of model could be represented in somatomotor, temporal, cerebellar, and hippocampal neural activation patterns during ST. We thus provide the first evidence of widespread and robust cortical and subcortical neural representation of vocal tract and/or formant parameters, during prearticulatory ST.

Although promising therapeutic interventions for neurogenic dysphagia are being developed, the functional neuroanatomy of recovered swallowing in this population remains uncertain. Here, we investigated 18 patients post-stroke who recovered from dysphagia using an event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of swallowing. Patients were characterized by initial dysphagia score (mild to severe), lesion mapping, white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) of the pyramidal tracts, and swallowing performance measurement during fMRI scanning. Eighteen age matched healthy participants served as a control group. Overall, patients showed decreased fMRI-activation in the entire swallowing network apart from an increase of activation in the contralesional primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Moreover, fMRI activation in contralesional S1 correlated with initial dysphagia score. Finally, when lesions of the pyramidal tract were more severe, recovered swallowing appeared to be associated with asymmetric activation of the ipsilesional anterior cerebellum. Taken together, our data support a role for increased contralesional somatosensory resources and ipsilesional anterior cerebellum feed forward loops for recovered swallowing after dysphagia following stroke.

Our aim was to validate the functional relevance of RS-fMRI by investigating the association between RS-fMRI and pre-operative motor and language function performance in patients with brain tumor. Materials and methods. - Sixty-nine patients with brain tumors were prospectively recruited. Patients with tumors near precentral gyrus (n = 49) underwent assessment for apparent (paresis) and subtle (finger tapping) deficits. Patients with left frontal tumors in the vicinity of the inferior frontal gyrus (n = 29) underwent assessment for gross (aphasia) and mild language (phonological verbal fluency) deficits. RS-fMRI results were extracted by spatial independent component analysis (ICA). Results. - Motor group: paretic patients showed significantly (P = 0.01) decreased BOLD signal in ipsilesional precentral gyrus when compared to contralesional one. Significantly (P < 0.01) lower BOLD signal was also observed in ipsilesional precentral gyrus of paretics when compared with the non-paretics. In asymptomatic patients, a strong positive correlation (r = 0.68, P < 0.01) between ipsilesional motor cortex BOLD signal and contralesional finger tapping performance was observed. Language group: patients with aphasia showed significantly (P = 0.01) decreased RS-fMRI BOLD signal in left BA 44 when compared with non-aphasics. In asymptomatic patients, a strong positive correlation (r = 0.72, P < 0.01) between BA 44 BOLD signal and phonological fluency performance was observed.

Training emotion regulation through real-time fMRI neurofeedback of amygdala activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Reality check; Emotion regulation; Amygdala; fMRI; Prefrontal cortex	MEASURING MINDFULNESS; DOWN-REGULATION; GERMAN VERSION; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; VALIDATION; CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; FEEDBACK	Being in control of one's emotions is not only desirable in many everyday situations but is also a great challenge in a variety of mental disorders. Successful intentional emotion regulation is related to down-regulation of amygdala activity. Training mental interventions supported by neurofeedback of one's own amygdala activity using real-time (rt-) fMRI might be beneficial for mental health and well-being. Rt-fMRI guided amygdala-downregulation using cognitive interventions such as a "reality check", however, have not been well-investigated. Fifteen healthy subjects underwent four rt-fMRI sessions with neurofeedback of their own amygdala activity while applying a reality check as an emotion regulation strategy in order to down-regulate their amygdala signal during a stimulation with emotional pictures. The Control group comprised of eleven subjects also trained emotion regulation but without obtaining feedback. We hypothesized more prominent down-regulation of amygdala activity at the end of the training in the Feedback group. We investigated effects over time and between groups and further task specific connectivity of the amygdala by using psychophysiological interaction analyses. Four weekly amygdala-based feedback sessions resulted in significantly decreased amygdala activity (p = 0.003, d = 0.93), also compared to the Control group (p = 0.014, d = 1.12). Task specific connectivity of the amygdala with the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and distinct prefrontal areas was increased in the Feedback group. Training of emotion regulation supported by rt- fMRI neurofeedback resulted in a prominent amygdala downregulation compared to training without feedback. The finding implicates successful emotion regulation, compliant with emotion control models, through an easily applicable reality check strategy. Rt-fMRI neurofeedback may support emotion regulation learning and bears clinical potential for psychotherapy.

The literature reports algorithms to convert monopolar to bipolar settings. Purpose/Hypothesis To assess brain responses of Parkinson's disease patients implanted with DBS during fMRI studies using their clinical and presumed equivalent settings using a published conversion recipe. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Thirteen DBS patients. Field Strength/Sequence 1.5T and 3T, fMRI using gradient echo-planar imaging. Assessment Patients underwent 30/30sec ON/OFF DBS fMRI scans using monopolar and bipolar settings. To convert to a bipolar setting, the negative contact used for the monopolar configuration remained constant and the adjacent dorsal contact was rendered positive, while increasing the voltage by 30%. fMRI activation/deactivation maps and motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) scores were compared for patients in both configurations. Statistical Tests T-tests were used to compare UPDRS scores and volumes of tissue activated (VTA) diameters in monopolar and bipolar configurations. Results The patterns of fMRI activation in the monopolar and bipolar configurations were generally different. The thalamus, pallidum, and visual cortices exhibited higher activation using the patient's clinical settings than the presumed equivalent settings. VTA diameters were lower (7 mm vs. 6.3 mm, P = 0.047) and UPDRS scores were generally higher in the bipolar (33.2 +/- 16) than in the monopolar configuration (28.3 +/- 17.4), without reaching statistical significance (P > 0.05). Data Conclusion Monopolar and bipolar configurations result in different patterns of brain activation while using a previously published monopolar-bipolar conversion algorithm. Clinical benefits may be achieved with varying patterns of brain responses. Blind conversion from one to the other should be avoided for purposes of understanding the mechanisms of DBS.

It provides a means by which to see what the brain does while a person thinks, acts, or perceives, without invasive procedures. In this, fMRI affords us a relatively easy manner by which to peek under the hood of behavior and into the brain. Characterizing behavior with a neural correlate allows us to support or discard theoretical assumptions about the brain and behavior, to identify markers for individual and group differences. The increasing popularity of fMRI is facilitated by the apparent ease of data acquisition and analysis. This comes at a price: low signal-to-noise ratios, limitations in experimental design, and the difficulty in correctly applying and interpreting statistical tests are just a few of the pitfalls that have brought into question the reliability and validity of published fMRI data. Here, we aim to provide a general overview of the method, with an emphasis on fMRI and its analysis. Our goal is to provide the novice user with a comprehensive framework to get started on designing an imaging experiment in humans.

Eloquent functional areas should be delineated preoperatively, particularly for patients with tumors near eloquent areas. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive technique that demonstrates great promise for presurgical planning. However, specialized data processing toolkits for presurgical planning remain lacking. Based on several functions in open-source software such as Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST), Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) and Multiple Independent Component Analysis (MICA), here, we introduce an open-source MATLAB toolbox named PreSurgMapp. This toolbox can reveal eloquent areas using comprehensive methods and various complementary fMRI modalities. For example, PreSurgMapp supports both model-based (general linear model, GLM, and seed correlation) and data-driven (independent component analysis, ICA) methods and processes both task-based and resting-state fMRI data. PreSurgMapp is designed for highly automatic and individualized functional mapping with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for time-saving pipeline processing. For example, sensorimotor and language-related components can be automatically identified without human input interference using an effective, accurate component identification algorithm using discriminability index. All the results generated can be further evaluated and compared by neuro-radiologists or neurosurgeons. This software has substantial value for clinical neuro-radiology and neuro-oncology, including application to patients with low- and high-grade brain tumors and those with epilepsy foci in the dominant language hemisphere who are planning to undergo a temporal lobectomy.

Cluster failure revisited: Impact of first level design and physiological noise on cluster false positive rates	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cluster inference; false positives; functional magnetic resonance imaging; ICA FIX; permutation; physiological noise	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NON-GAUSSIAN SOURCES; FMRI INFERENCES; SPATIAL EXTENT; ACQUISITION; CLASSIFICATION	Methodological research rarely generates a broad interest, yet our work on the validity of cluster inference methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) created intense discussion on both the minutia of our approach and its implications for the discipline. In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomization of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all data sets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (p = .01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.

The main objectives of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study are (1) to investigate brain activity during phonation in women with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) in comparison with healthy controls; and (2) to explain the neurophysiological mechanism of laryngeal hyperfunction/tension during phonation in patients with MTD. Methods. Ten women with MTD and fifteen healthy women participated in this study. The fMRI experiment was carried out using a block design paradigm. Brain activation during phonation and exhalation was analyzed using BrainVoyager software. Results. The statistical analysis of fMRI data has demonstrated that MTD patients control phonation by use of the auditory, motor, frontal, parietal, and subcortical areas similar to phonation control by healthy people. Comparison of phonation tasks in the two groups revealed higher brain activities in the precentral gyrus, inferior, middle and superior frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, insula, cerebellum, midbrain, and brainstem as well as lower brain activities in the cingulate gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobe in the MTD group. No differences were found between the two groups regarding exhalation control. Conclusions. The findings in this study provide insight into phonation and exhalation control in patients with MTD. The imaging results demonstrated that in patients with MTD, altered (higher/lower) brain activities may result in laryngeal tension and vocal hyperfunction.

The Rewarding Effect of Pictures with Positive Emotional Connotation upon Perception and Processing of Pleasant Odors-An FMRI Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						conditioning; odors; fMRI; baby pictures	REGIONAL BRAIN RESPONSES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; UNPLEASANT ODORS; IDENTIFICATION; INTENSITY; TASTE; REPRESENTATIONS; DISCRIMINATION; STIMULATION; JUDGMENT	This fMRI study was designed to investigate the effect of cross-modal conditioning in 28 female volunteers. Subjects underwent initial fMRI block design scanning during which three pleasant olfactory stimuli were presented and had to be rated with respect to intensity and pleasantness. This was followed by an odor identification task spread out over 3 days: the experimental group was rewarded for successful trials (correct odor identification) with emotionally salient photos, whilst the control group only received randomly displayed, emotionally neutral, pictures. In the final scanning session, the odors were again presented, and subjects rated pleasantness and intensity. Both pleasantness ratings and fMRI data showed effects of the rewarding procedure. Activation in nucleus accumbens and the orbitofrontal cortex confirmed the hypothesis that learnt association of odors with visual stimuli of emotionally positive valence not only increases pleasantness of the olfactory stimuli but is also reflected in the activation of brain structures relevant for hedonic and reward processing. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report successful cross-modal conditioning of olfactory stimuli with visual clues.

Thirteen healthy female volunteers from the local community participated in the study. An echo planar imaging sequence for fMRI has used to examine the effect on the cerebral cortex before and after SGB stimulation at 1.5T MRI. We used 6 mL of 1 % mepivacaine hydrochloride as a local anesthetic. Two control groups with and without a saline injection were also included. FMRI data were processed using statistical parametric mapping. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI signal intensities increased in contralateral anterior cingulate cortex, hypothalamus, ventral putamen, and parahippocampal gyrus after SGB stimulation, while the signal intensities had decreased in contralateral thalamus and dorsal putamen, and ipsilateral caudate nucleus. In the saline control group, the signal intensities in ipsilateral posterior putamen and superior temporal gyrus and both insular cortices have increased significantly. The present study could show the changes by SGB in the several important brain areas associated with sympathetic nervous system. The non-invasive and repeatable imaging technique of fMRI could provide some useful information for better understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in SGB treatments.

American Society of Functional Neuroradiology-Recommended fMRI Paradigm Algorithms for Presurgical Language Assessment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; WORD-GENERATION; CLINICAL FMRI; BRAIN-TUMORS; BREATH-HOLD; BOLD SIGNAL; NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION; WADA TEST; MRI	INTRODUCTION: Functional MR imaging is increasingly being used for presurgical language assessment in the treatment of patients with brain tumors, epilepsy, vascular malformations, and other conditions. The inherent complexity of fMRI, which includes numerous processing steps and selective analyses, is compounded by institution-unique approaches to patient training, paradigm choice, and an eclectic array of postprocessing options from various vendors. Consequently, institutions perform fMRI in such markedly different manners that data sharing, comparison, and generalization of results are difficult. The American Society of Functional Neuroradiology proposes widespread adoption of common fMRI language paradigms as the first step in countering this lost opportunity to advance our knowledge and improve patient care. LANGUAGE PARADIGM REVIEW PROCESS: A taskforce of American Society of Functional Neuroradiology members from multiple institutions used a broad literature review, member polls, and expert opinion to converge on 2 sets of standard language paradigms that strike a balance between ease of application and clinical usefulness. ASFNR RECOMMENDATIONS: The taskforce generated an adult language paradigm algorithm for presurgical language assessment including the following tasks: Sentence Completion, Silent Word Generation, Rhyming, Object Naming, and/or Passive Story Listening. The pediatric algorithm includes the following tasks: Sentence Completion, Rhyming, Antonym Generation, or Passive Story Listening. DISCUSSION: Convergence of fMRI language paradigms across institutions offers the first step in providing a Rosetta Stone that provides a common reference point with which to compare and contrast the usefulness and reliability of fMRI data. From this common language task battery, future refinements and improvements are anticipated, particularly as objective measures of reliability become available. Some commonality of practice is a necessary first step to develop a foundation on which to improve the clinical utility of this field.	[Black, D.

The current study aimed to comprehensively analyze the olfactory function of patients with euthymic BD using psychophysical, electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. Twenty-one patients with BD in remission and 20 healthy controls were tested with the "Sniffin' Sticks" olfactory test. Block-design fMRI data to a pleasant and an unpleasant stimulus were acquired while recording intensity and hedonic ratings. Olfactory event-related potentials (OERP) to the same stimuli were additionally recorded. Results show no differences between patients and healthy controls in terms of self-rated olfactory function and tested olfactory domains (odor threshold, discrimination or identification) (p > 0.05). Compared to healthy controls, patients showed an increased fMRI activation in multiple cortical and subcortical regions as a response to olfactory stimulation, as well as larger amplitudes of OERPs regardless of the hedonic valence of the odor. All in all, patients with euthymic BD showed a stronger central responsiveness to odorous stimuli in fMRI and OERPs despite of normal psychophysical results, indicating the probable existence of an odor-related over-reactive brain network in the remission phase of BD.
