However, the misalignment of the localizations between fMRI and EEG activities may degrade the accuracy of the fMRI-constrained EEG source imaging (ESI) technique. To leverage the complementary spatiotemporal resolution of fMRI and EEG in a data-driven fashion, we propose an asymmetric approach for EEG/fMRI fusion, termed fMRI-informed source imaging based on spatiotemporal basis functions (fMRI-SI-STBF). fMRI-SI-STBF employs the covariance components (CCs) derived from clusters defined by fMRI and EEG signals as spatial priors within the empirical Bayesian framework. Additionally, fMRI-SI-STBF represents the current source matrix as a linear combination of several unknown temporal basis functions (TBFs) by matrix decomposition. The relative contribution of each of the fMRI-informed and EEG-informed CCs, as well as the number and profiles of the TBFs, are all automatically determined based on the EEG data using variational Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that fMRI-SI-STBF can effectively utilize valid fMRI information for ESI and is robust to invalid fMRI priors. This robustness is essential for practical ESI since the validity of fMRI priors is often unclear considering that fMRI is an indirect measure of neural activity. Moreover, fMRI-SI-STBF can achieve performance improvement by incorporating temporal constraints compared to methods that use spatial constraints only. For the numerical simulations, fMRI-SISTBF reconstructs the source extents, locations and time courses more accurately than existing EEG-fMRI ESI methods (i.e., fwMNE, fMRI-SI-SBF) and ESI methods without fMRI priors (i.e., wMNE, LORETA, SBL, SISTBF, SI-SBF), indicated by the smaller spatial dispersion (average SD < 5 mm), distance of localization error (average DLE < 2 mm), shape error (average SE < 0:9) and larger model evidence values.

Mapping language function with task-based vs. resting-state functional MRI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-TUMORS; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; NETWORK; IMPLEMENTATION; SYSTEM; MOTOR; ORGANIZATION; ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION	Background Use of functional MRI (fMRI) in pre-surgical planning is a non-invasive method for pre-operative functional mapping for patients with brain tumors, especially tumors located near eloquent cortex. Currently, this practice predominantly involves task-based fMRI (T-fMRI). Resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) offers an alternative with several methodological advantages. Here, we compare group-level analyses of RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as methods for language localization. Purpose To contrast RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as techniques for localization of language function. Methods We analyzed data obtained in 35 patients who had both T-fMRI and RS-fMRI scans during the course of pre-surgical evaluation. The RS-fMRI data were analyzed using a previously trained resting-state network classifier. The T-fMRI data were analyzed using conventional techniques. Group-level results obtained by both methods were evaluated in terms of two outcome measures: (1) inter-subject variability of response magnitude and (2) sensitivity/specificity analysis of response topography, taking as ground truth previously reported maps of the language system based on intraoperative cortical mapping as well as meta-analytic maps of language task fMRI responses. Results Both fMRI methods localized major components of the language system (areas of Broca and Wernicke) although not with equal inter-subject consistency. Word-stem completion T-fMRI strongly activated Broca's area but also several task-general areas not specific to language. RS-fMRI provided a more specific representation of the language system. Conclusion We demonstrate several advantages of classifier-based mapping of language representation in the brain. Language T-fMRI activated task-general (i.e., not language-specific) functional systems in addition to areas of Broca and Wernicke. In contrast, classifier-based analysis of RS-fMRI data generated maps confined to language-specific regions of the brain.

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a potential alternative modality for presurgical mapping of language networks that does not require task performance. The purpose of our study is to determine the utility of rs-fMRI for clinical preoperative language mapping when tb-fMRI is limited. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 134 brain tumor patients who underwent preoperative fMRI language mapping. rs-fMRI was post-processed with seed-based correlation (SBC) analysis, when language tb-fMRI was limited. Two neuroradiologists reviewed both the tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI results. Six neurosurgeons retrospectively rated the usefulness of rs-fMRI for language mapping in their patients. Results Of the 134 patients, 49 cases had limited tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI was post-processed. Two neuroradiologists found rs-fMRI beneficial for functional language mapping in 41(84%) and 43 (88%) cases respectively; Cohen's kappa is 0.83, with a 95% confidence interval (0.61, 1.00). The neurosurgeons found rs-fMRI "definitely" useful in 26 cases (60%) and "somewhat" useful in 13 cases (30%) in locating potential eloquent language centers of clinical interest. Six unsuccessful rs-fMRI cases were due to: head motion (2 cases), nonspecific functionality connectivity outside the posterior language network (1 case), and an unknown system instability (3 cases). Conclusions This study is a proof of concept that shows SBC rs-fMRI may be a viable alternative for clinical language mapping when tb-fMRI is limited.

While NF-EEG (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from EEG signals) has been explored for a very long time, NF-fMRI (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI signals) appeared more recently and provides more robust results and more specific brain training. Using fMRI and EEG simultaneously for bi-modal neurofeedback sessions (NF-EEG-fMRI, in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI and EEG) is very promising for the design of brain rehabilitation protocols. However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different NF-predictors stemming from the proposed model. We showed that predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG scores and significantly improves the correlation with bi-modal NF sessions compared to classical NF-EEG scores.

Our pioneering study in 31 adolescents with ADHD showed that fMRI-NF of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) and of the left parahippocampal gyrus (1PHG) was associated with clinical improvements. Previous studies using electro-encephalography-NF have shown, however, that not all ADHD patients learn to self-regulate, and the predictors of fMRI-NF self-regulation learning are not presently known. The aim of the current study was therefore to elucidate the potential predictors of fMRI-NF learning by investigating the relationship between fMRI-NF learning and baseline inhibitory brain function during an fMRI stop task, along with clinical and cognitive measures. fMRI-NF learning capacity was calculated for each participant by correlating the number of completed fMRI-NF runs with brain activation in their respective target regions from each run (rIFC or lPHG); higher correlation values were taken as a marker of better (linear) fMRI-NF learning. Linear correlations were then conducted between baseline measures and the participants' capacity for fMRI-NF learning. Better fMRI-NF learning was related to increased activation in left inferior fronto-striatal regions during the fMRI stop task. Poorer self-regulation during fMRI-NF training was associated with enhanced activation in posterior temporo-occipital and cerebellar regions. Cognitive and clinical measures were not associated with general fMRI-NF learning across all participants. A categorical analysis showed that 48% of adolescents with ADHD successfully learned fMRI-NF and this was also not associated with any baseline clinical or cognitive measures except that faster processing speed during inhibition and attention tasks predicted learning. Taken together, the findings suggest that imaging data are more predictive of fMRI-NF self-regulation skills in ADHD than behavioural data. Stronger baseline activation in fronto-striatal cognitive control regions predicts better fMRI-NF learning in ADHD.

However, it remains an open issue whether the tool is useful in the clinical setting compared to task-based fMRI (T-fMRI) and intraoperative mapping. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the usefulness of this technique. Methods A systematic literature search of rs-fMRI methods applied as a pre-operative mapping tool was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library electronic databases following PRISMA guidelines. Results Results demonstrated that 50% (six out of twelve) of the studies comparing rs-fMRI and T-fMRI showed good concordance for both language and sensorimotor networks. In comparison to intraoperative mapping, 86% (six out of seven) studies found a good agreement to rs-fMRI. Finally, 87% (twenty out of twenty-three) studies agreed that rs-fMRI is a suitable and useful pre-operative mapping tool. Conclusions rs-fMRI is a promising technique for pre-operative mapping in assessing the functional brain areas. However, the agreement between rs-fMRI with other techniques, including T-fMRI and intraoperative maps, is not yet optimal. Studies to ascertain and improve the sophistication in pre-processing of rs-fMRI imaging data are needed.

Striving toward translation: strategies for reliable fMRI measurement	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; MULTI-ECHO FMRI; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DISTRIBUTED NETWORKS; STATISTICAL POWER; HEAD MOTION; RELIABILITY; STATE; BOLD; NEUROSCIENCE	fMRI has considerable potential as a translational tool for understanding risk, prioritizing interventions, and improving the treatment of brain disorders. However, recent studies have found that many of the most widely used fMRI measures have low reliability, undermining this potential. Here, we argue that many fMRI measures are unreliable because they were designed to identify group effects, not to precisely quantify individual differences. We then highlight four emerging strategies [extended aggregation, reliability modeling, multiecho fMRI (ME-fMRI), and stimulus design] that build on established psychometric properties to generate more precise and reliable fMRI measures. By adopting such strategies to improve reliability, we are optimistic that fMRI can fulfill its potential as a clinical tool.

Interleaved reverse-gradient fMRI (RG-fMRI) with a point-spread-function (PSF) mapping-based distortion correction scheme has the potential to minimize signal loss in echo-planar-imaging (EPI). In this work, the RG-fMRI is further improved by imaging protocol optimization and application of reverse Fourier acquisition. Approach. Multi-band imaging was adapted for RG-fMRI to improve the temporal and spatial resolution. To better understand signal dropouts in forward and reverse EPIs, a simple theoretical relationship between echo shift and geometric distortion was derived and validated by the reliable measurements using PSF mapping method. After examining practical imaging protocols for RG-fMRI in three subjects on both a conventional whole-body and a high-performance compact 3 T, the results were compared and the feasibility to further improve the RG-fMRI scheme were explored. High-resolution breath-holding RG-fMRI was conducted with nine subjects on the compact 3 T and the fMRI reliability improvement in high susceptibility brain regions was demonstrated. Finally, reverse Fourier acquisition was applied to RG-fMRI, and its benefit was assessed by a simulation study based on the breath-holding RG-fMRI data. Main results. The temporal and spatial resolution of the multi-band RG-fMRI became feasible for whole-brain fMRI. Echo shift measurements from PSF mapping well estimated signal dropout effects in the EPI pair and were useful to further improve the RG-fMRI scheme. Breath-holding RG-fMRI demonstrated improved fMRI reliability in high susceptibility brain regions. Reverse partial Fourier acquisition omitting the late echoes could further improve the temporal or spatial resolution for RG-fMRI without noticeable signal degradation and spatial resolution loss. Significance. With the improved imaging scheme, RG-fMRI could reliably investigate the functional mechanisms of the human brain in the temporal and frontal areas suffering from susceptibility-induced functional sensitivity loss.

Task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) is commonly utilized for the noninvasive, accurate evaluation of eloquent cortex implicated in sensorimotor, language, and visual function. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is being increasingly employed in addition to tb-fMRI and may be able to serve as an adjunct for tb-fMRI for presurgical mapping in the future. There is, however, a need to confirm the reliability of rs-fMRI data in various clinical contexts, and more validation and standardization is necessary prior to adopting this tool for daily clinical care. Although tb-fMRI has been proved to be a trustworthy method, the problem of neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) needs to be addressed to give the most accurate functional evaluation in clinical practice. Breath-hold cerebrovascular reactivity (BH-CVR) methods can be used to assess risk of NVU. We hope that future research will investigate and overcome the problem of NVU encountered in presurgical brain mapping with BOLD fMRI.Abstract Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) technique is useful for preoperative mapping of brain functional networks in tumor patients, providing reliable in vivo detection of eloquent cortex to help reduce the risk of postsurgical morbidity. BOLD task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) is the most often used noninvasive method that can reliably map cortical networks, including those associated with sensorimotor, language, and visual functions. BOLD resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is emerging as a promising ancillary tool for visualization of diverse functional networks. Although fMRI is a powerful tool that can be used as an adjunct for brain tumor surgery planning, it has some constraints that should be taken into consideration for proper clinical interpretation. BOLD fMRI interpretation may be limited by neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) induced by brain tumors. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) mapping obtained using breath-hold methods is an effective method for evaluating NVU potential.

Nonetheless, uncertainty surrounding the origins of fMRI hemodynamic signals, and in the link between large-scale fMRI patterns and ongoing functional states, presently limits the neurobiological conclusions one can draw from fMRI alone. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides complementary information about neural electrical activity and state change, and simultaneously acquiring EEG together with fMRI presents unique opportunities for studying large-scale brain activity and gaining more information from fMRI itself. Here, we discuss the recent progress in the use of concurrent EEG-fMRI to enrich the investigation of neural and physiological states and clarify the origins of fMRI hemodynamic signals. Throughout, we outline perspectives on future directions and open challenges.

Moreover, the neuronal implications of such age effects and age-sex interaction remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of age and sex on the rs-fMRI signal frequency using the Leipzig mind-brain-body data set. Over a frequency band of up to 0.3 Hz, we found that the rs-fMRI fluctuation frequency is higher in the older adults, although the fluctuation amplitude is lower. The rs-fMRI signal frequency is also higher in men than in women. Both age and sex effects on fMRI frequency vary with the frequency band examined but are not found in the frequency of physiological-noise components. This higher rs-fMRI frequency in older adults is not mediated by the electroencephalograph (EEG)-frequency increase but a likely link between fMRI signal frequency and EEG entropy, which vary with age and sex. Additionally, in different rs-fMRI frequency bands, the fMRI-EEG amplitude ratio is higher in young adults. This is the first study to investigate the neuronal contribution to age and sex effects in the frequency dimension of the rs-fMRI signal and may lead to the development of new, frequency-based rs-fMRI metrics. Our study demonstrates that Fourier analysis of the fMRI signal can reveal novel information about aging. Furthermore, fMRI and EEG signals reflect different aspects of age- and sex-related brain differences, but the signal frequency and complexity, instead of amplitude, may hold their link.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						resting-state fMRI; task-based fMRI; language lateralization; surgical technique	FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; HANDEDNESS; OUTCOMES	OBJECTIVE Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) is now considered the standard, noninvasive technique in establishing language laterality in children for surgical planning. The evaluation can be limited due to several factors such as age, language barriers, and developmental and cognitive delays. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) offers a potential path to establish language dominance without active task participation. The authors sought to compare the ability of rsfMRI for language lateralization in the pediatric population with conventional tb-fMRI used as the gold standard. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective evaluation of all pediatric patients at a dedicated quaternary pediatric hospital who underwent tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI from 2019 to 2021 as part of the surgical workup for patients with seizures and brain tumors. Task-based fMRI language laterality was based on a patient's adequate performance on one or more of the following: sentence completion, verb generation, antonym generation, or passive listening tasks. Restingstate fMRI data were postprocessed using statistical parametric mapping, FMRIB Software Library, and FreeSurfer as described in the literature. The laterality index (LI) was calculated from the independent component (IC) with the highest Jaccard Index (JI) for the language mask. Additionally, the authors visually inspected the activation maps for two ICs with the highest JIs. The rs-fMRI LI of IC1 and the authors' image-based subjective interpretation of language lateralization were compared with tb-fMRI, which was considered the gold standard for this study. RESULTS A retrospective search yielded 33 patients with language fMRI data. Eight patients were excluded (5 with suboptimal tb-fMRI and 3 with suboptimal rs-fMRI data). Twenty-five patients (age range 7-19 years, male/female ratio 15:10) were included in the study. The language laterality concordance between tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI ranged from 68% to 80% for assessment based on LI of independent component analysis with highest JI and for subjective evaluation by visual inspection of activation maps, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The concordance rates between tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI of 68% to 80% show the limitation of rs-fMRI in determining language dominance. Resting-state fMRI should not be used as the sole method for language lateralization in clinical practice.

Application of fMRI and Simultaneous fMRI-EEG Neurofeedback in Post-Stroke Motor Rehabilitation	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						ischemic stroke; fMRI neurofeedback; motor imagery; supplementary motor area; EEG mu band	REAL-TIME FMRI; CONNECTIVITY	This article discusses the contribution of fMRI- and fMRI-EEG-neurofeedback into recovery of motor function in two subacute stroke patients during the early post-stroke period. Premotor and supplementary motor zones of the cortex were chosen as the targets of voluntary control. Patient 1 received 6 sessions of motor imagery-based fMRI neurofeedback of secondary motor areas activity and Patient 2 received a similar course with the addition of mu- and beta-EEG activity suppression. Both reduced the motor deficit severity, improved on the quality of life, and increased the C3/C4 coherence to other central leads within EEG mu-band. Patient 1 reliably increased the fMRI signal in target areas and improved on the strength and speed of hand movements. Patient 2 (fMRI-EEG) mastered the EEG activity regulation to a greater degree. The authors conclude that pure fMRI neurofeedback and bi-modal fMRI-EEG neurofeedback produce different clinical effects in motor rehabilitation, which confirms the prospect of the closed-loop stroke treatment.

One is through changes in deoxyhemoglobin in venules, i.e., blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, while the second is through changes in arteriole diameter, i.e., cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Here, we introduce cerebral blood flow-related velocity-based fMRI, denoted CBFv-fMRI, which uses high-resolution phase contrast (PC) MRI to form velocity measurements of flow. We use CBFv-fMRI in measure changes in blood velocity in single penetrating microvessels across rat parietal cortex. In contrast to the venule-dominated BOLD and arteriole-dominated CBV fMRI signals, CBFv-fMRI is comparable from both arterioles and venules. A single fMRI platform is used to map changes in blood pO(2) (BOLD), volume (CBV), and velocity (CBFv). This combined high-resolution single-vessel fMRI mapping scheme enables vessel-specific hemodynamic mapping in animal models of normal and diseased states and further has translational potential to map vascular dementia in diseased or injured human brains with ultra-high-field fMRI.

Previous studies have decoded a perceived image from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity by constructing brain decoding models that were trained with a single subject's fMRI data. However, accurate decoding is still challenging since fMRI data acquired from only a single subject have several disadvantageous characteristics such as small sample size, noisy nature, and high dimensionality. In this article, we propose a method to decode categories of perceived images from fMRI activity using shared information of multi-subject fMRI data. Specifically, by aggregating fMRI data of multiple subjects that contain a large number of samples, we extract a low-dimensional latent representation shared by multi-subject fMRI data. Then the latent representation is nonlinearly transformed into visual features and semantic features of the perceived images to identify categories from various candidate categories. Our approach leverages rich information obtained from multi-subject fMRI data and improves the decoding performance. Experimental results obtained by using two public fMRI datasets showed that the proposed method can more accurately decode categories of perceived images from fMRI activity than previous approaches using a single subject's fMRI data.

Objective. In this review, we focus on the use of EEG and fMRI in neurofeedback (NF) and discuss the challenges of combining the two modalities to improve understanding of brain activity and achieve more effective clinical outcomes. Advanced technologies have been developed to simultaneously record EEG and fMRI signals to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the two modalities. However, the complexity of brain processes and the heterogeneous nature of EEG and fMRI present challenges in extracting useful information from the combined data. Approach. We will survey existing EEG-fMRI combinations and recent studies that exploit EEG-fMRI in NF, highlighting the experimental and technical challenges. Main results. We made a classification of the different combination of EEG-fMRI for NF, we provide a review of multimodal analysis methods for EEG-fMRI features. We also survey the current state of research on EEG-fMRI in the different existing NF paradigms. Finally, we also identify some of the remaining challenges in this field. Significance. By exploring EEG-fMRI combinations in NF, we are advancing our knowledge of brain function and its applications in clinical settings. As such, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in the field of neural engineering and rehabilitation, highlighting the promising future of EEG-fMRI-based NF.

Previous studies have shown that regional homogeneity (ReHo) of rest_fMRI (rest_ReHo_fMRI) is a characterization of the functional synchronization of adjacent voxels in brain regions, and the mental and behavioral abnormalities in depression are due to an imbalance of ReHo synchronization in some brain functional areas. Accordingly, this paper presents a method for depression recognition using rest_ReHo_fMRI. First, the rest_ReHo_fMRI is extracted from the preprocessed rest-fMRI by calculation. Then, deep convolutional networks (such as VGG16) pretrained on ImageNet are used to automatically complete extracting the classification features from rest_ReHo_fMRI. Finally, the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) was used to classify the depression. The results of the test set show that the proposed method achieves 89.07% in sensitivity and 89.74% in specificity. This study suggests that features of rest_ReHo_fMRI can be used as biomarkers to distinguish depression from normal people.

Resting-State Functional MRI for Determining Language Lateralization in Children with Drug-Resistant Epilepsy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FMRI; SURGERY; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; ROBUST	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Task-based fMRI is a noninvasive method of determining language dominance; however, not all children can complete language tasks due to age, cognitive/intellectual, or language barriers. Task-free approaches such as resting-state fMRI offer an alternative method. This study evaluated resting-state fMRI for predicting language laterality in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 43 children with drug-resistant epilepsy who had undergone resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI during presurgical evaluation was conducted. Independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI was used to identify language networks by comparing the independent components with a language network template. Concordance rates in language laterality between resting-state fMRI and each of the 4 task-based fMRI language paradigms (auditory description decision, auditory category, verbal fluency, and silent word generation tasks) were calculated. RESULTS: Concordance ranged from 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48?0.65) to 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58?0.87), depending on the language paradigm, with the highest concordance found for the auditory description decision task. Most (78%?83%) patients identified as left-lateralized on task-based fMRI were correctly classified as left-lateralized on resting-state fMRI. No patients classified as right-lateralized or bilateral on task-based fMRI were correctly classified by resting-state fMRI. CONCLUSIONS: While resting-state fMRI correctly classified most patients who had typical (left) language dominance, its ability to correctly classify patients with atypical (right or bilateral) language dominance was poor. Further study is required before resting-state fMRI can be used clinically for language mapping in the context of epilepsy surgery evaluation in children with drug-resistant epilepsy.	[Phillips, N.

We developed a real-time fMRI platform to guide experimenters to monitor fMRI responses instantaneously during acquisition, which can be used to modify the physiology of animals to achieve desired hemodynamic responses in animal brains. The real-time fMRI set-up is based on a 14.1T preclinical MRI system, enabling the real-time mapping of dynamic fMRI responses in the primary forepaw somatosensory cortex (FP-S1) of anesthetized rats. Instead of a retrospective analysis to investigate confounding sources leading to the variability of fMRI signals, the real-time fMRI platform provides a more effective scheme to identify dynamic fMRI responses using customized macro-functions and a common neuroimage analysis software in the MRI system. Also, it provides immediate troubleshooting feasibility and a real-time biofeedback stimulation paradigm for brain functional studies in animals.

However, affective neuroscience remains somewhat behind in embracing this approach, even though films lend themselves to study how brain function gives rise to complex, dynamic and multivariate emotions. Here, we discuss the unique capabilities of film fMRI for emotion research, while providing a general guide of conducting such research. We first give a brief overview of emotion theories as these inform important design choices. Next, we discuss films as experimental paradigms for emotion elicitation and address the process of annotating them. We then situate film fMRI in the context of other fMRI approaches, and present an overview of results from extant studies so far with regard to advantages of film fMRI. We also give an overview of state-of-the-art analysis techniques including methods that probe neurodynamics. Finally, we convey limitations of using film fMRI to study emotion. In sum, this review offers a practitioners' guide to the emerging field of film fMRI and underscores how it can advance affective neuroscience.

Mapping of the Language Network With Deep Learning	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						functional MRI; language; deep learning; resting state network; convolutional neural network	SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; CORE SYSTEM; FMRI; CORTEX; RESECTION; IMPLEMENTATION; LOCALIZATION; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION	Background:Pre-surgical functional localization of eloquent cortex with task-based functional MRI (T-fMRI) is part of the current standard of care prior to resection of brain tumors. Resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) is an alternative method currently under investigation. Here, we compare group level language localization using T-fMRI vs. RS-fMRI analyzed with 3D deep convolutional neural networks (3DCNN). Methods:We analyzed data obtained in 35 patients with brain tumors that had both language T-fMRI and RS-MRI scans during pre-surgical evaluation. The T-fMRI data were analyzed using conventional techniques. The language associated resting state network was mapped using a 3DCNN previously trained with data acquired in >2,700 normal subjects. Group level results obtained by both methods were evaluated using receiver operator characteristic analysis of probability maps of language associated regions, taking as ground truth meta-analytic maps of language T-fMRI responses generated on the Neurosynth platform. Results:Both fMRI methods localized major components of the language system (areas of Broca and Wernicke). Word-stem completion T-fMRI strongly activated Broca's area but also several task-general areas not specific to language. RS-fMRI provided a more specific representation of the language system. Conclusion:3DCNN was able to accurately localize the language network. Additionally, 3DCNN performance was remarkably tolerant of a limited quantity of RS-fMRI data.

Brain networks can also be generated from tb-fMRI by using independent component analysis (ICA). Purpose: To investigate whether the SMN can be identified by using ICA from a language task without a motor component, the sentence completion functional MRI (sc-fMRI) task, compared with rs-fMRI. Materials and Methods: The sc-fMRI and rs-fMRI scans in patients who underwent presurgical brain mapping between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed, using the same imaging parameters (other than scanning time) on a 3.0-T MRI scanner. ICA was performed on rs-fMRI and sc-fMRI scans with use of a tool to separate data sets into their spatial and temporal components. Two neuroradiologists independently determined the presence of the dorsal SMN (dSMN) and ventral SMN (vSMN) on each study. Groups were compared by using t tests, and logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of the presence of SMNs. Results: One hundred patients (mean age, 40.9 years. 14.8 [standard deviation]; 61 men) were evaluated. The dSMN and vSMN were identified in 86% (86 of 100) and 76% (76 of 100) of rs-fMRI scans and 85% (85 of 100) and 69% (69 of 100) of sc-fMRI scans, respectively. The concordance between rs-fMRI and sc-fMRI for presence of dSMN and vSMN was 75% (75 of 100 patients) and 53% (53 of 100 patients), respectively. In 10 of 14 patients (71%) where rs-fMRI did not show the dSMN, sc-fMRI demonstrated it. This rate was 67% for the vSMN (16 of 24 patients). Conclusion: In the majority of patients, independent component analysis of sentence completion task functional MRI scans reliably demonstrated the somatomotor network compared with resting-state functional MRI scans. Identifying target networks with a single sentence completion scan could reduce overall functional MRI scanning times by eliminating the need for separate motor tasks.

Assessment of cerebral blood flow with [O-15]water PET and acetazolamide challenge is the diagnostic standard for the evaluation of the cerebral perfusion reserve (CPR). Estimation of the cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) by use of breath-hold-triggered fMRI (bh-fMRI) as an index of CPR has been proposed as a reliable and more readily available approach. Recent findings suggest the use of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) which requires minimum patient compliance. The aim of this study was to compare rs-fMRI to bh-fMRI and [O-15]water PET in patients with MMA. Methods Patients with MMA underwent rs-fMRI and bh-fMRI in the same MRI session. Maps of the CVR gained by both modalities were compared retrospectively by calculating the correlation between the mean CVR of 12 volumes of interest. Additionally, the rs-maps of a subgroup of patients were compared to CPR-maps gained by [O-15]water PET. Results The comparison of the rs-maps and the bh-maps of 24 patients revealed a good correlation (Pearson's r = 0.71 +/- 0.13; preoperative patients: Pearson's r = 0.71 +/- 0.17; postoperative patients: Pearson's r = 0.71 +/- 0.11). The comparison of 7 rs-fMRI data sets to the corresponding [O-15]water PET data sets also revealed a high level of agreement (Pearson's r = 0.80 +/- 0.19). Conclusion The present analysis indicates that rs-fMRI might be a promising non-invasive method with almost no patient cooperation needed to evaluate the CVR. Further prospective studies are required.

Extracting such timing information from blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals is confounded by local cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR), which varies across brain locations. Thus, detecting neuronal synchrony as well as inferring inter-regional causal modulation using fMRI signals can be biased. Here we used fast fMRI measurements sampled at 10 Hz to measure the fMRI latency difference between visual and sensorimotor areas when participants engaged in a visuomotor task. The regional fMRI timing was calibrated by subtracting the CVR latency measured by a breath-holding task. After CVR calibration, the fMRI signal at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) preceded that at the visual cortex by 496 ms, followed by the fMRI signal at the sensorimotor cortex with a latency of 464 ms. Sequential LGN, visual, and sensorimotor cortex activations were found in each participant after the CVR calibration. These inter-regional fMRI timing differences across and within participants were more closely related to the reaction time after the CVR calibration. Our results suggested the feasibility of mapping brain activity using fMRI with accuracy in hundreds of milliseconds.

Reviewing applications of structural and functional MRI for bipolar disorder	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY			English	Review						Neuroimaging; fMRI; Biomarkers; Grey matter; White matter; Resting-state fMRI; Psychiatric disorders; Bipolar depression disorder; Mood disorder	AMYGDALA VOLUMES; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; METAANALYSIS; MORPHOMETRY; PSYCHOSIS; INSULA	Bipolar disorders (BDs) represent one of the leading causes of disability and morbidity globally. The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is being increasingly studied as a tool to improve the diagnosis and treatment of BDs. While morphological biomarkers can be identified through the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), recent studies have demonstrated that varying degrees of both structural and functional impairments indicate differing bipolar subtypes. Within fMRI, resting-state fMRI has specifically drawn increased interest for its capability to detect different neuronal activation patterns compared to task-based fMRI. This study aims to review recently published literature regarding the use of fMRI to investigate structural-functional relationships in BD diagnosis and specifically resting-state fMRI to provide an opinion on fMRI's modern clinical application. All sources in this literature review were collected through searches on both PubMed and Google Scholar databases for terms such as 'resting-state fMRI' and 'functional neuroimaging biomarkers of bipolar disorder'. While there are promising results supporting the use of fMRI for improving differential accuracy and establishing clinically relevant biomarkers, additional evidence will be required before fMRI is considered a dependable component of the overall BD diagnostic process.

Various imaging modalities have documented specific abnormalities in Friedreich's ataxia that could be tracked to provide useful indicators of efficacy in clinical trials. Advanced MRI imaging (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; functional MRI, fMRI; and resting-state fMRI, rs-fMRI) and retinal imaging (optical coherence tomography, OCT) were tested longitudinally in a small group of Friedreich's ataxia patients participating in an open-label clinical trial testing the safety and the efficacy of 6-month treatment with interferon gamma. While the DTI indices documented the slow progression of fractional anisotropy loss, fMRI and rs-fMRI were significantly modified during and after treatment. The fMRI changes significantly correlated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, which is used to monitor clinical response. OCT documented the known thickness reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, but there was no change over time. This pilot study provides indications for the potential utility of fMRI and rs-fMRI as ancillary measures in clinical trials for Friedreich's ataxia.

From the last decade, there is an exponential rise in the use of the machine and deep learning algorithms of artificial intelligence for analysing fMRI data. However, it is a big challenge for every researcher to choose a suitable machine or deep learning algorithm for analysing fMRI data due to the availability of a large number of algorithms in the literature. It takes much time for each researcher to know about the various approaches and algorithms which are in use for fMRI data. This paper provides a review in a systematic manner for the present literature of fMRI data that makes use of the machine and deep learning algorithms. The major goals of this review paper are to (a) identify machine learning and deep learning research trends for the implementation of fMRI; (b) identify usage of Machine Learning Algorithms and deep learning in fMRI, and (c) help new researchers based on fMRI to put their new findings appropriately in existing domain of fMRI research. The results of this systematic review identified various fMRI studies and classified them based on fMRI types, mental diseases, use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The authors have provided the studies with the best performance of machine learning and deep learning algorithms used in fMRI. The authors believe that this systematic review will help incoming researchers on fMRI in their future works.

Preoperative functional MRI use in neurooncology patients: a clinician survey	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Article						brain mapping; functional MRI; neurooncology; neurosurgery; clinician survey	FMRI	OBJECTIVE Functional MRI (fMRI) is increasingly being investigated for use in neurosurgical patient care. In the current study, the authors characterize the clinical use of fMRI by surveying neurosurgeons' use of and attitudes toward fMRI as a surgical planning tool in neurooncology patients. METHODS A survey was developed to inquire about clinicians' use of and experiences with preoperative fMRI in the neurooncology patient population, including example case images. The survey was distributed to all neurosurgical departments with a residency program in the US. RESULTS After excluding incomplete surveys and responders that do not use fMRI (n = 11), 50 complete responses were included in the final analysis. Responders were predominantly from academic programs (88%), with 20 years or more in practice (40%), with a main area of practice in neurooncology (48%) and treating an adult population (90%). All 50 responders currently use fMRI in neurooncology patients, mostly for low- (94%) and high-grade glioma (82%). The leading decision factors for ordering fMRI were location of mass in dominant hemisphere, location in a functional area, motor symptoms, and aphasia. Across 10 cases, language fMRI yielded the highest interrater reliability agreement (Fleiss' kappa 0.437). The most common reasons for ordering fMRI were to identify language laterality, plan extent of resection, and discuss neurological risks with patients. Clinicians reported that fMRI results were not obtained when ordered a median 10% of the time and were suboptimal a median 27% of the time. Of responders, 70% reported that they had ever resected an fMRI-positive functional site, of whom 77% did so because the site was "cleared" by cortical stimulation. Responders reported disagreement between fMRI and awake surgery 30% of the time. Overall, 98% of responders reported that if results of fMRI and intraoperative mapping disagreed, they would rely on intraoperative mapping. CONCLUSIONS Although fMRI is increasingly being adopted as a practical preoperative planning tool for brain tumor resection, there remains a substantial degree of discrepancy with regard to its current use and presumed utility. There is a need for further research to evaluate the use of preoperative fMRI in neurooncology patients. As fMRI continues to gain prominence, it will be important for clinicians to collectively share best practices and develop guidelines for the use of fMRI in the preoperative planning phase of brain tumor patients.

In this review article, the focus will be on functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and its applicability in clinical fMRI studies. In the light of the "replication crisis," three aspects will be critically discussed: First, the fMRI signal itself, second, current fMRI praxis, and, third, the next generation of analysis strategies. Current attempts such as resting-state fMRI, meta-analyses, and machine learning will be discussed with their advantages and potential pitfalls and disadvantages. One major concern is that the fMRI signal shows substantial within- and between-subject variability, which affects the reliability of both task-related, but in particularly resting-state fMRI studies. Furthermore, the lack of standardized acquisition and analysis methods hinders the further development of clinical relevant approaches. However, meta-analyses and machine-learning approaches may help to overcome current shortcomings in the methods by identifying new, and yet hidden relationships, and may help to build new models on disorder mechanisms. Furthermore, better control of parameters that may have an influence on the fMRI signal and that can easily be controlled for, like blood pressure, heart rate, diet, time of day, might improve reliability substantially.

J	Polczynska, MM				Polczynska, Monika M.			Organizing Variables Affecting fMRI Estimates of Language Dominance in Patients with Brain Tumors	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Review						brain tumor; glioma; language dominance; laterality index; language; fMRI; confounds	RESTING-STATE FMRI; LOW-GRADE GLIOMA; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; SIGN-LANGUAGE; LATERALIZING LANGUAGE; STIMULATION; HANDEDNESS; EPILEPSY; SURGERY	Numerous variables can affect the assessment of language dominance using presurgical functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) in patients with brain tumors. This work organizes the variables into confounding and modulating factors. Confounding factors give the appearance of changed language dominance. Most confounding factors are fMRI-specific and they can substantially disrupt the evaluation of language dominance. Confounding factors can be divided into two categories: tumor-related and fMRI analysis. The tumor-related confounds further subdivide into tumor characteristics (e.g., tumor grade) and tumor-induced conditions (aphasia). The fMRI analysis confounds represent technical aspects of fMRI methods (e.g., a fixed versus an individual threshold). Modulating factors can modify language dominance without confounding it. They are not fMRI-specific, and they can impact language dominance both in healthy individuals and neurosurgical patients. The effect of most modulating factors on fMRI language dominance is smaller than that of confounding factors. Modulating factors include demographics (e.g., age) and linguistic variables (e.g., early bilingualism). Three cases of brain tumors in the left hemisphere are presented to illustrate how modulating confounding and modulating factors can impact fMRI estimates of language dominance. Distinguishing between confounding and modulating factors can help interpret the results of presurgical language mapping with fMRI.

This article focuses on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hyperscanning and identifies promising targets for studying the neuroscience of social interaction with fMRI hyperscanning. Specifically, we present applications of fMRI hyperscanning in the study of social interaction along with promising analysis approaches for fMRI hyperscanning, with its high spatial and low temporal resolution. We first review fMRI hyperscanning studies in social neuroscience and evaluate the premise of using this costly neuroimaging paradigm. Many second-person social neuroscience studies are possible without fMRI hyperscanning. However, certain fundamental aspects of social cognition in real-life social interactions, including different roles of interactors, shared intention emerging through interaction and history of interaction, can be addressed only with hyperscanning. We argue that these fundamental aspects have not often been investigated in fMRI hyperscanning studies. We then discuss the implication of the signal coupling found in fMRI hyperscanning and consider analysis approaches that make fair use of it. With fMRI hyperscanning, we can explore not only synchronous brain activations but whole-brain asymmetric activation patterns with a lagged association between interacting individuals.

Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG)/MB-fMRI has yet to be validated for data quality against conventional single band (SB)-fMRI. Pilot scans were conducted on phantoms twice and on a healthy volunteer to ensure no heating effects. In the main study, two thermometer probes were attached to 16 healthy individuals (ages 20-39, 9 females) whilst they completed two sets of 16-min resting-state and two sets of 9-min n-back task scans-each set consisting of one MB4 and one SB pulse sequence. No heating effects were reported and thermometer data showed mean increases of < 1.0 degrees C. Minimal differences between the two scan types were found in EEG channel variance and spectra. Expected decreases in MB4-fMRI tSNR were observed. In n-back task scans, little to no differences were detected in both EEG source analyses and fMRI local analyses for mixed effects. Resting-state posterior cingulate cortex seed-based analyses of the default mode network along with EEG-informed fMRI analysis of the occipital alpha anticorrelation effect showed improved statistical and spatial sensitivity at lower scan durations. Using EEG/MB4-fMRI for n-back tasks provided no statistical advantages nor disadvantages. However, for studying the resting-state, MB4-fMRI potentially allows for reduced scanning durations for equivalent statistical significance to be obtained or alternatively, larger effect sizes for the same scanning duration. As such, simultaneous EEG/MB4-fMRI is a viable alternative to EEG/SB-fMRI.	[Chen, Joseph C.

To answer this question we reviewed 160 papers published between 2004 and 2019. Reporting styles for methods and results of fMRI studies can differ greatly between published studies. However, adequate reporting is essential for the comprehension, replication and reuse of the study (for instance in a meta-analysis). To aid authors in reporting the methods and results of their task-based fMRI study the COBIDAS report was published in 2016, which provides researchers with clear guidelines on how to report the design, acquisition, preprocessing, statistical analysis and results (including data sharing) of fMRI studies (Nichols et al. in Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing in Neuroimaging using fMRI, 2016). In the past reviews have been published that evaluate how fMRI methods are reported based on the 2008 guidelines, but they did not focus on how task based fMRI results are reported. This review updates reporting practices of fMRI methods, and adds an extra focus on how fMRI results are reported. We discuss reporting practices about the design stage, specific participant characteristics, scanner characteristics, data processing methods, data analysis methods and reported results.

Functional connectivity hemispheric contrast (FC-HC): A new metric for language mapping	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						fMRI; Language mapping; Resting state fMRI; Epilepsy	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ATYPICAL LANGUAGE; TASK ACTIVATION; NETWORKS; FMRI; LATERALIZATION; PREDICTS; REORGANIZATION	Development of a task-free method for presurgical mapping of language function is important for use in young or cognitively impaired patients. Resting state connectivity fMRI (RS-fMRI) is a task-free method that may be used to identify cognitive networks. We developed a voxelwise RS-fMRI metric, Functional Connectivity Hemispheric Contrast (FC-HC), to map the language network and determine language laterality through comparison of withinhemispheric language network connections (Integration) to cross-hemispheric connections (Segregation). For the first time, we demonstrated robustness and efficacy of a RS-fMRI metric to map language networks across five groups (total N = 243) that differed in MRI scanning parameters, fMRI scanning protocols, age, and development (typical vs pediatric epilepsy). The resting state FC-HC maps for the healthy pediatric and adult groups showed higher values in the left hemisphere, and had high agreement with standard task language fMRI; in contrast, the epilepsy patient group map was bilateral. FC-HC has strong but not perfect agreement with task fMRI and thus, may reflect related and complementary information about language plasticity and compensation.

Purpose A systematic pipeline was developed to combine tractography reconstruction of language fiber bundles, based on anatomical landmarks (Anatomical-T), with language fMRI cortical activations. A fMRI-targeted Tractography (fMRI-T) was thus obtained, depicting the subsets of the anatomical tracts whose endpoints are located inside a fMRI activation. We hypothesized that fMRI-T could provide additional functional information regarding the subcortical structures, better reflecting the eloquent white matter structures identified intraoperatively. Methods Both Anatomical-T and fMRI-T of language fiber tracts were performed on 16 controls and preoperatively on 16 patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, using a q-ball residual bootstrap algorithm based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) datasets (b = 3000 s/mm(2); 60 directions); fMRI ROIs were obtained using picture naming, verbal fluency, and auditory verb generation tasks. In healthy controls, normalized MNI atlases of fMRI-T and Anatomical-T were obtained. In patients, the surgical resection of the tumor was pursued by identifying eloquent structures with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping and extending surgery to the functional boundaries. Post-surgical MRI allowed to identify Anatomical-T and fMRI-T non-eloquent portions removed during the procedure. Results MNI Atlases showed that fMRI-T is a subset of Anatomical-T, and that different task-specific fMRI-T involve both shared subsets and task-specific subsets - e.g., verbal fluency fMRI-T strongly involves dorsal frontal tracts, consistently with the phonogical-articulatory features of this task. A quantitative analysis in patients revealed that Anatomical-T removed portions of AF-SLF and IFOF were significantly greater than verbal fluency fMRI-T ones, suggesting that fMRI-T is a more specific approach. In addition, qualitative analyses showed that fMRI-T AF-SLF and IFOF predict the exact functional limits of resection with increased specificity when compared to Anatomical-T counterparts, especially the superior frontal portion of IFOF, in a subcohort of patients. Conclusion These results suggest that performing fMRI-T in addition to the 'classic' Anatomical-T may be useful in a preoperative setting to identify the 'high-risk subsets' that should be spared during the surgical procedure.

J	Pur, DR; Eagleson, R; Lo, M; Jurkiewicz, MT; Andrade, A; de Ribaupierre, S				Pur, Daiana R.; Eagleson, Roy; Lo, Marcus; Jurkiewicz, Michael T.; Andrade, Andrea; de Ribaupierre, Sandrine			Presurgical brain mapping of the language network in pediatric patients with epilepsy using resting-state fMRI	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						language mapping; resting-state fMRI; resting-state functional MRI; pediatric epilepsy; presurgical planning; language lateralization		OBJECTIVE Epilepsy affects neural processing and often causes infra- or interhemispheric language reorganization, rendering localization solely based on anatomical landmarks (e.g., Broca's area) unreliable. Preoperative brain mapping is necessary to weigh the risk of resection with the risk of postoperative deficit. However, the use of conventional mapping methods (e.g., somatosensory stimulation, task-based functional MRI [fMRI]) in pediatric patients is technically difficult due to low compliance and their unique neurophysiology. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), a "task-free" technique based on the neural activity of the brain at rest, has the potential to overcome these limitations. The authors hypothesized that language networks can be identified from rs-fMRI by applying functional connectivity analyses. METHODS Cases in which both task-based fMRI and rs-fMRI were acquired as part of the preoperative clinical protocol for epilepsy surgery were reviewed. Task-based fMRI consisted of 2 language tasks and 1 motor task. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired while the patients watched an animated movie and were analyzed using independent component analysis (i.e., data-driven method). The authors extracted language networks from rs-fMRI data by performing a similarity analysis with functionally defined language network templates via a template-matching procedure. The Dice coefficient was used to quantify the overlap. RESULTS Thirteen children underwent conventional task-based fMRI (e.g., verb generation, object naming), rs-fMRI, and structural imaging at 1.5T. The language components with the highest overlap with the language templates were identified for each patient. Language lateralization results from task-based fMRI and rs-fMRI mapping were comparable, with good concordance in most cases. Resting-state fMRI-derived language maps indicated that language was on the left in 4 patients (31%), on the right in 5 patients (38%), and bilateral in 4 patients (31%). In some cases, rs-fMRI indicated a more extensive language representation. CONCLUSIONS Resting-state fMRI-derived language network data were identified at the patient level using a template-matching method. More than half of the patients in this study presented with atypical language lateralization, emphasizing the need for mapping. Overall, these data suggest that this technique may be used to preoperatively identify language networks in pediatric patients. It may also optimize presurgical planning of electrode placement and thereby guide the surgeon's approach to the epileptogenic zone.

However, little has been done to characterize the basic fMRI signal alterations caused by focal epilepsy. Here, we characterize how mTLE affects the fMRI signal in epileptic foci and networks. Resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI were collected from 47 unilateral mTLE patients and 96 healthy controls. FMRI activity, quantified by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, was increased in the epileptic focus and connected regions in mTLE. Evidence for spread of this epileptic fMRI activity was found through linear relationships of regional activity across subjects, the association of these relationships with functional connectivity, and increased activity along white matter tracts. These fMRI activity increases were found to be dependent on the epileptic focus, where the activity was related to disease severity, suggesting the focus to be the origin of these pathological alterations. Furthermore, we found fMRI activity decreases in the default mode network of right mTLE patients with different properties than the activity increases found in the epileptic focus. This work provides insights into basic fMRI signal alterations and their potential spread across networks in focal epilepsy.	[Sainburg, Lucas E.; Johnson, Graham W.; Gonzalez, Hernan F.

Given the vascular origin of the fMRI signal, it remains challenging to separate the neural correlates of global rs-fMRI signal fluctuations from other confounding sources. However, the slow-oscillation detected from individual vessels by single-vessel fMRI presents strong correlation to neural oscillations. Here, we use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the future temporal evolution of the rs-fMRI slow oscillation from both rodent and human brains. The RNNs trained with vessel-specific rs-fMRI signals encode the unique brain oscillatory dynamic feature, presenting more effective prediction than the conventional autoregressive model. This RNN-based predictive modeling of rs-fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) reveals brain state-specific characteristics, demonstrating an inverse relationship between the global rs-fMRI signal fluctuation with the internal default-mode network (DMN) correlation. The RNN prediction method presents a unique data-driven encoding scheme to specify potential brain state differences based on the global fMRI signal fluctuation, but not solely dependent on the global variance.

Linking cortical circuit models to human cognition with laminar fMRI	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Article						Cortical layers; Laminar fMRI; Cortical circuit models; Human brain function; Cognition	CONCURRENT FUNCTIONAL PERFUSION; HUMAN BRAIN; FRONTAL-CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; OCULAR DOMINANCE; TIME-COURSE; MRI; LAYERS	Laboratory animal research has provided significant knowledge into the function of cortical circuits at the laminar level, which has yet to be fully leveraged towards insights about human brain function on a similar spatiotemporal scale. The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with neural models provides new opportunities to gain important insights from current knowledge. During the last five years, human studies have demonstrated the value of high-resolution fMRI to study laminar-specific activity in the human brain. This is mostly performed at ultra-high-field strengths (>= 7 T) and is known as laminar fMRI. Advancements in laminar fMRI are beginning to open new possibilities for studying questions in basic cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, we first review recent methodological advances in laminar fMRI and describe recent human laminar fMRI studies. Then, we discuss how the use of laminar fMRI can help bridge the gap between cortical circuit models and human cognition.

The most popular approach for high-resolution fMRI is currently gradient-echo (GE) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. However, its spatial accuracy is reduced due to its sensitivity to draining vessels, including pial veins, whereas spin-echo (SE) BOLD signal is expected to have higher spatial accuracy, albeit with lower sensitivity than the GE-BOLD signal. Here, we introduce a new double spin-echo (dSE) echo-planar imaging (EPI) method to improve the sensitivity of SE-BOLD contrast by averaging two spin-echoes using three radiofrequency pulses. Human fMRI experiments were performed with slices perpendicular to the central sulcus between motor and sensory cortices at 7 T during fist-clenching with touching. First, we evaluated the feasibility of single-shot dSE-EPI for BOLD fMRI with 1.5 mm isotropic resolution and found that dSE-BOLD fMRI has higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), temporal SNR (tSNR), and higher functional sensitivity than conventional SE-BOLD fMRI. Second, to investigate the laminar specificity of dSE-BOLD fMRI, we implemented a multi-shot approach to achieve 0.8-mm isotropic resolution with sliding-window reconstruction. Unlike GE-BOLD fMRI, the cortical profile of dSE-BOLD fMRI peaked at similar to 1.0 mm from the surface of the primary motor and sensory cortices, demonstrating an improvement of laminar specificity in humans over GE-BOLD fMRI. The proposed multi-shot dSE-EPI method is viable for high spatial resolution UHF-fMRI studies in the pursuit of resolving mesoscopic functional units.

J	Heugel, N; Beardsley, SA; Liebenthal, E				Heugel, Nicholas; Beardsley, Scott A.; Liebenthal, Einat			EEG and fMRI coupling and decoupling based on joint independent component analysis (jICA)	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						FMRI; EEG; Event-Related Potentials (ERPs); Joint Independent Component Analysis (jICA); Auditory Processing; Speech; Spoken Syllables	AUDITORY-CORTEX; N1 WAVE; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; FRONTAL COMPONENTS; BOLD RESPONSE; NORMAL BRAIN; STIMULUS; HABITUATION; SIGNAL; ERP	Background: Meaningful integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) requires knowing whether these measurements reflect the activity of the same neural sources, i.e., estimating the degree of coupling and decoupling between the neuroimaging modalities. New method: This paper proposes a method to quantify the coupling and decoupling of fMRI and EEG signals based on the mixing matrix produced by joint independent component analysis (jICA). The method is termed fMRI/EEG-jICA. Results: fMRI and EEG acquired during a syllable detection task with variable syllable presentation rates (0.25-3 Hz) were separated with jICA into two spatiotemporally distinct components, a primary component that increased nonlinearly in amplitude with syllable presentation rate, putatively reflecting an obligatory auditory response, and a secondary component that declined nonlinearly with syllable presentation rate, putatively reflecting an auditory attention orienting response. The two EEG subcomponents were of similar amplitude, but the secondary fMRI subcomponent was ten folds smaller than the primary one. Comparison to existing method: FMRI multiple regression analysis yielded a map more consistent with the primary than secondary fMRI subcomponent of jICA, as determined by a greater area under the curve (0.5 versus 0.38) in a sensitivity and specificity analysis of spatial overlap. Conclusion: fMRI/EEG-jICA revealed spatiotemporally distinct brain networks with greater sensitivity than fMRI multiple regression analysis, demonstrating how this method can be used for leveraging EEG signals to inform the detection and functional characterization of fMRI signals. fMRI/EEG-jICA may be useful for studying neurovascular coupling at a macro-level, e.g., in neurovascular disorders.

It still lacks a direct comparison of basic task-fMRI and rs-fMRI results between the Wistar rats and SD rats under different anesthetic regimens.Methods: Two rat strains and different time points were adopted to investigate task-fMRI activation and rs-fMRI functional connectivity (FC) results under three kinds of anesthetic regimens (2-2.5% isoflurane only, dexmedetomidine bolus combined with a continuous infusion, and dexmedetomidine bolus combined with 0.3-0.5% isoflurane). The electrical forepaw stimulation method and seed-based FC results were used to compare the task-fMRI brain activation and rs-fMRI FC patterns between the two rat strains.Results: The results showed that Wistar rats had more robust brain activation in task fMRI experiments while exhibiting a less specific interhemispheric FC than that of SD rats under the two dexmedetomidine anesthetic regimens. Moreover, even low-level isoflurane could significantly affect task-fMRI and rs-fMRI results in both rat strains.Conclusions: SD and Wistar rats showed different brain activations and interhemispheric FC patterns under the two dexmedetomidine anesthetic regimens. These results may serve as reference information for small-animal fMRI studies. Impact statementOur study demonstrates different stimulation-induced blood oxygen level-dependent responses and functional connectivity patterns between Sprague Dawley rats and Wistar rats under three anesthetics. This study provides some reference results for different anesthetics' effects on different rat strains in different functional magnetic resonance imaging modalities.

Comparing the test-retest reliability of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging metrics across single band and multiband acquisitions in the context of healthy aging	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						connectivity; fMRI; multiband fMRI; reliability; resting-state	NOISE CORRECTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; CHILDREN; EPI	The identification of meaningful functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) biomarkers requires measures that reliably capture brain performance across different subjects and over multiple scanning sessions. Recent developments in fMRI acquisition, such as the introduction of multiband (MB) protocols and in-plane acceleration, allow for increased scanning speed and improved temporal resolution. However, they may also lead to reduced temporal signal to noise ratio and increased signal leakage between simultaneously excited slices. These methods have been adopted in several scanning modalities including diffusion weighted imaging and fMRI. To our knowledge, no study has formally compared the reliability of the same resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) metrics (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; seed-to-voxel and region of interest [ROI]-to-ROI connectivity) across conventional single-band fMRI and different MB acquisitions, with and without in-plane acceleration, across three sessions. In this study, 24 healthy older adults were scanned over three visits, on weeks 0, 1, and 4, and, on each occasion, underwent a conventional single band rs-fMRI scan and three different rs-fMRI scans with MB factors 4 and 6, with and without in-plane acceleration. Across all three rs-fMRI metrics, the reliability scores were highest with MB factor 4 with no in-plane acceleration for cortical areas and with conventional single band for subcortical areas. Recommendations for future research studies are discussed.	[Cahart, Marie-Stephanie; O'Daly, Owen; Giampietro, Vincent; Zelaya, Fernando; Williams, Steven C.

Prediction of Fuhrman grade of renal clear cell carcinoma by multimodal MRI radiomics: a retrospective study	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							DIFFERENTIATION; CANCER; MASSES	AIM: To explore the value of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics combined with traditional radiologist-defined semantic characteristics and conventional (cMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) texture features in predicting Fuhrman grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 89 patients with histopathologically proven ccRCC (low-grade, 54; high-grade, 35) were collected. Texture features were extracted from cMRI (T1-and T2-weighted imaging) and fMRI (Dixon-MRI; blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD]-MRI; and susceptibility-weighted imaging [SWI]) images, and the traditional characteristics (TC) were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop models based on TC, cMRI, and fMRI texture features for grading. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and leave-group-out cross-validation (LGOCV) were performed to test the reliability of combined models. RESULTS: Two T2-weighted imaging-based, two Dixon_W-based, one Dixon_F-based, one BOLD-based, and three SWI-based texture features, and three TC were extracted for feature selection. TC, cMRI, fMRI, cMRI+fMRI, cMRI+TC, fMRI+TC, and cMRI+fMRI+TC models were constructed. The AUC of the cMRI+fMRI+TC model for differentiating high-from low-grade ccRCC was 0.74, with 81.42% accuracy, 75.93% sensitivity, and 91.43% specificity. The fMRI+TC model exhibited a performance similar to that of the cMRI+fMRI+TC model (p>0.05). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the fMRI+TC and cMRI+fMRI+TC models were significantly higher than those of the other five models (all p<0.05). For the cMRI+fMRI+TC model, the mean accuracy was 85.40% after 100 LGOCV for the test sets. CONCLUSION: Multimodal MRI radiomics combined with TC, cMRI, and fMRI texture features may be a reliable quantitative approach for differentiating high-grade ccRCC from low-grade ccRCC.

Recommended Resting-State fMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing Steps for Preoperative Mapping of Language and Motor and Visual Areas in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Brain Tumors and Epilepsy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GLOBAL SIGNAL; HEAD MOTION; EYES-OPEN; MRI; NOISE; RELIABILITY; IMPACT; TASK; BOLD	Resting-state (rs) fMRI has been shown to be useful for preoperative mapping of functional areas in patients with brain tumors and epilepsy. However, its lack of standardization limits its widespread use and hinders multicenter collaboration. The American Society of Functional Neuroradiology, American Society of Pediatric Neuroradiology, and the American Society of Neuroradiology Functional and Diffusion MR Imaging Study Group recommend specific rs-fMRI acquisition approaches and preprocessing steps that will further support rs-fMRI for future clinical use. A task force with expertise in fMRI from multiple institutions provided recommendations on the rs-fMRI steps needed for mapping of language, motor, and visual areas in adult and pediatric patients with brain tumor and epilepsy. These were based on an extensive literature review and expert consensus. Following rs-fMRI acquisition parameters are recommended: minimum 6-minute acquisition time; scan with eyes open with fixation; obtain rs-fMRI before both task-based fMRI and contrast administration; temporal resolution of <= 2 seconds; scanner field strength of 3T or higher. The following rs-fMRI preprocessing steps and parameters are recommended: motion correction (seed-based correlation analysis [SBC], independent component analysis [ICA]); despiking (SBC); volume censoring (SBC, ICA); nuisance regression of CSF and white matter signals (SBC); head motion regression (SBC, ICA); bandpass filtering (SBC, ICA); and spatial smoothing with a kernel size that is twice the effective voxel size (SBC, ICA).The consensus recommendations put forth for rs-fMRI acquisition and preprocessing steps will aid in standardization of practice and guide rs-fMRI program development across institutions. Standardized rs-fMRI protocols and processing pipelines are essential for multicenter trials and to implement rs-fMRI as part of standard clinical practice.	[Kumar, V.

Ictal fMRI: Mapping Seizure Topography with Rhythmic BOLD Oscillations	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						seizure; fMRI; status epilepticus		Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown elevations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with, but insensitive for, seizure. Rather than evaluating absolute BOLD signal elevations, assessing rhythmic oscillations in the BOLD signal with fMRI may improve the accuracy of seizure mapping. We report a case of a patient with non-convulsive, right hemispheric seizures who underwent fMRI. Unbiased processing methods revealed a map of rhythmically oscillating BOLD signal over the cortical region affected by seizure, and synchronous BOLD signal in the contralateral cerebellum. High-resolution fMRI may help identify the spatial topography of seizure and provide insights into seizure physiology.

The Role of Cerebrovascular-Reactivity Mapping in Functional MRI: Calibrated fMRI and Resting-State fMRI	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						calibrated BOLD; neurovascular coupling; cerebrovascular reactivity; resting-state fMRI; functional connectivity		Task and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is primarily based on the same blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) phenomenon that MRI-based cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) mapping has most commonly relied upon. This technique is finding an ever-increasing role in neuroscience and clinical research as well as treatment planning. The estimation of CVR has unique applications in and associations with fMRI. In particular, CVR estimation is part of a family of techniques called calibrated BOLD fMRI, the purpose of which is to allow the mapping of cerebral oxidative metabolism (CMRO2) using a combination of BOLD and cerebral-blood flow (CBF) measurements. Moreover, CVR has recently been shown to be a major source of vascular bias in computing resting-state functional connectivity, in much the same way that it is used to neutralize the vascular contribution in calibrated fMRI. Furthermore, due to the obvious challenges in estimating CVR using gas challenges, a rapidly growing field of study is the estimation of CVR without any form of challenge, including the use of resting-state fMRI for that purpose. This review addresses all of these aspects in which CVR interacts with fMRI and the role of CVR in calibrated fMRI, provides an overview of the physiological biases and assumptions underlying hypercapnia-based CVR and calibrated fMRI, and provides a view into the future of non-invasive CVR measurement.

Concurrent electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) signals can be used to uncover the nature of brain activities during sleep. However, analyzing simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data is extremely time consuming and experience dependent. Thus, we developed a pipeline, which we named A-PASS, to automatically analyze simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data for studying brain activities during sleep. Approach. A deep learning model was trained on a sleep EEG-fMRI dataset from 45 subjects and used to perform sleep stage scoring. Various fMRI indices can be calculated with A-PASS to depict the neurophysiological characteristics across different sleep stages. We tested the performance of A-PASS on an independent sleep EEG-fMRI dataset from 28 subjects. Statistical maps regarding the main effect of sleep stages and differences between each pair of stages of fMRI indices were generated and compared using both A-PASS and manual processing methods. Main results. The deep learning model implemented in A-PASS achieved both an accuracy and F1-score higher than 70% for sleep stage classification on EEG data acquired during fMRI scanning. The statistical maps generated from A-PASS largely resembled those produced from manually scored stages plus a combination of multiple software programs. Significance. A-PASS allowed efficient EEG-fMRI data processing without manual operation and could serve as a reliable and powerful tool for simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies on sleep.

This study was carried out to determine: 1) how often fMRI adds to prediction of motor risks beyond expert neuroradiological review, 2) success rates of presurgical resting and task-based sensorimotor mapping, and 3) the impact of accelerated resting fMRI acquisitions on network detectability. Methods Data were collected at 2 centers from 71 patients with a primary brain tumor (31 women; mean age 41.9 +/- 13.9 years) and 14 healthy individuals (6 women; mean age 37.9 +/- 12.7 years). Preoperative 3T MRI included anatomical scans and resting fMRI using unaccelerated (TR=3.5 s), intermediate (TR=1.56 s) or high temporal resolution (TR=0.72 s) sequences. Task fMRI finger tapping data were acquired in 45 patients. Group differences in fMRI reproducibility, spatial overlap and success frequencies were assessed with t-tests and chi(2)-tests. Results Radiological review identified the central sulcus in 98.6% (70/71) patients. Task-fMRI succeeded in 100% (45/45). Resting fMRI failed to identify a sensorimotor network in up to 10 patients; it succeeded in 97.9% (47/48) of accelerated fMRIs, compared to only 60.9% (14/23) of unaccelerated fMRIs ( chi (2) = 17.84, p < 0.001). Of the patients 12 experienced postoperative deterioration, largely predicted by anatomical proximity to the central sulcus. Conclusion The use of fMRI in patients with residual or intact presurgical motor function added value to uncertain anatomical localization in just a single peri-Rolandic glioma case. Resting fMRI showed high correspondence to task localization when acquired with accelerated sequences but offered limited success at standard acquisitions.

However, the influence and recognition of multiple tasks are core issues in the Motor Imagery (MI) system. Methods: First, we design the unilateral upper limb MI experimental paradigm and acquire asynchronous functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalogram based on MI (MI-EEG) data. Then, Brain activation areas for each task are statistically analyzed by fMRI data. A novel fMRI-weighted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to reassign each channel's weight based on brain activation areas to improve classification accuracy. Finally, the EEG data is classified by the fMRI-weighted CNN. Results: The four classes of MI tasks reflect significant activation in brain motor areas. The average classification accuracy of fMRI-weighted CNN is 47.0%. The visualization results show the similarity between fMRI and EEG activation areas in the same task. Conclusions: The distinguishability of multiple tasks and the influence on motor areas of the brain are confirmed by fMRI experiments. The classification accuracy of multitasks is improved according to the fMRI-weighted CNN. This paper provides a reference for further research into asynchronous fMRI-EEG modeling and multitask MI classification.

Identification of the Language Network from Resting-State fMRI in Patients with Brain Tumors: How Accurate Are Experts?	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article								BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state fMRI helps identify neural networks in presurgical patients who may be limited in their ability to undergo task-fMRI. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of identifying the language network from resting-state-fMRI independent component analysis (ICA) maps.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through retrospective analysis, patients who underwent both resting-state-fMRI and task-fMRI were compared by identifying the language network from the resting-state-fMRI data by 3 reviewers. Blinded to task-fMRI maps, these investigators independently reviewed resting-state-fMRI ICA maps to potentially identify the language network. Reviewers ranked up to 3 top choices for the candidate resting-state-fMRI language map. We evaluated associations between the probability of correct identification of the language network and some potential factors.RESULTS: Patients included 29 men and 14 women with a mean age of 41 years. Reviewer 1 (with 17 years' experience) demonstrated the highest overall accuracy with 72%; reviewers 2 and 3 (with 2 and 7 years' experience, respectively) had a similar percentage of correct responses (50% and 55%). The highest accuracy used ICA50 and the top 3 choices (81%, 65%, and 60% for reviewers 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The lowest accuracy used ICA50, limiting each reviewer to the top choice (58%, 35%, and 42%).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate variability in the accuracy of blinded identification of resting-state-fMRI language networks across reviewers with different years of experience.

J	Sadraee, A; Paulus, M; Ekhtiari, H				Sadraee, Alaleh; Paulus, Martin; Ekhtiari, Hamed			fMRI as an outcome measure in clinical trials: A systematic review in clinicaltrials.gov	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Review						biomarker; clinical trial; Clinicaltrials; gov; fMRI; RDoC		Introduction More than one-thousand trials with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as an outcome measure were registered in clinicaltrials.gov at the time of writing this article. However, 93% of these registered trials are still not completed with published results and there is no picture available about methodological dimensions of these ongoing trials with fMRI as an outcome measure. Methods We collected trials that use fMRI as an outcome measure in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry on 13 October 2018 and reviewed each trial's record entry. Eligible trials' characteristics were extracted and summarized. Results In total, 1,386 clinical trials were identified that reported fMRI in their outcome measures with fMRI as the only primary outcome in 33% of them. 82% of fMRI trials were started after 2011. The most frequent intervention was drug (pharmacological intervention) (29%). 57% of trials had parallel assignment design and 20% were designed for cross-over assignment. For task-based fMRI, cognitive systems (46%) based on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) was the most frequent domain of tasks. Less than one-third of trials (28%) registered at least one region of interest for their analysis. Food cue reactivity task, pain perception task, n-back task, and monetary incentive delay task were recruited in more than 25 registered trials. Conclusion The number of fMRI trials (fMRI as an outcome measure) with both task and rest protocols is growing rapidly. Our study suggests a growing need for harmonization and standardized checklists on both methods and analysis for preregistration of fMRI-based outcomes in clinical trials.

For example, widespread hemodynamic fluctuations across the brain have been found to correlate with natural, low-frequency variations in the depth and rate of breathing over time. Acquiring peripheral measures of respiration during fMRI scanning not only allows for modeling such effects in fMRI analysis, but also provides valuable information for interrogating brain-body physiology. However, physiological recordings are frequently unavailable or have insufficient quality. Here, we propose a computational technique for reconstructing continuous low-frequency respiration volume (RV) fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We evaluate the performance of this approach across different fMRI preprocessing strategies. Further, we demonstrate that the predicted RV signals can account for similar patterns of temporal variation in resting-state fMRI data compared to measured RV fluctuations. These findings indicate that fluctuations in respiration volume can be extracted from fMRI alone, in the common scenario of missing or corrupted respiration recordings. The results have implications for enriching a large volume of existing fMRI datasets through retrospective addition of respiratory variations information.

By administering TMS concurrently with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the effect of cortical TMS on activity in distant cortical and subcortical structures can be quantified by varying the levels of TMS output intensity. However, TMS generates significant fluctuations in the fMRI time series, and their complex interaction warrants caution before interpreting findings. We present the methodological challenges of concurrent TMS-fMRI and a guide to minimize induced artifacts in experimental design and post-processing. Our study targeted two frontal-striatal circuits: primary motor cortex (M1) projections to the putamen and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to the caudate in healthy human participants. We found that TMS parametrically increased the BOLD signal in the targeted region and subcortical projections as a function of stimulation intensity. Together, this work provides practical steps to overcome common challenges with concurrent TMS-fMRI and demonstrates how TMS-fMRI can be used to investigate functional brain networks.

These have been found to be associated with different cognitive and pathological states, with potential as disease biomarkers, but their neuronal underpinnings remain a matter of debate. A number of recurrent microstates have also been identified in resting-state EEG studies, which are thought to represent the quasi-simultaneous activity of large-scale functional networks reflecting time-varying brain states. Here, we hypothesized that fMRI-derived dFC states may be associated with these EEG microstates. To test this hypothesis, we quantitatively assessed the ability of EEG microstates to predict concurrent fMRI dFC states in simultaneous EEG-fMRI data collected from healthy subjects at rest. By training a random forests classifier, we found that the four canonical EEG microstates predicted fMRI dFC states with an accuracy of 90%, clearly outperforming alternative EEG features such as spectral power. Our results indicate that EEG microstates analysis yields robust signatures of fMRI dFC states, providing evidence of the electrophysiological underpinnings of dFC while also further supporting that EEG microstates reflect the dynamics of large-scale brain networks.

Several successful machine learning algorithms have been proposed in literature to extract valuable knowledge from fMRI. One of these algorithms is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that competent with high capabilities for learning optimal abstractions of fMRI. This is because the CNN learns features similarly to human brain where it preserves local structure and avoids distortion of the global feature space. Focusing on the achievements of using the CNN for the fMRI, and accordingly, the Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DCAE) benefits from the datadriven approach with CNN's optimal features to strengthen the fMRI classification. In this paper, a new two consequent multi-layers DCAE deep discriminative approach for classifying fMRI Images is proposed. The first DCAE is unsupervised sub-model that is composed of four CNN. It focuses on learning weights to utilize discriminative characteristics of the extracted features for robust reconstruction of fMRI with lower dimensional considering tiny details and refining by its deep multiple layers. Then the second DCAE is a supervised sub-model that focuses on training labels to reach an outperformed results. The proposed approach proved its effectiveness and improved literately reported results on a large brain disorder fMRI dataset.

However, there is no standardized method for monkey fMRI data analysis, specifically for data preprocessing. The preprocessing of monkey fMRI data is challenged by several technical and experimental specificities of the monkey research such as artifacts related to body movements or to intracranial leads. Here we propose to address these challenges by developing a new versatile pipeline for macaque fMRI preprocessing. We developed a Python module, Pypreclin, to process raw images using state of the art algorithms embedded in a fully automatic pipeline. To evaluate its robustness, we applied Pypreclin to fMRI data acquired at 3T in both awake and anesthetized macaques, with or without iron oxide contrast agent, using single loop or multichannel phased-array coils, combined or not with intracranial implanted electrodes. We performed both resting-state and auditory evoked fMRI and compared the results of Pypreclin to a previously employed preprocessing pipeline. Pypreclin successfully achieved the registration of the fMRI data to the macaque brain template in all the experimental conditions. Moreover, Pypreclin enables more accurate locations of auditory evoked activations in relation to the gray matter at corrected level in the awake fMRI condition. Finally, using the Primate neuroimaging Data-Exchange open access platform, we could further validate Pypreclin for monkey fMRI images that were acquired a ultra-high fields, from other institutions and using different protocols. Pypreclin is a validated preprocessing tool that adapts to diverse experimental and technical situations of monkey fMRI. Pypreclin code is available on open source data sharing platform.

In population graph-based disease analysis, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success. However, these achievements are inseparable from abundant labeled data and sensitive to spurious signals. To improve fMRI representation learning and classification under a label-efficient setting, we propose a novel and theory-driven self-supervised learning (SSL) framework on GCNs, namely Graph CCA for Temporal sElf-supervised learning on fMRI analysis (GATE). Concretely, it is demanding to design a suitable and effective SSL strategy to extract formation and robust features for fMRI. To this end, we investigate several new graph augmentation strategies from fMRI dynamic functional connectives (FC) for SSL training. Further, we leverage canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) on different temporal embeddings and present the theoretical implications. Consequently, this yields a novel two-step GCN learning procedure comprised of (i) SSL on an unlabeled fMRI population graph and (ii) fine-tuning on a small labeled fMRI dataset for a classification task. Our method is tested on two independent fMRI datasets, demonstrating superior performance on autism and dementia diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/LarryUESTC/GATE.

It has become an increasingly popular method for presurgical mapping, as an alternative to task-based functional MRI wherein the subject performs a task while being scanned. However, there is no commonly acknowledged gold standard approach for detecting eloquent brain areas using rs-fMRI data in clinical settings. In this study, a general linear model-based machine learning (GLM-ML) approach was tested to predict individual motor task activation based on rs-fMRI data. Its accuracy was then compared to a conventional independent component analysis (ICA) approach. 47 healthy subjects were scanned using resting state, active and passive motor task fMRI experiments using a clinically applicable low-resolution fMRI protocol. The model was trained to associate rs-fMRI network maps with that of hand movement task fMRI, then used to predict task activation maps for unseen subjects solely based on their rs-fMRI data. Our results showed that the GLM-ML approach can accurately predict individual differences in task activation using rs-fMRI data and outperform conventional ICA to detect task activation in the primary sensorimotor region. Furthermore, the predicted activation maps using the GLM -ML model matched well with the activation of passive hand movement fMRI on an individual basis. These results suggest that GLM-ML approach can robustly predict individual differences of task activation based on conventional low-resolution rs-fMRI data and has important implications for future clinical applications.

Therefore, the two modalities are now integrated into a hybrid tool, EEG-fMRI, which encapsulates the useful properties of the two. Among other benefits, EEG-fMRI can contribute to a better understanding of brain connectivity and networks. This review lays its focus on the methodologies applied in performing EEG-fMRI studies, namely techniques used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner, artifact removal, and statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. We will investigate simultaneous resting-state and task-based EEG-fMRI studies and discuss their clinical and technological perspectives. Moreover, it is established that the brain regions affected by a task-based neural activity might not be limited to the regions in which they have been initiated. Advanced methods can help reveal the regions responsible for or affected by a developed neural network. Therefore, we have also looked into studies related to characterization of structure and dynamics of brain networks. The reviewed literature suggests that EEG-fMRI can provide valuable complementary information about brain neural networks and functions.

Nonetheless, it is unclear how the networks that are more associated with primary functions, such as the sensory-motor, medial/lateral visual and auditory networks, contribute to clinical assessment. In this study, we examined the rs-fMRI lower-order networks alongside their structural MRI data to clarify the corresponding association with clinical assessment. We studied 109 chronic patients with DoC and emerged from DoC with structural MRI and rs-fMRI: 65 in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness state (VS/UWS), 34 in minimally conscious state (MCS) and 10 with severe disability. rs-fMRI data were analyzed with independent component analyses and seed-based analyses, in relation to structural MRI and clinical data. The results showed that VS/UWS had fewer networks than MCS patients and the rs-fMRI activity in each network was decreased. Visual networks were correlated to the clinical status, and in cases where no clinical response occurred, rs-fMRI indicated distinctive networks conveying information in a similar way to other techniques. The information provided by single networks was limited, whereas the four networks together yielded better classification results, particularly when the model included rs-fMRI and structural MRI data (AUC = 0.80). Both quantitative and qualitative rs-fMRI analyses yielded converging results; vascular etiology might confound the results, and disease duration generally reduced the number of networks observed. The lower-order rs-fMRI networks could be used clinically to support and corroborate visual function assessments in DoC.

However, the episodic retrieval pattern detected by functional MRI (fMRI) appears preserved in aMCI subjects. To address this discrepancy, simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI recording was employed to determine whether temporal dynamics of brain episodic retrieval activity were disturbed in patients with aMCI. Twenty-six aMCI and 29 healthy control (HC) subjects completed a word-list memory retrieval task during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. The retrieval success activation pattern was detected with fMRI analysis, and the familiarity- and recollection-related components of episodic retrieval activity were identified using event-related potential (ERP) analysis. The fMRI-constrained ERP analysis explored the temporal dynamics of brain activity in the retrieval success pattern, and the ERP-informed fMRI analysis detected fMRI correlates of the ERP components related to familiarity and recollection processes. The two groups exhibited similar retrieval success patterns in the bilateral posteromedial parietal cortex, the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). The fMRI-constrained ERP analysis showed that the aMCI group did not exhibit old/ new effects in the IPL and LPFC that were observed in the HC group. In addition, the aMCI group showed disturbed fMRI correlate of ERP recollection component that was associated with inferior EM performance. Therefore, in this study, we identified disturbed temporal dynamics in episodic retrieval activity with a preserved spatial activity pattern in aMCI. Taken together, the simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique demonstrated the potential to identify individuals with a high risk of cognitive deterioration.

Here, we developed a multislice line-scanning fMRI (MS-LS) method to detect laminar fMRI signals in adjacent cortical regions with high spatial (50 mu m) and temporal resolution (100 ms) in anesthetized rats. Across different trials, we detected either laminar-specific positive or negative blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the surrounding cortical region adjacent to the most activated cortex under the evoked condition. Specifically, in contrast to typical Layer (L) 4 correlation across different regions due to the thalamocortical projections for trials with positive BOLD, a strong correlation pattern specific in L2/3 was detected for trials with negative BOLD in adjacent regions, which indicated brain state-dependent laminar-fMRI responses based on corticocortical interaction. Also, in resting-state (rs-) fMRI study, robust lag time differences in L2/3, 4, and 5 across multiple cortices represented the low-frequency rs-fMRI signal propagation from caudal to rostral slices. In summary, our study provided a unique laminar fMRI mapping scheme to better characterize trial-specific intra- and inter-laminar functional connectivity in evoked and resting-state MS-LS.

Due to small dimensions and animal physiology preclinical fMRI is prone to artifacts that may lead to misinterpretation of the data. To reach unbiased translational conclusions, it is, therefore, crucial to identify potential sources of experimental noise and to develop correction methods for contributions that cannot be avoided such as physiological noise. Aim of this study was to assess origin and prevalence of hemodynamic oscillations (HDO) in preclinical fMRI in rat, as well as their impact on data analysis. MethodsFollowing the development of algorithms for HDO detection and suppression, HDO prevalence in fMRI measurements was investigated for different anesthetic regimens, comprising isoflurane and medetomidine, and for both gradient echo and spin echo fMRI sequences. In addition to assessing the effect of vasodilation on HDO, it was studied if HDO have a direct neuronal correlate using local field potential (LFP) recordings. Finally, the impact of HDO on analysis of fMRI data was assessed, studying both the impact on calculation of activation maps as well as the impact on brain network analysis. Overall, 303 fMRI measurements and 32 LFP recordings were performed in 71 rats. ResultsIn total, 62% of the fMRI measurements showed HDO with a frequency of (0.20 +/- 0.02) Hz. This frequent occurrence indicated that HDO cannot be generally neglected in fMRI experiments. Using the developed algorithms, HDO were detected with a specificity of 95%, and removed efficiently from the signal time courses. HDO occurred brain-wide under vasoconstrictive conditions in both small and large blood vessels. Vasodilation immediately interrupted HDO, which, however, returned within 1 h under vasoconstrictive conditions. No direct neuronal correlate of HDO was observed in LFP recordings. HDO significantly impacted analysis of fMRI data, leading to altered cluster sizes and F-values for activated voxels, as well as altered brain networks, when comparing data with and without HDO. DiscussionWe therefore conclude that HDO are caused by vasomotion under certain anesthetic conditions and should be corrected during fMRI data analysis to avoid bias.

J	Ji, JZ; Liu, JD; Han, L; Wang, FP				Ji, Junzhong; Liu, Jinduo; Han, Lu; Wang, Feipeng			Estimating Effective Connectivity by Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Time series analysis; Generators; Data models; Brain modeling; Logic gates; Mathematical model; Effective connectivity; generative adversarial networks; recurrent neural networks; fMRI time series	FMRI; SEARCH	Estimating effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series data has become a very hot topic in neuroinformatics and brain informatics. However, it is hard for the current methods to accurately estimate the effective connectivity due to the high noise and small sample size of fMRI data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for estimating effective connectivity based on recurrent generative adversarial networks, called EC-RGAN. The proposed framework employs the generator that consists of a set of effective connectivity generators based on recurrent neural networks to generate the fMRI time series of each brain region, and uses the discriminator to distinguish between the joint distributions of the real and generated fMRI time series. When the model is well-trained and generated fMRI data is similar to real fMRI data, EC-RGAN outputs the effective connectivity by means of the causal parameters of the effective connectivity generators. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world fMRI time series data demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.

J	Voets, NL; Bartsch, AJ; Plaha, P				Voets, Natalie L.; Bartsch, Andreas J.; Plaha, Puneet			Functional MRI applications for intra-axial brain tumours: uses and nuances in surgical practise	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Review						fMRI; tumour; glioma; metastasis; neurosurgery	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; WADA TEST; AWAKE CRANIOTOMY; LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; INTRAOPERATIVE SEIZURES; RESECTION; FMRI; SPEECH; GLIOMA	Purpose Functional MRI (fMRI) has well-established uses to inform risks and plan maximally safe approaches in neurosurgery. In the field of brain tumour surgery, however, fMRI is currently in a state of clinical equipoise due to debate around both its sensitivity and specificity. Materials and methods In this review, we summarise the role and our experience of fMRI in neurosurgery for gliomas and metastases. We discuss nuances in the conduct and interpretation of fMRI that, based on our practise, most directly impact fMRI's usefulness in the neurosurgical setting. Results Illustrated examples in which fMRI in our hands directly influences the neurosurgical treatment of brain tumours include evaluating the probability and nature of functional risks, especially for language functions. These presurgical risk assessments, in turn, help to predict the resectability of tumours, select or deselect patients for awake surgery, indicate the need for neurophysiological monitoring and guide the optimal use of intra-operative stimulation mapping. A further emerging application of fMRI is in measuring functional adaptation of functional networks after (partial) surgery, of potential use in the timing of further surgery. Conclusions In appropriately selected patients with a clearly defined surgical question, fMRI offers a valuable complementary tool in the pre-surgical evaluation of brain tumours. However, there is a great need for standards in the administration and analysis of fMRI as much as in the techniques that it is commonly evaluated against. Surprisingly little data exists that evaluates the accuracy of fMRI not just against complementary methods, but in terms of its ultimate clinical aim of minimising post-surgical morbidity.

However, the causal contribution of regional brain activity to whole-brain fMRI network organization remains unclear. Here we combine neural manipulations, resting-state fMRI and in vivo electrophysiology to probe how inactivation of a cortical node causally affects brain-wide fMRI coupling in the mouse. We find that chronic inhibition of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) via overexpression of a potassium channel increases fMRI connectivity between the inhibited area and its direct thalamo-cortical targets. Acute chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC produces analogous patterns of fMRI overconnectivity. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we find that chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC enhances low frequency (0.1-4 Hz) oscillatory power via suppression of neural firing not phase-locked to slow rhythms, resulting in increased slow and delta band coherence between areas that exhibit fMRI overconnectivity. These results provide causal evidence that cortical inactivation can counterintuitively increase fMRI connectivity via enhanced, less-localized slow oscillatory processes. Pathological perturbation affects whole brain network activity. Here the authors show in mice that cortical inactivation unexpectedly results in increased fMRI connectivity between the manipulated regions and its direct axonal targets.

In the human brain, regional brain entropy (BEN) has been increasingly assessed using resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), while changes of regional BEN during task-based fMRI have been scarcely studied. The purpose of this study is to characterize task-induced regional BEN alterations using the large Human Connectome Project (HCP) data. To control the potential modulation by the block design, BEN of task-fMRI was calculated from the fMRI images acquired during the task conditions only (task BEN) and then compared to BEN of rs-fMRI (resting BEN). Moreover, BEN was separately calculated from the control blocks of the task-fMRI runs (control BEN) and compared to task BEN. Finally, control BEN was compared to resting BEN to test for residual task effects in the control condition. With respect to resting state, task performance unanimously induced BEN reduction in the peripheral cortical area and BEN increase in the centric part of the sensorimotor and perception networks. Control compared to resting BEN showed similar entropy alterations, suggesting large residual task effects. Task compared to control BEN was characterized by reduced entropy in occipital, orbitofrontal, and parietal regions. Brain entropy (BEN) represents a unique method to characterize brain activity at rest and during task performance. In this study, we compare BEN estimated during resting state, task performance, and fixation blocks of task-fMRI.

The methods for fMRI QC vary in different fMRI preprocessing pipelines. The inflating sample size and number of scanning sites for fMRI studies further add to the difficulty and working load of the QC procedure. Therefore, as a constituent part of the Demonstrating Quality Control Procedures in fMRI research topic in Frontiers, we preprocessed a well-organized open-available dataset using DPABI pipelines to illustrate the QC procedure in DPABI. Six categories of DPABI-derived reports were used to eliminate images without adequate quality. After the QC procedure, twelve participants (8.6%) were categorized as excluded and eight participants (5.8%) were categorized as uncertain. More automatic QC tools were needed in the big-data era while visually inspecting images was still indispensable now.

Functional neuroimaging as a catalyst for integrated neuroscience	NATURE			English	Review							HUMAN BRAIN; SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FMRI SIGNALS; CONNECTIVITY; STATE; NETWORKS; DRIVEN; REPRESENTATIONS	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive access to the awake, behaving human brain. By tracking whole-brain signals across a diverse range of cognitive and behavioural states or mapping differences associated with specific traits or clinical conditions, fMRI has advanced our understanding of brain function and its links to both normal and atypical behaviour. Despite this headway, progress in human cognitive neuroscience that uses fMRI has been relatively isolated from rapid advances in other subdomains of neuroscience, which themselves are also somewhat siloed from one another. In this Perspective, we argue that fMRI is well-placed to integrate the diverse subfields of systems, cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience. We first summarize the strengths and weaknesses of fMRI as an imaging tool, then highlight examples of studies that have successfully used fMRI in each subdomain of neuroscience. We then provide a roadmap for the future advances that will be needed to realize this integrative vision. In this way, we hope to demonstrate how fMRI can help usher in a new era of interdisciplinary coherence in neuroscience. This Perspective reviews successful applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and presents a case for fMRI as a central hub on which to integrate the dispersed subfields of systems, cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience.

Emerging studies have combined fMRI with fiber optic-based optogenetics to decipher circuit-specific neuromodulation from meso to macroscales. High-resolution fMRI is needed to integrate hemodynamic responses into cross-scale functional dynamics, but the SNR remains a limiting factor given the complex implantation setup of animal brains. Here, we developed a multimodal fMRI imaging platform with an implanted inductive coil detector. This detector boosts the tSNR of MRI images, showing a 2-3-fold sensitivity gain over conventional coil configuration. In contrast to the cryoprobe or array coils with limited spaces for implanted brain interface, this setup offers a unique advantage to study brain circuit connectivity with optogenetic stimulation and can be further extended to other multimodal fMRI mapping schemes.

Facilitating open-science with realistic fMRI simulation: validation and application	PEERJ			English	Article						fMRI; Simulation; Multivariate design; Reproducibility; Power analysis	PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; DEFAULT MODE; SAMPLE-SIZE; MRI; DESIGNS; RATES	With advances in methods for collecting and analyzing fMRI data, there is a concurrent need to understand how to reliably evaluate and optimally use these methods. Simulations of fMRI data can aid in both the evaluation of complex designs and the analysis of data. We present fmrisim, a new Python package for standardized, realistic simulation of fMRI data. This package is part of BrainIAK: a recently released open-source Python toolbox for advanced neuroimaging analyses. We describe how to use fmrisim to extract noise properties from real fMRI data and then create a synthetic dataset with matched noise properties and a user-specified signal. We validate the noise generated by fmrisim to show that it can approximate the noise properties of real data. We further show how fmrisim can help researchers find the optimal design in terms of power. The fmrisim package holds promise for improving the design of fMRI experiments, which may facilitate both the pre-registration of such experiments as well as the analysis of fMRI data.

We report fMRI and nTMS language-mapping results in 19 pediatric-epilepsy patients and compare those to definitive testing by electrical cortical stimulation, Wada test, and/or neuropsychological testing. Most discordant results occurred when fMRI found right-hemispheric language. In those cases, when nTMS showed left-hemispheric or bilateral language representation, left-hemispheric language was confirmed by definitive testing. Therefore, we propose nTMS should be considered for pediatric presurgical language-mapping when fMRI shows right-hemispheric language, with nTMS results superseding fMRI results in those scenarios.

High-resolution relaxometry-based calibrated fMRI in murine brain: Metabolic differences between awake and anesthetized states	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Awake mice; anesthesia; dexmedetomidine; calibrated fMRI; CMRO2; TRUST; pCASL	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; OXYGEN-METABOLISM; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BOLD; DEXMEDETOMIDINE; MRI; VOLUME; OPTIMIZATION; HYPERCAPNIA	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques using the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal have shown great potential as clinical biomarkers of disease. Thus, using these techniques in preclinical rodent models is an urgent need. Calibrated fMRI is a promising technique that can provide high-resolution mapping of cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2). However, calibrated fMRI is difficult to use in rodent models for several reasons: rodents are anesthetized, stimulation-induced changes are small, and gas challenges induce noisy CMRO2 predictions. We used, in mice, a relaxometry-based calibrated fMRI method which uses cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the BOLD-sensitive magnetic relaxation component, R-2 ', the same parameter derived in the deoxyhemoglobin-dilution model of calibrated fMRI. This method does not use any gas challenges, which we tested on mice in both awake and anesthetized states. As anesthesia induces a whole-brain change, our protocol allowed us to overcome the former limitations of rodent studies using calibrated fMRI. We revealed 1.5-2 times higher CMRO2, dependent upon brain region, in the awake state versus the anesthetized state. Our results agree with alternative measurements of whole-brain CMRO2 in the same mice and previous human anesthesia studies. The use of calibrated fMRI in rodents has much potential for preclinical fMRI.

Here we describe an analysis method that provides data-driven estimates of these effects in task-based fMRI. The method involves fitting a one-dimensional manifold that characterizes variation in response timecourses observed in a given dataset, and then using identified early and late timecourses as basis functions for decomposing responses into components related to the microvasculature (capillaries and small venules) and the macrovasculature (large veins), respectively. We show the removal of late components substantially reduces the superficial cortical depth bias of fMRI responses and helps eliminate artifacts in cortical activity maps. This method provides insight into the origins of the fMRI signal and can be used to improve the spatial accuracy of fMRI. Temporal decomposition through manifold fitting (TDM) is an analysis technique that decomposes blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in task-based fMRI into different components that likely correspond to microvasculature- and macrovasculature-driven signals.

Age-related differences in fMRI subsequent memory effects are directly linked to local grey matter volume differences	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						FMRI; MRI; Memory; Aging; Multimodal neuroimaging; Grey -matter volume	BRAIN ACTIVITY; DECLINE	Episodic memory performance declines with increasing age, and older adults typically show reduced activation of inferior temporo-parietal cortices in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of episodic memory formation. Given the age-related cortical volume loss, it is conceivable that age-related reduction of memory-related fMRI activity may be partially attributable to reduced grey matter volume (GMV). We performed a voxel-wise multimodal neuroimaging analysis of fMRI correlates of successful memory encoding, using regional GMV as covariate. In a large cohort of healthy adults (106 young, 111 older), older adults showed reduced GMV across the entire neocortex and reduced encoding-related activation of inferior temporal and parieto-occipital cortices compared to young adults. Importantly, these reduced fMRI activations during successful encoding could in part be attributed to lower regional GMV. Our results highlight the importance of controlling for structural MRI differences in fMRI studies in older adults but also demonstrate that age-related differences in memory-related fMRI activity cannot be attributed to structural variability alone.

Denoising brain networks using a fixed mathematical phase change in independent component analysis of magnitude-only fMRI data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						fMRI; independent component analysis; denoising; mathematical spatial source phase; mapping framework; fixed phase change	GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL; FUNCTIONAL MRI DATA; BLIND SEPARATION; IMAGING DATA; COMPLEX; ACTIVATION; SUBJECT; ICA; DECOMPOSITION; INFORMATION	Brain networks extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) from magnitude-only fMRI data are usually denoised using various amplitude-based thresholds. By contrast, spatial source phase (SSP) or the phase information of ICA brain networks extracted from complex-valued fMRI data, has provided a simple yet effective way to perform the denoising using a fixed phase change. In this work, we extend the approach to magnitude-only fMRI data to avoid testing various amplitude thresholds for denoising magnitude maps extracted by ICA, as most studies do not save the complex-valued data. The main idea is to generate a mathematical SSP map for a magnitude map using a mapping framework, and the mapping framework is built using complex-valued fMRI data with a known SSP map. Here we leverage the fact that the phase map derived from phase fMRI data has similar phase information to the SSP map. After verifying the use of the magnitude data of complex-valued fMRI, this framework is generalized to work with magnitude-only data, allowing use of our approach even without the availability of the corresponding phase fMRI datasets. We test the proposed method using both simulated and experimental fMRI data including complex-valued data from University of New Mexico and magnitude-only data from Human Connectome Project. The results provide evidence that the mathematical SSP denoising with a fixed phase change is effective for denoising spatial maps from magnitude-only fMRI data in terms of retaining more BOLD-related activity and fewer unwanted voxels, compared with amplitude-based thresholding. The proposed method provides a unified and efficient SSP approach to denoise ICA brain networks in fMRI data.

However, due to the lack of sufficient data and the high dimensionality of brain volume, deep learning models of fMRI tend to suffer from overfitting. In addition, existing methods rarely studied fMRI data augmentation and its application. To address these issues, we developed a VAE-GAN framework that combined a VAE (variational auto-encoder) with a GAN (generative adversarial net) for functional brain network identification and fMRI augmentation. As a generative model, the VAE-GAN models the distribution of fMRI so that it enables the extraction of more generalized features, and thus relieve the overfitting issue. The VAE-GAN is easier to train on fMRI than a standard GAN since it uses latent variables from VAE to generate fake data rather than relying on random noise that is used in a GAN, and it can generate higher quality of fake data than VAE since the discriminator can promote the training of the generator. In other words, the VAE-GAN inherits the advantages of VAE and GAN and avoids their limitations in modeling of fMRI data. Extensive experiments on task fMRI datasets from HCP have proved the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed VAE-GAN framework for identifying both temporal features and functional brain networks compared with existing models, and the quality of fake data is higher than those from VAE and GAN. The results on resting state fMRI of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)200 dataset further demonstrated that the fake data generated by the VAE-GAN can help improve the performance of brain network modeling and ADHD classification.

However, there is a growing interest in its temporal sensitivity. This is despite the temporal blurring of neuronal events by the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, the peak of which lags neuronal firing by 4-6 seconds. Given this, the goal of this review is to answer a seemingly simple question - "What are the benefits of increased temporal sampling for fMRI?". To answer this, we have combined fMRI data collected at multiple temporal scales, from 323 to 1000 milliseconds, with a review of both historical and contemporary temporal literature. After a brief discussion of technological developments that have rekindled interest in temporal research, we next consider the potential statistical and methodological benefits. Most importantly, we explore how fast fMRI can uncover previously unobserved neuro-temporal dynamics - effects that are entirely missed when sampling at conventional 1 to 2 second rates. With the intrinsic link between space and time in fMRI, this temporal renaissance also delivers improvements in spatial precision.

BAYESIAN INFERENCE FOR BRAIN ACTIVITY FROM FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING COLLECTED AT TWO SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						&nbsp; Imaging statistics; Gaussian process; Bayesian nonparametrics; data integration; presurgical fMRI	FMRI; MODELS; MRI; VISUALIZATION; ALIGNMENT	Neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons increasingly opt to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map functionally relevant brain re-gions for noninvasive presurgical planning and intraoperative neuronaviga-tion. This application requires a high degree of spatial accuracy, but the fMRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases as spatial resolution increases. In prac-tice, fMRI scans can be collected at multiple spatial resolutions, and it is of interest to make more accurate inference on brain activity by combining data with different resolutions. To this end, we develop a new Bayesian model to leverage both better anatomical precision in high resolution fMRI and higher SNR in standard resolution fMRI. We assign a Gaussian process prior to the mean intensity function and develop an efficient, scalable posterior compu-tation algorithm to integrate both sources of data. We draw posterior sam-ples using an algorithm analogous to Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in an expanded parameter space. We illustrate our method in analysis of presurgical fMRI data and show in simulation that it infers the mean in-tensity more accurately than alternatives that use either the high or standard resolution fMRI data alone.

However, reconstructing dynamic natural vision remains a challenge because of the limitation of the temporal resolution of fMRI. Here, we developed a novel fMRI-conditional video generative adversarial network (f-CVGAN) to reconstruct rapid video stimuli from evoked fMRI responses. In this model, we employed a generator to produce spatiotemporal reconstructions and employed two separate discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators) for the assessment. We trained and tested the f-CVGAN on two publicly available video-fMRI datasets, and the model produced pixel-level reconstructions of 8 perceived video frames from each fMRI volume. Experimental results showed that the reconstructed videos were fMRI-related and captured important spatial and temporal information of the original stimuli. Moreover, we visualized the cortical importance map and found that the visual cortex is extensively involved in the reconstruction, whereas the low-level visual areas (V1/V2/V3/V4) showed the largest contribution. Our work suggests that slow blood oxygen level-dependent signals describe neural representations of the fast perceptual process that can be decoded in practice.

Visual Field Reconstruction Using fMRI-Based Techniques	TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						visual field mapping; receptive field; fMRI; computational modeling; glaucoma	STANDARD AUTOMATED PERIMETRY; CORTEX; REORGANIZATION; STIMULUS; MAPS	Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based techniques to assess the integrity of the visual field (VF). Methods: We combined 3T fMRI and neurocomputational models, that is, conventional population receptive field (pRF) mapping and a new advanced pRF framework "microprobing" (MP), to reconstruct the VF representations of different cortical areas. To demonstrate their scope, both approaches were applied in healthy participants with simulated scotomas and participants with glaucoma. For the latter group we compared the VFs obtained with standard automated perimetry (SAP) and via fMRI. Results: Using SS, we found that the fMRI-based techniques can detect absolute defects in VFs that are larger than 3 degrees, in single participants, based on 12 minutes of fMRI scan time. Moreover, we found that the MP approach results in a less biased estimation of the preserved VF. In participants with glaucoma, we found that fMRI-based VF reconstruction detected VF defects with a correspondence to SAP that was decent, reflected by the positive correlation between fMRI-based sampling density and SAP-based contrast sensitivity loss (SAP) r(2) = 0.44, P = 0.0002.This correlation was higher for MP compared to that for the conventional pRF analysis. Conclusions: The fMRI-based reconstruction of the VF enables the evaluation of vision loss and provides useful details on the properties of the visual cortex. Translational Relevance: The fMRI-based VF reconstruction provides an objective alternative to detect VF defects. It may either complement SAP or could provide VF information in patients unable to perform SAP.

The novel approach of using concurrent tES-fMRI to modulate and measure targeted brain activity/connectivity may provide unique insights into the causal interactions between the brain neural responses and psychiatric/neurologic signs and symptoms, and importantly, guide the development of new treatments. However, tES stimulation parameters to optimally influence the underlying brain activity may vary with respect to phase difference, frequency, intensity, and electrode's montage among individuals. Here, we propose a protocol for closed-loop tES-fMRI to optimize the frequency and phase difference of alternating current stimulation (tACS) for two nodes (frontal and parietal regions) in individual participants. We carefully considered the challenges in an online optimization of tES parameters with concurrent fMRI, specifically in its safety, artifact in fMRI image quality, online evaluation of the tES effect, and parameter optimization method, and we designed the protocol to run an effective study to enhance frontoparietal connectivity and working memory performance with the optimized tACS using closed-loop tES-fMRI. We provide technical details of the protocol, including electrode types, electrolytes, electrode montages, concurrent tES-fMRI hardware, online fMRI processing pipelines, and the optimization algorithm. We confirmed the implementation of this protocol worked successfully with a pilot experiment.

However, compared to the more commonly used rat fMRI, it is challenging for mouse fMRI to obtain robust and specific functional imaging results. In the meantime, in other neuroscience modalities such as optical imaging, functional recording in the awake mice is common and becoming standard. Therefore, in the current study we developed comprehensive setups and analysis pipeline for multi-sensory fMRI paradigms in the awake mice. Customized setups of somatosensory (whisker), auditory and olfactory stimulation were developed for use in the cryogenic coil in the awake mouse fMRI setting. After carefully evaluating head motion and motion artefacts, the nuisance regression approach was optimized for reducing the confounding effect of motion. The high temporal resolution data (TR = 0.35 s) revealed fast temporal dynamics (time-to-peak similar to 2 s) of evoked BOLD responses in most brain regions. Using the derived awake mouse specific hemodynamic response functions, high spatial resolution data revealed robust, specific and consistent cortical and subcortical activations in response to somatosensory, auditory and olfactory stimulations, respectively. Overall, we present comprehensive methods for acquiring and analyzing sensory evoked awake mouse fMRI data. The establishment of multi-sensory paradigms in awake mouse fMRI provides valuable tools for examining spatiotemporal characteristics and neural mechanisms of BOLD signals in the future.

The 2017 American Academy of Neurology practice guidelines on the use of pre-surgical cognitive fMRI suggests that verbal memory fMRI could be used to lateralize memory functions in people with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and should be used to predict post-operative verbal memory outcome. There are however technical and methodological considerations, to optimize both the sensitivity and specificity of this imaging modality. Below we discuss these constraints and suggest recommendations to consider when designing a memory fMRI paradigm.

A biomarker for AP-R is currently unavailable. We reviewed the evidence for the hypothesis that functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (fMRI-FC) is a predictor of AP-R or could serve as a biomarker for AP-R in psychosis. Method: A systematic review of longitudinal fMRI studies examining the predictive performance and relationship between FC and AP-R was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Technical and clinical aspects were critically assessed for the retrieved studies. We addressed three questions: Q1) is baseline fMRI-FC related to subsequent AP-R; Q2) is AP-R related to a change in fMRI-FC; and Q3) can baseline fMRI-FC predict subsequent AP-R? Results: In total, 28 articles were included. Most studies were of good quality. fMRI-FC analysis pipelines included seed-based-, independent component- / canonical correlation analysis, network-based statistics, and graph-theoretical approaches. We found high heterogeneity in methodological approaches and results. For Q1 (N = 17) and Q2 (N = 18), the most consistent evidence was found for FC between the striatum and ventral attention network as a potential biomarker of AP-R. For Q3 (N = 9) accuracy's varied form 50 till 93%, and prediction models were based on FC between various brain regions. Conclusion: The current fMRI-FC literature on AP-R is hampered by heterogeneity of methodological approaches. Methodological uniformity and further improvement of the reliability and validity of fMRI connectivity analysis is needed before fMRI-FC analysis can have a place in clinical applications of antipsychotic treatment.

Here, T2prep BOLD fMRI was evaluated in an event-related paradigm for the first time. Functional experiments were performed using gradient-echo (GRE) EPI, spin-echo (SE) EPI, and T2prep BOLD fMRI during an event-related visual task in 10 healthy human subjects. Each fMRI method was performed with a low (3.4 x 3.4 x 4 mm(3)) and a high (1.5 mm isotropic) spatial resolution on 3T and a high resolution (1.5 mm isotropic) on 7T. Robust activation were detected in the visual cortex with all three fMRI methods. In each group of fMRI scans (3T low resolution, 3T high resolution, and 7T high resolution), GRE EPI showed the highest signal change (Delta S/S), largest full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and longest time-to-peak (TTP) extracted from the hemodynamic response functions (HRF), indicating substantial signal contribution from large draining veins which have longer response times than microvessels. In contrast, T2prep BOLD showed the lowest Delta S/S, smallest FWHM, and shortest TTP, suggesting that T2prep BOLD may have a purer T2-weighted BOLD contrast that is more sensitive to microvessels compared to GRE/SE EPI BOLD. This trend was more obvious in fMRI scans performed with a lower spatial resolution on a lower field (3T with a 3.4 x 3.4 x 4 mm(3) voxel). Scan-rescan reproducibility in the same subjects was comparable among the three fMRI methods. The results from the current study are expected to be useful to establish T2prep BOLD as a useful alternative fMRI approach for event-related fMRI in brain regions with large susceptibility artifacts.

The present study builds on this work using latest methods from the field of financial mathematics to model fMRI noise volatility. Methods: Multi-echo phantom and human fMRI scans were used and realised volatility was estimated. The Hurst parameter H is an element of (0, 1), which governs the roughness/irregularity of realised volatility time series, was estimated. Calibration of H was performed pathwise, using well-established neural network calibration tools. Results: In all experiments the volatility calibrated to values within the rough case, H < 0.5, and on average fMRI noise was very rough with 0.03 < H < 0.05. Some edge effects were also observed, whereby H was larger near the edges of the phantoms. Discussion: The findings suggest that fMRI volatility is not only non-constant, but also substantially more irregular than a standard Brownian motion. Thus, further research is needed to examine the impact such pronounced oscillations in the volatility of fMRI noise have on data analyses.

Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL) framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets, without requiring labeled training data. This model is further fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks. Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.

Layer-dependent functional connectivity methods	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						7T fMRI; layer-fMRI; Functional connectivity; Mesoscopic fMRI; Human connectome; Laminar fMRI; Whole brain submillimeter fMRI; VASO; CBV-fMRI	CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RESTING-STATE FMRI; HUMAN BRAIN; SPIN-ECHO; GRADIENT-ECHO; BOLD; RESOLUTION; ACTIVATION; VASO	Recent methodological advances in fMRI contrast and readout strategies have allowed researchers to approach the mesoscopic spatial regime of cortical layers. This has revolutionized the ability to map cortical information processing within and across brain systems. However, until recently, most layer-fMRI studies have been confined to primary cortices using basic block-design tasks and macro-vascular-contaminated sequence contrasts. To become an established method for user-friendly applicability in neuroscience practice, layer-fMRI acquisition and analysis methods need to be extended to more flexible connectivity-based experiment designs; they must be able to capture subtle changes in brain networks of higher-order cognitive areas, and they should not be spatially biased with unwanted vein signals. In this article, we review the most pressing challenges of layer-dependent fMRI for large-scale neuroscientific applicability and describe recently developed acquisition methodologies that can resolve them. In doing so, we review technical tradeoffs and capabilities of modern MR-sequence approaches to achieve measurements that are free of locally unspecific vein signal, with whole-brain coverage, subsecond sampling, high resolutions, and with a combination of those capabilities. The presented approaches provide whole-brain layer-dependent connectivity data that open a new window to investigate brain network connections. We exemplify this by reviewing a number of candidate tools for connectivity analyses that will allow future studies to address new questions in network neuroscience. The considered network analysis tools include: hierarchy mapping, directional connectomics, source-specific connectivity mapping, and network sub-compartmentalization. We conclude: Whole-brain layer-fMRI without large-vessel contamination is applicable for human neuroscience and opens the door to investigate biological mechanisms behind any number of psychological and psychiatric phenomena, such as selective attention, hallucinations and delusions, and even conscious perception.

Artifact Reduction in Simultaneous EEG-fMRI: A Systematic Review of Methods and Contemporary Usage	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						simultaneous EEG-fMRI; artifact; motion; ballistocardiogram; electroencephalography; BOLD	BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM ARTIFACTS; PULSE ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; MOTION; VALIDATION; PUMP	Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a technique that combines temporal (largely from EEG) and spatial (largely from fMRI) indicators of brain dynamics. It is useful for understanding neuronal activity during many different event types, including spontaneous epileptic discharges, the activity of sleep stages, and activity evoked by external stimuli and decision-making tasks. However, EEG recorded during fMRI is subject to imaging, pulse, environment and motion artifact, causing noise many times greater than the neuronal signals of interest. Therefore, artifact removal methods are essential to ensure that artifacts are accurately removed, and EEG of interest is retained. This paper presents a systematic review of methods for artifact reduction in simultaneous EEG-fMRI from literature published since 1998, and an additional systematic review of EEG-fMRI studies published since 2016. The aim of the first review is to distill the literature into clear guidelines for use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI artifact reduction methods, and the aim of the second review is to determine the prevalence of artifact reduction method use in contemporary studies. We find that there are many published artifact reduction techniques available, including hardware, model based, and data-driven methods, but there are few studies published that adequately compare these methods. In contrast, recent EEG-fMRI studies show overwhelming use of just one or two artifact reduction methods based on literature published 15-20 years ago, with newer methods rarely gaining use outside the group that developed them. Surprisingly, almost 15% of EEG-fMRI studies published since 2016 fail to adequately describe the methods of artifact reduction utilized. We recommend minimum standards for reporting artifact reduction techniques in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies and suggest that more needs to be done to make new artifact reduction techniques more accessible for the researchers and clinicians using simultaneous EEG-fMRI.

Jon			Submillimeter fMRI Acquisition Techniques for Detection of Laminar and Columnar Level Brain Activation	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Review						columnar; fMRI; high-resolution; laminar; layer-specific; submillimeter	PARALLEL IMAGING TECHNIQUES; HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; SPIN-ECHO FMRI; OF-VIEW MRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BLOOD-FLOW; 7 T; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; ANALYSIS STRATEGIES; BOLD FMRI	Since the first demonstration in the early 1990s, functional MRI (fMRI) has emerged as one of the most powerful, noninvasive neuroimaging tools to probe brain functions. Subsequently, fMRI techniques have advanced remarkably, enabling the acquisition of functional signals with a submillimeter voxel size. This innovation has opened the possibility of investigating subcortical neural activities with respect to the cortical depths or cortical columns. For this purpose, numerous previous works have endeavored to design suitable functional contrast mechanisms and dedicated imaging techniques. Depending on the choice of the functional contrast, functional signals can be detected with high sensitivity or with improved spatial specificity to the actual activation site, and the pertaining issues have been discussed in a number of earlier works. This review paper primarily aims to provide an overview of the subcortical fMRI techniques that allow the acquisition of functional signals with a submillimeter resolution. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of the imaging techniques will be described and compared. We also summarize supplementary imaging techniques that assist in the analysis of the subcortical brain activation for more accurate mapping with reduced geometric deformation. This review suggests that there is no single universally accepted method as the gold standard for subcortical fMRI. Instead, the functional contrast and the corresponding readout imaging technique should be carefully determined depending on the purpose of the study. Due to the technical limitations of current fMRI techniques, most subcortical fMRI studies have only targeted partial brain regions. As a future prospect, the spatiotemporal resolution of fMRI will be pushed to satisfy the community's need for a deeper understanding of whole-brain functions and the underlying connectivity in order to achieve the ultimate goal of a time-resolved and layer-specific spatial scale.

If this assumption is correct, the presence of vascular steal phenomenon should subsequently result in an equal negative fMRI signal response during a motor-task based BOLD-fMRI study (increase in metabolism without an increase in cerebral blood flow due to exhausted reserve capacity) in otherwise functional brain tissue. To investigate this premise, the aim of this study was to further investigate motor-task based BOLD-fMRI signal responses in brain areas exhibiting negative BOLD-CVR. Material and methods: Seventy-one datasets of patients with cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease without motor defects, who underwent a CO2-calibrated motor task-based BOLD-fMRI study with a fingertapping paradigm and a subsequent BOLD-CVR study with a precisely controlled CO2-challenge during the same MRI examination, were included. We compared BOLD-fMRI signal responses in the bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri - i. e. Region of Interest (ROI) with the corresponding BOLD-CVR in this ROI. The ROI was determined using a second level group analysis of the BOLD-fMRI task study of 42 healthy individuals undergoing the same study protocol. Results: An overall decrease in BOLD-CVR was associated with a decrease in BOLD-fMRI signal response within the ROI. For patients exhibiting negative BOLD-CVR, we found both positive and negative motor-task based BOLD-fMRI signal responses. Conclusion: We show that the presence of negative BOLD-CVR responses to CO2 is associated with heterogeneous motor task-based BOLD-fMRI signal responses, where some patients show -more presumed- negative BOLD-fMRI signal responses, while other patient showed positive BOLD-fMRI signal responses. This finding may indicate that the autoregulatory vasodilatory reserve capacity does not always need to be completely exhausted for vascular steal phenomenon to occur.

It remains challenging to differentiate circuit-specific FC from global regulation. Here, we developed a bilateral line-scanning fMRI method to detect laminar-specific rs-fMRI signals from homologous forepaw somatosensory cortices with high spatial and temporal resolution in rat brains. Based on spectral coherence analysis, two distinct bilateral fluctuation spectral features were identified: ultra-slow fluctuation (<0.04 Hz) across all cortical laminae versus Layer (L) 2/3-specific evoked BOLD at 0.05 Hz based on 4 s on/16 s off block design and resting-state fluctuations at 0.08-0.1 Hz. Based on the measurements of evoked BOLD signal at corpus callosum (CC), this L2/3-specific 0.05 Hz signal is likely associated with neuronal circuit-specific activity driven by the callosal projection, which dampened ultra-slow oscillation less than 0.04 Hz. Also, the rs-fMRI power variability clustering analysis showed that the appearance of L2/3-specific 0.08-0.1 Hz signal fluctuation is independent of the ultra-slow oscillation across different trials. Thus, distinct laminar-specific bilateral FC patterns at different frequency ranges can be identified by the bilateral line-scanning fMRI method.

When selecting voxels by null-hypothesis tests, the conventional analysis may overestimate fMRI response amplitudes related to interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs), especially when IEDs are rare. We aimed to estimate fMRI response amplitudes represented by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) percentage changes related to IEDs using a hierarchical model. It involves the local and distributed hemodynamic response homogeneity to regularize estimations. Bayesian inference was applied to fit the model. Eighty-two epilepsy patients who underwent EEG-fMRI and subsequent surgery were included in this study. A conventional voxel-wise general linear model was compared to the hierarchical model on estimated fMRI response amplitudes and on the concordance between the highest response cluster and the surgical cavity. The voxel-wise model overestimated fMRI responses compared to the hierarchical model, evidenced by a practically and statistically significant difference between the estimated BOLD percentage changes. Only the hierarchical model differentiated brief and long-lasting IEDs with significantly different BOLD percentage changes. Overall, the hierarchical model outperformed the voxel-wise model on presurgical evaluation, measured by higher prediction performance. When compared with a previous study, the hierarchical model showed higher performance metric values, but the same or lower sensitivity. Our results demonstrated the capability of the hierarchical model of providing more physiologically reasonable and more accurate estimations of fMRI response amplitudes induced by IEDs. To enhance the sensitivity of EEG-fMRI for presurgical evaluation, it may be necessary to incorporate more appropriate spatial priors and bespoke decision strategies.

In recent years, the resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) was shown to be a feasible method for preoperative language assessment. The aim of this study was to examine whether language-related resting-state components, which have been obtained using a data-driven independent-component-based identification algorithm, can be supportive in determining language dominance in the left or right hemisphere. Twenty patients suffering from brain lesions close to supposed language-relevant cortical areas were included. RS-fMRI and task-based (TB-fMRI) were performed for the purpose of preoperative language assessment. TB-fMRI included a verb generation task with an appropriate control condition (a syllable switching task) to decompose language-critical and language-supportive processes. Subsequently, the best fitting ICA component for the resting-state language network (RSLN) referential to general linear models (GLMs) of the TB-fMRI (including models with and without linguistic control conditions) was identified using an algorithm based on the Dice index. Thereby, the RSLNs associated with GLMs using a linguistic control condition led to significantly higher laterality indices than GLM baseline contrasts. LIs derived from GLM contrasts with and without control conditions alone did not differ significantly. In general, the results suggest that determining language dominance in the human brain is feasible both with TB-fMRI and RS-fMRI, and in particular, the combination of both approaches yields a higher specificity in preoperative language assessment. Moreover, we can conclude that the choice of the language mapping paradigm is crucial for the mentioned benefits.

A common tool used to investigate neurocognitive ageing is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, although fMRI data are often interpreted in terms of neuronal activity, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured by fMRI includes contributions of both vascular and neuronal factors, which change differentially with age. While some studies investigate vascular ageing factors, the results of these studies are not well known within the field of neurocognitive ageing and therefore vascular confounds in neurocognitive fMRI studies are common. Despite over 10 000 BOLD-fMRI papers on ageing, fewer than 20 have applied techniques to correct for vascular effects. However, neurovascular ageing is not only a confound in fMRI, but an important feature in its own right, to be assessed alongside measures of neuronal ageing. We review current approaches to dissociate neuronal and vascular components of BOLD-fMRI of regional activity and functional connectivity. We highlight emerging evidence that vascular mechanisms in the brain do not simply control blood flow to support the metabolic needs of neurons, but form complex neurovascular interactions that influence neuronal function in health and disease.

Combining findings from multiple fMRI modalities can offer valuable information for characterizing and managing optic neuropathies. In this article, we review a subset of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies of optic neuropathies. We consider glaucoma, acute optic neuritis (ON), discuss traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), and explore consistency between findings from RS and visually driven fMRI studies. Consistent with visually driven studies, glaucoma studies at rest also indicated reduced activation in the visual cortex and dorsal visual stream. RS-fMRI further reported varying levels of functional connectivity in the ventral stream depending on disease severity. ON patients show alterations within the visual cortex in both fMRI techniques. Particularly, higher-than-normal RS activity is observed in the acute phase and decreases as the disease progresses. A similar pattern is observed in the visual cortex of TON-like, open globe injury (OGI), patients. Additionally, visually driven and RS-fMRI studies of ON patients show recovery of brain activity in the visual cortex. RS-fMRI suggests recovery of signals in higher-tier visual areas MT and LOC as well. Finally, RS-fMRI has not yet been applied to TON, although reviewing OGI studies suggests that it is feasible. Future RS-fMRI studies of optic neuropathies could prioritize studying the fine scale RS activity of brain areas that visually driven studies have identified. We suggest that a more systematic longitudinal comparison of optic neuropathies with advanced fMRI would provide improved diagnostic and prognostic information.

Methods Clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging data (T1-weighted and task-based fMRI during silent naming [SN] and object knowledge [OK]) were obtained at baseline, month 8 and month 16 from a 49-year-old lady presenting with anomias and evolving to overt svPPA in 8 months. Results At baseline, the patient showed isolated anomias and mild left anterior temporal pole atrophy. During SN-fMRI, she showed bilateral temporal and left inferior frontal gyri (iFG) activations. During OK-fMRI, we observed normal performance and the recruitment of bilateral posterior hippocampi, iFG and left middle orbitofrontal gyrus (mOFG). At month 8, the patient received a diagnosis of svPPA and showed isolated right iFG activity during SN-fMRI, and a borderline performance during OK-fMRI together with a disappearance of mOFG recruitment. At the last visit (after 7-month language therapy), the patient showed a stabilization of naming disturbances, and, compared to previous visits, an increased left iFG recruitment during SN-fMRI. During OK-fMRI, she performed abnormally and did not show the activity of mOFG and iFG. Across all visits, brain atrophy remained stable. Conclusions This case report showed longitudinal fMRI patterns during semantic-related tasks from prodromal to overt svPPA. Frontal brain recruitment may represent a compensatory mechanism in patients with early svPPA, which is likely to be reinforced by language-therapy. Brain fMRI is more sensitive compared with structural MRI to detect progressive brain changes associated with disease and treatment.

Current source reconstruction is defined as an ill-posed inverse problem, since the number of sensors is less than the number of current sources. One powerful approach to solving this problem is to use functional MRI (fMRI) data as a spatial constraint, although it boosts the cost of measurement and the burden on subjects. Here, we show how to use the meta-analysis fMRI data synthesized from thousands of papers instead of the individually recorded fMRI data. To mitigate the differences between the meta-analysis and individual data, the former are imported as prior information of the hierarchical Bayesian estimation. Using realistic simulations, we found out the performance of current source reconstruction using meta-analysis fMRI data to be better than that using low-quality individual fMRI data and conventional methods. By applying experimental data of a face recognition task, we qualitatively confirmed that group analysis results using the meta-analysis fMRI data showed a tendency similar to the results using the individual fMRI data. Our results indicate that the use of meta-analysis fMRI data improves current source reconstruction without additional measurement costs. We assume the proposed method would have greater effect for modalities with lower measurement costs, such as optically pumped magnetometers.

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of preoperative fMRI and DTI-t obtained with a simultaneous multi-slice technique using intraoperative direct cortical stimulation (DCS) or corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP) as reference standards. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 26 patients (23-74 years; male:female, 13:13) with tumors in the vicinity of Broca's area who underwent preoperative fMRI and DTI-t. A site-by-site comparison between preoperative (fMRI and DTI-t) and intraoperative language mapping (DCS or CCEP) was performed for 226 cortical sites to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI and DTI-t for mapping Broca's areas. For sites with positive signals on fMRI or DTI-t, the true-positive rate (TPR) was calculated based on the concordance and discordance between fMRI and DTI-t. Results: Among 226 cortical sites, DCS was performed in 100 sites and CCEP was performed in 166 sites. The specificities of fMRI and DTI-t ranged from 72.4% (63/87) to 96.8% (122/126), respectively. The sensitivities of fMRI (except for verb generation) and DTI-t were 69.2% (9/13) to 92.3% (12/13) with DCS as the reference standard, and 40.0% (16/40) or lower with CCEP as the reference standard. For sites with preoperative fMRI or DTI-t positivity (n = 82), the TPR was high when fMRI and DTI-t were concordant (81.2% and 100% using DCS and CCEP, respectively, as the reference standards) and low when fMRI and DTI-t were discordant (<= 24.2%). Conclusion: fMRI and DTI-t are sensitive and specific for mapping Broca's area compared with DCS and specific but insensitive compared with CCEP. A site with a positive signal on both fMRI and DTI-t represents a high probability of being an essential language area.

Previous studies have either applied sedatives during scanning or pre-treatment of anesthetics, e.g., isoflurane, to reduce the motion of animals, which could confound the brain function of "awake" states in rodents. Here, we have established a long training awake mouse fMRI-pupillometry paradigm/setup without the initial use of anesthesia. To validate the awake mouse fMRI platform, evoked BOLD-fMRI was performed to identify brain activation in the visual cortex, dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, and superior colliculus. Furthermore, pupil signal fluctuation was investigated during scanning, showing a less dilated pupil after 5-8 weeks of intermittent training. Thus, using the awake mouse fMRI with real-time pupillometry provides a longitudinal functional mapping tool to study fully conscious mice.

When applied to animal studies, anesthesia is always used to reduce the movement of the animal and also reduce the impacts on the results of fMRI. Several awake models have been proposed by applying physical animal movement restrictions. However, restraining devices were designed for individual subject which limits the promotion of fMRI in awake animals. Here, a clinical muscle relaxant rocuronium bromide (RB) was introduced to restrain the animal in fMRI scanning time. The fMRI reactions of the animal induced with RB and the other two commonly used anesthesia protocols were investigated. The results of the fMRI showed that there were increased functional connectivity and well-round visual responses in the RB induced state. Furthermore, significant BOLD signal changes were found in the cortex and thalamus regions when the animal revived from isoflurane, which should be essential to further understand the effects of anesthesia on the brain.

Here, we propose a novel scheme, called Static T2*WI-based Subject-Specific Super Resolution fMRI (STSS-SRfMRI), to enhance the functional resolution, or ability to discriminate spatially adjacent but functionally different responses, of fMRI. The scheme is based on super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SRGAN) that utilize a T2*-weighted image (T2*WI) dataset as a training reference. The efficacy of the scheme was evaluated through comparison with the activation maps obtained from the raw unpreprocessed functional data (raw fMRI). MRI images were acquired from 30 healthy volunteers using a 3 Tesla scanner. The modified SRGAN reconstructs a high-resolution image series from the original low-resolution fMRI data. For quantitative comparison, several metrics were calculated for both the STSS-SRfMRI and the raw fMRI activation maps. The ability to distinguish between two different finger-tapping tasks was significantly higher [p = 0.00466] for the reconstructed STSS-SRfMRI images than for the raw fMRI images. The results indicate that the functional resolution of the STSS-SRfMRI scheme is superior, which suggests that the scheme is a potential solution to realizing higher functional resolution in fMRI images obtained using 3T MRI.

Acquiring sufficient pairs of images and their corresponding fMRI responses, which span the huge space of natural images, is prohibitive. We present a novel self-supervised approach that goes well beyond the scarce paired data, for achieving both: (i) state-of-the art fMRI-to-image reconstruction, and (ii) first-ever large-scale semantic classification from fMRI responses. By imposing cycle consistency between a pair of deep neural networks (from image-to-fMRI & from fMRI-to-image), we train our image reconstruction network on a large number of "unpaired " natural images (images without fMRI recordings) from many novel semantic categories. This enables to adapt our reconstruction network to a very rich semantic coverage without requiring any explicit semantic supervision. Specifically, we find that combining our self-supervised training with high-level perceptual losses , gives rise to new reconstruction & classification capabilities. In particular, this perceptual training enables to classify well fMRIs of never-before-seen semantic classes, without requiring any class labels during training . This gives rise to: (i) Unprecedented image-reconstruction from fMRI of never-before-seen images (evaluated by image metrics and human testing), and (ii) Large-scale semantic classification of categories that were never-before-seen during network training. Such large-scale (1000-way) semantic classification from fMRI recordings has never been demonstrated before . Finally, we provide evidence for the biological consistency of our learned model.

Rs-fMRI however does not provide the ideal environmental setting, as participants are continuously exposed to noise generated by MRI coils during acquisition of Echo Planar Imaging (EPI). We investigated the effect of EPI noise on resting state activity and connectivity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), by reproducing the acoustic characteristics of rs-fMRI environment during the recordings. As compared to fMRI, MEG has little sensitivity to brain activity generated in deep brain structures, but has the advantage to capture both the dynamic of cortical magnetic oscillations with high temporal resolution and the slow magnetic fluctuations highly correlated with BOLD signal. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in a counterbalanced design study including three conditions: a) silent resting state (Silence), b) resting state upon EPI noise (fMRI), and c) resting state upon white noise (White). White noise was employed to test the specificity of fMRI noise effect. The amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) in alpha band measured the connectivity of seven Resting State Networks (RSN) of interest (default mode network, dorsal attention network, language, left and right auditory and left and right sensory-motor). Vigilance dynamic was estimated from power spectral activity. Results: fMRI and White acoustic noise consistently reduced connectivity of cortical networks. The effects were widespread, but noise and network specificities were also present. For fMRI noise, decreased connectivity was found in the right auditory and sensory-motor networks. Progressive increase of slow theta-delta activity related to drowsiness was found in all conditions, but was significantly higher for fMRI. Theta-delta significantly and positively correlated with variations of cortical connectivity. Discussion: rs-fMRI connectivity is biased by unavoidable environmental factors during scanning, which warrant more careful control and improved experimental designs. MEG is free from acoustic noise and allows a sensitive estimation of resting state connectivity in cortical areas. Although underutilized, MEG could overcome issues related to noise during fMRI, in particular when investigation of motor and auditory networks is needed.

Tablet Technology for Writing and Drawing during Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Review	SENSORS			English	Review						fMRI; fMRI compatibility; fMRI equipment; computerized tablet; neuropsychological tests; functional neurosurgery; essential tremor; writing; drawing; kinematics		Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful modality to study brain activity. To approximate naturalistic writing and drawing behaviours inside the scanner, many fMRI-compatible tablet technologies have been developed. The digitizing feature of the tablets also allows examination of behavioural kinematics with greater detail than using paper. With enhanced ecological validity, tablet devices have advanced the fields of neuropsychological tests, neurosurgery, and neurolinguistics. Specifically, tablet devices have been used to adopt many traditional paper-based writing and drawing neuropsychological tests for fMRI. In functional neurosurgery, tablet technologies have enabled intra-operative brain mapping during awake craniotomy in brain tumour patients, as well as quantitative tremor assessment for treatment outcome monitoring.

Pupil diameter changes reflect brain state fluctuations driven by neuromodulatory systems. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been used to identify global patterns of neuronal correlation with pupil diameter changes; however, the linkage between distinct brain state-dependent activation patterns of neuromodulatory nuclei with pupil dynamics remains to be explored. Here, we identified four clusters of trials with unique activity patterns related to pupil diameter changes in anesthetized rat brains. Going beyond the typical rs-fMRI correlation analysis with pupil dynamics, we decomposed spatiotemporal patterns of rs-fMRI with principal component analysis (PCA) and characterized the cluster-specific pupil-fMRI relationships by optimizing the PCA component weighting via decoding methods. This work shows that pupil dynamics are tightly coupled with different neuromodulatory centers in different trials, presenting a novel PCA-based decoding method to study the brain state-dependent pupil-fMRI relationship.

It remains unknown how these multiple network components interact, and it remains unknown how they cause the behavioral, autonomic, and experiential effects of emotions. Here we describe a framework for combining a novel technique, concurrent electrical stimulation with fMRI (es-fMRI), together with a novel analysis, inferring causal structure from fMRI data (causal discovery). We outline a research program for investigating human emotion with these new tools, and provide initial findings from two large resting-state datasets as well as case studies in neurosurgical patients with electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The overarching goal is to use causal discovery methods on fMRI data to infer causal graphical models of how brain regions interact, and then to further constrain these models with direct stimulation of specific brain regions and concurrent fMRI. We conclude by discussing limitations and future extensions. The approach could yield anatomical hypotheses about brain connectivity, motivate rational strategies for treating mood disorders with deep brain stimulation, and could be extended to animal studies that use combined optogenetic fMRI.

However, the relationships between them remain incompletely understood. In the current study, twenty-four subjects (14 males, 10 females) were recruited and investigated the correlation among rGU, rCBF, and BOLD fMRI-derived metrics reflecting the neural activity, including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC) by hybrid PET/fMRI. Correlation analyses were performed across subject and across space at both voxel level and region level, considering partial volume effects by adjusting for gray matter volume. Each pair of metrics showed significant across-space correlations. rGU against ReHo showed the highest mean correlation coefficients. rGU had higher correlations with three resting-state (RS) fMRI metrics than did ASL-rCBF. However, the across-subject correlations were not significant among functional modalities (rGU, rCBF, and RS-fMRI BOLD data) at either voxel level or region level even with a liberal threshold, except for significant across-subject correlation between RS-fMRI metrics (ALFF, ReHo, and DC). These comprehensive findings from hybrid PET/MR might provide complementary information to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the brain activity and open new perspective to interpret pathologic conditions.

Recent years have seen a growing interest in extending this approach to rodents and non-human primates to understand the mechanism of fMRI connectivity and complement human investigations of the functional connectome. Here, we discuss current challenges and opportunities of fMRI connectivity mapping across species. We underscore the critical importance of physiologically decoding neuroimaging measures of brain (dys)connectivity via multiscale mechanistic investigations in animals. We next highlight a set of general principles governing the organization of mammalian connectivity networks across species. These include the presence of evolutionarily conserved network systems, a dominant cortical axis of functional connectivity, and a common repertoire of topographically conserved fMRI spatiotemporal modes. We finally describe emerging approaches allowing comparisons and extrapolations of fMRI connectivity findings across species. As neuroscientists gain access to increasingly sophisticated perturbational, computational and recording tools, cross-species fMRI offers novel opportunities to investigate the large-scale organization of the mammalian brain in health and disease.

While most rt-fMRI NF studies so far have demonstrated the ability of the method to evoke changes in brain activity and improve symptoms of mental disorders, a recently evolving field is network-based functional connectivity (FC) rt-fMRI NF. However, FC rt-fMRI NF has methodological challenges such as respirational artefacts that could potentially bias the training if not controlled. In this randomized, double-blind, yoke-controlled, pre-registered FC rt-fMRI NF study with healthy participants (N = 40) studied over three training days, we tested the feasibility of an FC rt-fMRI NF approach with online global signal regression (GSR) to control for physiological artefacts for up-regulation of connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal network. While our pre-registered null hypothesis significance tests failed to reach criterion, we estimated the FC training effect at a medium effect size at the end of the third training day after rigorous control of physiological artefacts in the offline data. This hints at the potential of FC rt-fMRI NF for the development of innovative transdiagnostic circuit-specific interventional approaches for mental disorders and the effect should now be confirmed in a well-powered study.

Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to diagnose AD has yielded promising results. Most studies assume fixed time lags when constructing functional networks. Since the propagation delays between brain signals are constantly changing, these methods cannot reflect more detailed relationships between brain regions. In this work, we use a deep learning-based Granger causality estimator for brain connectivity construction. It exploits the strength of long short-term memory in ever-changing time series processing. This research involves data analysis from sMRI and rs-fMRI. We use sMRI to analyze the cerebral cortex properties and use rs-fMRI to analyze the graph metrics of functional networks. We extract a small subset of optimal features from both types of data. A support vector machine (SVM) is trained and tested to classify AD (n = 27) from healthy controls (n = 20) using rs-fMRI and sMRI features. Using a subset of optimal features in SVM, we achieve a classification accuracy of 87.23% for sMRI, 78.72% for rs-fMRI, and 91.49% for combined sMRI with rs-fMRI. The results show the potential to identify AD from healthy controls by integrating rs-fMRI and sMRI. The integration of sMRI and rs-fMRI modalities can provide supplemental information to improve the diagnosis of AD relative to either the sMRI or fMRI modalities alone.

FMRI data provide a sequence of whole-brain volumes over time and hence are inherently four dimensional (4D). Missing data in fMRI experiments arise from image acquisition limits, susceptibility and motion artifacts or during confounding noise removal. Hence, significant brain regions may be excluded from the data, which can seriously undermine the quality of subsequent analyses due to the significant number of missing voxels. We take advantage of the four dimensional (4D) nature of fMRI data through a tensor representation and introduce an effective algorithm to estimate missing samples in fMRI data. The proposed Riemannian nonlinear spectral conjugate gradient (RSCG) optimization method uses tensor train (TT) decomposition, which enables compact representations and provides efficient linear algebra operations. Exploiting the Riemannian structure boosts algorithm performance significantly, as evidenced by the comparison of RSCG-TT with state-of-the-art stochastic gradient methods, which are developed in the Euclidean space. We thus provide an effective method for estimating missing brain voxels and, more importantly, clearly show that taking the full 4D structure of fMRI data into account provides important gains when compared with three-dimensional (3D) and the most commonly used two-dimensional (2D) representations of fMRI data.

Imaging the temporal dynamics of brain states with highly sampled fMRI	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; LIGHT SLEEP; FLUCTUATIONS; NETWORK; HIPPOCAMPUS; RESPONSES; CORTEX; MEMORY; REPLAY	The spontaneous dynamics of the brain modulate its function from moment to moment, shaping neural computation and cognition. Functional MRI (fMRI), while classically used as a tool for spatial localization, is increasingly being used to identify the temporal dynamics of brain activity. fMRI analyses focused on the temporal domain have revealed important new information about the dynamics underlying states such as arousal, attention, and sleep. Dense temporal sampling - either by using fast fMRI acquisition, or multiple repeated scan sessions within individuals - can further enrich the information present in these studies. This review focuses on recent developments in using fMRI to identify dynamics across brain states, particularly vigilance and sleep states, and the potential for highly temporally sampled fMRI to answer these questions.

This methodological brief presents the brain-imaging method of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and illustrates its application in neuroentrepreneurship for the first time. In contrast to the traditional task-based fMRI approach, rs-fMRI observes the brain in the absence of cognitive tasks or presentation of stimuli, which offers benefits for improving our understanding of the entrepreneurial mind. Here, we describe the method and provide methodological motivations for performing brain resting-state functional neuroimaging studies on entrepreneurs. In addition, we illustrate the use of seed-based correlation analysis, one of the most common analytical approaches for analyzing rs-fMRI data. In this illustration, we show that habitual entrepreneurs have increased functional connectivity between the insula (a region associated with cognitive flexibility) and the anterior prefrontal cortex (a key region for explorative choice) as compared to managers. This increased connectivity could help promote flexible behavior. Thus in brief, we provide an exemplar of a novel way to expand our understanding of the brain in the domain of entrepreneurship. We discuss possible directions for future research and challenges to be addressed to facilitate the inclusion of re-fMRI studies into neuroentrepreneurship.

Challenges and opportunities of mesoscopic brain mapping with fMRI	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article							CORTEX; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS; SIGNAL; LAYERS	Layer fMRI, requiring high field, advanced pulse sequences, and sophisticated processing methods, has emerged in the last decade. The rate of layer fMRI papers published has grown sharply as more groups are overcoming the substantial technical challenges and the unique advantages are becoming clear. Rather than simple delineation of functional activation, layer fMRI promises to provide directional activity and connectivity measures as they are inferred by the layer-specific location. This short review highlights the methods used to achieve layer fMRI as well as the challenges in acquisition, processing and interpretation. It emphasizes the utility of extensive individual averaging as well as the extreme difficulty of cross subject averaging. It also highlights recent studies that have explored layer fMRI in cognitive tasks as well as resting state connectivity studies that have revealed cortical hierarchy.

Bayesian MEG time courses with fMRI priors	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Brain; Bayesian statistics; Inverse problem; Magnetoencephalography; Functional magnetic Resonance imaging	SPEECH; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; CHILDREN	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) records brain activity with excellent temporal and good spatial resolution, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers good temporal and excellent spatial resolution. The aim of this study is to implement a Bayesian framework to use fMRI data as spatial priors for MEG inverse solutions. We used simulated MEG data with both evoked and induced activity and experimental MEG data from sixteen participants to examine the effectiveness of using fMRI spatial priors in MEG source reconstruction. For simulated MEG data, incorporating the prior information from fMRI increased the spatial resolution of MEG source reconstruction by 3 mm on average. For experimental MEG data, fMRI spatial information reduced the spurious clusters for evoked activity and showed more left-lateralized activation pattern for induced activity. The use of fMRI spatial priors greatly reduced location error for induced source in MEG data. Our results provide empirical evidence that the use of fMRI spatial priors improves the accuracy of MEG source reconstruction. The combined MEG and fMRI approach can provide neuroimaging data with better spatial and temporal resolutions to add another perspective to our understanding of the neurobiology of language. The potential clinical applications include pre-surgical evaluation of language function for epilepsy patients and evaluation of language network for children with language disorders.

The spatial and temporal underpinnings of the fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal and corresponding fNIRS concentration of oxygenated (HbO), deoxygenated (HbR), and total hemoglobin (HbT) measurements are still not completely clear. We aim to analyze the spatial correspondence between these hemodynamic signals, in motor-network regions. To this end, we acquired asynchronous fMRI and fNIRS recordings from 9 healthy participants while performing motor imagery and execution. Using this multimodal approach, we investigated the ability to identify motor-related activation clusters in fMRI data using subject-specific fNIRS-based cortical signals as predictors of interest. Group-level activation was found in fMRI data modeled from corresponding fNIRS measurements, with significant peak activation found overlapping the individually-defined primary and premotor motor cortices, for all chromophores. No statistically significant differences were observed in multimodal spatial correspondence between HbO, HbR, and HbT, for both tasks. This suggests the possibility of translating neuronal information from fMRI into an fNIRS motor-coverage setup with high spatial correspondence using both oxy and deoxyhemoglobin data, with the inherent benefits of translating fMRI paradigms to fNIRS in cognitive and clinical neuroscience.

FMRI Anterior Temporal Epilepsy Su	Prediction of Naming Outcome With FMRI Language Lateralization in Left Temporal Epilepsy Surgery	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							LOBE EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DOMINANCE; DECLINE; WADA; LOBECTOMY; RESECTION; ONSET; RISK	Background and Objectives Naming decline after left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery is common and difficult to predict. Preoperative language fMRI may predict naming decline, but this application is still lacking evidence. We performed a large multicenter cohort study of the effectiveness of fMRI in predicting naming deficits after left TLE surgery. Methods At 10 US epilepsy centers, 81 patients with left TLE were prospectively recruited and given the Boston Naming Test (BNT) before and approximate to 7 months after anterior temporal lobectomy. An fMRI language laterality index (LI) was measured with an auditory semantic decision-tone decision task contrast. Correlations and a multiple regression model were built with a priori chosen predictors. Results Naming decline occurred in 56% of patients and correlated with fMRI LI (r = -0.41, p < 0.001), age at epilepsy onset (r = -0.30, p = 0.006), age at surgery (r = -0.23, p = 0.039), and years of education (r = 0.24, p = 0.032). Preoperative BNT score and duration of epilepsy were not correlated with naming decline. The regression model explained 31% of the variance, with fMRI contributing 14%, with a 96% sensitivity and 44% specificity for predicting meaningful naming decline. Cross-validation resulted in an average prediction error of 6 points. Discussion An fMRI-based regression model predicted naming outcome after left TLE surgery in a large, prospective multicenter sample, with fMRI as the strongest predictor. These results provide evidence supporting the use of preoperative language fMRI to predict language outcome in patients undergoing left TLE surgery. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class I evidence that fMRI language lateralization can help in predicting naming decline after left TLE surgery.

Monitoring the spinal cord activity during SCS with fMRI could provide important and objective measures of integrative responses to treatment. Unfortunately, spinal cord fMRI is severely challenged by motion and susceptibility artifacts induced by the implanted electrode and bones. This pilot study introduces multi-band sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (MB-SWIFT) technique for spinal cord fMRI during SCS in rats. Given the close to zero acquisition delay and high bandwidth in 3 dimensions, MB-SWIFT is demonstrated to be highly tolerant to motion and susceptibility-induced artifacts and thus holds promise for fMRI during SCS. Methods: MB-SWIFT with 0.78 X 0.78 X 1.50 mm(3) spatial resolution and 3-s temporal resolution was used at 9.4 Tesla in rats undergoing epidural SCS at different frequencies. Its performance was compared with spin echo EPI. The origin of the functional contrast was also explored using suppression bands. Results: MB-SWIFT was tolerant to electrode-induced artifacts and respiratory motion, leading to substantially higher fMRI sensitivity than spin echo fMRI. Clear stimulation frequency-dependent responses to SCS were detected in the rat spinal cord close to the stimulation site. The origin of MB-SWIFT fMRI signals was consistent with dominant inflow effects. Conclusion: fMRI of the rat spinal cord during SCS can be consistently achieved with MB-SWIFT, thus providing a valuable experimental framework for assessing the effects of SCS on the central nervous system.

In this study, we combined DREADD technology with fMRI ("chemo-fMRI") to investigate alterations of spontaneous neuronal activity. These were induced by the unilateral activation of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons (D1-neurons) in the mouse dorsal striatum (DS). After clozapine (CLZ) stimulation of the excitatory DREADD expressed in Dl-neurons, the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) increased bilaterally in the medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens and cortex. In addition, we found that the gamma-band of local field potentials was increased in the stimulated DS and cortex bilaterally. These results provide insights for better interpretation of cell type-specific activity changes in fMRI.

The rs-fMRI has easily elucidated rs-fMRI metrics, such as the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and degree centrality (DC). To increase the applicability of these metrics, higher reliability is required by reducing confounders that are not related to the functional connectivity signal. Many previous studies already demonstrated the effects of physiological artifact removal from rs-fMRI data, but few have evaluated the effect on rs-fMRI metrics. In this study, we examined the effect of physiological noise correction on the most common rs-fMRI metrics. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated measurements on parcellated brain areas by applying physiological noise correction based on the RETROICOR method. Then, we evaluated the correction effect for five rs-fMRI metrics for the whole brain: FC, fALFF, ReHo, VMHC, and DC. The correction effect depended not only on the brain region, but also on the metric. Among the five metrics, the reliability in terms of the mean value of all ROIs was significantly improved for FC, but it deteriorated for fALFF, with no significant differences for ReHo, VMHC, and DC. Therefore, the decision on whether to perform the physiological correction should be based on the type of metric used.

Nonetheless, due to the lack of effective and efficient tools for handling high-dimensional and complex fMRI data, this potential has still not been fully explored. A critical issue to be addressed is to identify clinically relevant features from high dimensional fMRI data in a fast and accurate manner. To address this problem, a new quantum-behaved multiverse optimization (QMVO) approach is proposed for fMRI dimensionality reduction and a new prediction approach based on L1-norm sparse coding and adaptive dictionary learning (SCDL) is developed to decode the whole brain fMRI data. QMVO is designed to enhance local search ability, avoid premature convergence, and increase population diversity among individuals. Further, to efficiently re-estimate parameters of the prediction model with new available data, a new SCDL sparse coding is proposed, which requires no training and needs minimal parameters to tune. The proposed QMVO-SCDL model is applied to a pain-evoked fMRI dataset to decode the pain perception level. Results show that QMVO-SCDL can decode pain levels and identify predictive fMRI patterns with high accuracy, high convergence speed, and short consumption time. Moreover, the performance of the proposed model outperforms different recent ML techniques. Therefore, the proposed model has a great promise to be a powerful tool for fMRI decoding.

Re-imagining fMRI for awake behaving infants	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ATTENTION; NOISE	Thousands of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have provided important insight into the human brain. However, only a handful of these studies tested infants while they were awake, because of the significant and unique methodological challenges involved. We report our efforts to address these challenges, with the goal of creating methods for awake infant fMRI that can reveal the inner workings of the developing, preverbal mind. We use these methods to collect and analyze two fMRI datasets obtained from infants during cognitive tasks, released publicly with this paper. In these datasets, we explore and evaluate data quantity and quality, task-evoked activity, and preprocessing decisions. We disseminate these methods by sharing two software packages that integrate infant-friendly cognitive tasks and eye-gaze monitoring with fMRI acquisition and analysis. These resources make fMRI a feasible and accessible technique for cognitive neuroscience in awake and behaving human infants.	[Ellis, C. T.; Skalaban, L. J.; Yates, T. S.; Cordova, N.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging, deep learning, and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING			English	Review						Alzheimer's disease (AD); computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD); deep learning; deep neural networks (DNN); functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)	FMRI; NETWORK; MRI; DEMENTIA	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed using a mixture of psychological tests and clinical observations. However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.

In this review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search on spinal cord fMRI studies and summarized the recent advancements and resulting scientific achievements of spinal cord fMRI in the following three aspects: the current state of spinal cord fMRI methodologies and stimulation protocols, knowledge about the healthy spinal cord's functions obtained via spinal cord fMRI, and fMRI's exemplary usage in spinal cord diseases and injuries. We conclude with a discussion that, while technical challenges exist, novel fMRI technologies for and new knowledge about the healthy human spinal cord have been established. Empowered by these developments, investigations of pathological and injury states within the spinal cord have become the next important direction of spinal cord fMRI. Recent clinical investigations into spinal cord pathologies, for example, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, have already provided deep insights into spinal cord impairments and the time course of impairment-caused changes. We expect that future spinal cord fMRI advancement and research development will further enhance our understanding of various spinal cord diseases and provide the foundation for evaluating existing and developing new treatment plans.

Slotnick (this issue) critically reviewed relevant fMRI findings and concludes WM 'does not activate the hippocampus.' We extend Slotnick's review by discussing observations from human intracranial and lesion research. These studies do suggest hippocampal contributions to WM (beyond novelty encoding), which however are difficult to capture with conventional fMRI. Still, the advent of new fMRI techniques combined with a stronger emphasis on shared hippocampal mechanisms across short- and long-term memory pave an exciting path forward.

However, the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the fMRI signals greatly limits the accuracy and resolution of current studies. In addressing this fundamental challenge in fMRI analytics, in this work we develop and implement a denoising method for task fMRI (tfMRI) data in order to delineate the high-resolution spatial pattern of the brain activation and functional connectivity via dictionary learning and sparse coding (DLSC). In addition to the traditional unsupervised dictionary learning model which has shown success in image denoising, we further utilize the prior knowledge of task paradigm to learn a dictionary consisting of both data-driven and model-driven terms for a more stable sparse representation of the data. The proposed method is applied to preprocess the motor tfMRI dataset from Human Connectome Project (HCP) for the purpose of brain activation detection and functional connectivity estimation. Comparison between the results from original and denoised fMRI data shows that the disruptive brain activation and functional connectivity patterns can be recovered, and the prominence of such patterns is improved through denoising. The proposed method is then compared with the temporal non-local means (tNLM)-based denoising method and shows consistently superior performance in various experimental settings. The promising results show that the proposed DLSC-based fMRI denoising method can effectively reduce the noise level of the fMRI signals and increase the interpretability of the inferred results, therefore constituting a crucial part of the preprocessing pipeline and provide the foundation for further high-resolution functional analysis.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) or Tractography, allows evaluation of the white matter fibers involved in language. Unlike fMRI, DTI does not rely on the patient's cooperation. In monolinguals, there is a significant correlation between the lateralization of language on fMRI and on DTI. Our objective is to delineate the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in right- and left-handed trilinguals and determine if the AF laterality on DTI is correlated to language lateralization on fMRI. 15 right and 15 left-handed trilingual volunteers underwent fMRI and DTI. Laterality Index was determined on fMRI (fMRI-LI). Mean Diffusivity, Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Number of Fibers, Fiber Length, Fiber Volume and Laterality Index (DTI-LI) of the AF were calculated on DTI. 28 of the 30 subjects presented a bilateral AF. Most subjects (52%) were found to have a bilateral language lateralization of the AF on DTI. Only 4 subjects had bilateral lateralization of language on fMRI. The right AF demonstrated lower diffusivity than the left AF in the total participants, the right-handed, and the left-handed subjects. FA, Volume and Length of the AF were not significantly different between the two hemispheres. No correlation was found between the DTI-LI of the AF and the fMRI-LI. A prominent role of the right AF and a bilateral structural organization of the AF was present in our multilingual population regardless of their handedness. While in prior studies DTI was able to determine language lateralization in monolingual subjects, this was not possible in trilingual highly educated subjects.

First, the spatial information and functional connectivity of each voxel in fMRI are utilized for presegmentation to create compact and functionally consistent super voxels, then extracts features, such as average spatial coordinates and average time series at the super voxel level to reduce the computational effort of the segmentation algorithm, and performs segmentation in a cut-free manner to obtain the optimal segmentation graph by minimizing the energy function. The results of contrast experiment demonstrated that the algorithm fully exploits the connectivity information of fMRI for segmentation, relies less on the spatial structure, and achieves better functional segmentation results, which is an effective whole-brain functional segmentation method.

Evaluating the concordance of functional MRI-based language lateralization and Wada testing in epilepsy patients: A single-center analysis	INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; fMRI; language; lateralization; Wada test	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; AMERICAN-ACADEMY; FMRI ACTIVATION; DOMINANCE; SURGERY; SUBCOMMITTEE; OUTCOMES	Background For patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, surgery may be effective in controlling their disease. Surgical evaluation may involve localization of the language areas using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Wada testing. We evaluated the accuracy of task-based fMRI versus Wada-based language lateralization in a cohort of our epilepsy patients. Methods In a single-center, retrospective analysis, we identified patients with medically intractable epilepsy who participated in presurgical language mapping (n = 35) with fMRI and Wada testing. Demographic variables and imaging metrics were obtained. We calculated the laterality index (LI) from task-evoked fMRI activation maps across language areas during auditory and reading tasks to determine lateralization. Possible scores for LI range from -1 (strongly left-hemisphere dominant) to 1 (strongly right-hemisphere dominant). Concordance between fMRI and Wada was estimated using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Association between the LI scores from the auditory and reading tasks was tested using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results The fMRI-based laterality indices were concordant with results from Wada testing in 91.4% of patients during the reading task (kappa = .55) and 96.9% of patients during the auditory task (kappa = .79). The mean LIs for the reading and auditory tasks were -0.52 +/- 0.43 and -0.68 +/- 0.42, respectively. The LI scores for the language and reading tasks were strongly correlated, r(30) = 0.57 (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our findings suggest that fMRI is generally an accurate, low-risk alternative to Wada testing for language lateralization. However, when fMRI indicates atypical language lateralization (e.g., bilateral dominance), patients may benefit from subsequent Wada testing or intraoperative language mapping.

The combination of intracranial electrical stimulation and whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE) makes it possible to study the network properties associated with electrical stimulation. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the brain network characteristics of RE patients with concurrent electrical stimulation and obtain possible clinical biomarkers.MethodsOur study used the GRETNA toolbox, a graph theoretical network analysis toolbox for imaging connectomics, to calculate and analyze the network topological attributes including global measures (small-world parameters and network efficiency) and nodal characteristics. The resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and the fMRI concurrent electrical stimulation (es-fMRI) of RE patients were utilized to make group comparisons with healthy controls to identify the differences in network topology properties. Network properties comparisons before and after electrode implantation in the same patient were used to further analyze stimulus-related changes in network properties. Modular analysis was used to examine connectivity and distribution characteristics in the brain networks of all participants in study.ResultsCompared to healthy controls, the rs-fMRI and the es-fMRI of RE patients exhibited impaired small-world property and reduced network efficiency. Nodal properties, such as nodal clustering coefficient (NCp), betweenness centrality (Bc), and degree centrality (Dc), exhibited differences between RE patients (including rs-fMRI and es-fMRI) and healthy controls. The network connectivity of RE patients (including rs-fMRI and es-fMRI) showed reduced intra-modular connections in subcortical areas and the occipital lobe, as well as decreased inter-modular connections between frontal and subcortical regions, and parieto-occipital regions compared to healthy controls. The brain networks of es-fMRI showed a relatively weaker small-world structure compared to rs-fMRI.ConclusionThe brain networks of RE patients exhibited a reduced small-world property, with a tendency toward random networks. The network connectivity patterns in RE patients exhibited reduced connections between cortical and subcortical regions and enhanced connections among parieto-occipital regions. Electrical stimulation can modulate brain network activity, leading to changes in network connectivity patterns and properties.

We evaluated the fMRI-related signal changes associated with standard and optimized microburst stimulation in a proof-of-concept study (NCT03446664). Methods: Twenty-nine drug-resistant epilepsy patients were prospectively implanted with VNS. Three 3T fMRI scans were collected 2 weeks postimplantation. The maximum tolerated VNS intensity was determined prior to each scan starting at 0.125 mA with 0.125 mA increments. FMRI scans were block-design with alternating 30 sec stimulation [ON] and 30 sec no stimulation [OFF]: Scan 1 utilized standard VNS and Scan 3 optimized microburst parameters to determine target settings. Semi-automated on-site fMRI data processing utilized ON-OFF block modeling to determine VNS-related fMRI activation per stimulation setting. Anatomical thalamic mask was used to derive highest mean thalamic t-value for determination of microburst stimulation parameters. Paired t-tests corrected at P < 0.05 examined differences in fMRI responses to each stimulation type. Results: Standard and microburst stimulation intensities at Scans 1 and 3 were similar (P = 0.16). Thalamic fMRI responses were obtained in 28 participants (19 with focal; 9 with generalized seizures). Group activation maps showed standard VNS elicited thalamic activation while optimized microburst VNS showed widespread activation patterns including thalamus. Comparison of stimulation types revealed significantly greater cerebellar, midbrain, and parietal fMRI signal changes in microburst compared to standard VNS. These differences were not associated with seizure responses. Interpretation: While standard and optimized microburst VNS elicited thalamic activation, microburst also engaged other brain regions. Relationship between these fMRI activation patterns and clinical response warrants further investigation. Clinical Trial Registration: The study was registered with (NCT03446664).

Imaging faster neural dynamics with fast fMRI: A need for updated models of the hemodynamic response	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						High-resolution fMRI; Brain hemodynamics; Biophysical modeling; Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent contrast; Human neuroimaging; Fast fMRI; Hemodynamic response function	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; TEMPORAL RESOLVING POWER; NONLINEAR BOLD RESPONSE; SLEEP SLOW OSCILLATION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; IN-VIVO	Fast fMRI enables the detection of neural dynamics over timescales of hundreds of milliseconds, suggesting it may provide a new avenue for studying subsecond neural processes in the human brain. The magnitudes of these fast fMRI dynamics are far greater than predicted by canonical models of the hemodynamic response. Several studies have established nonlinear properties of the hemodynamic response that have significant implications for fast fMRI. We first review nonlinear properties of the hemodynamic response function that may underlie fast fMRI signals. We then illustrate the breakdown of canonical hemodynamic response models in the context of fast neural dynamics. We will then argue that the canonical hemodynamic response function is not likely to reflect the BOLD response to neuronal activity driven by sparse or naturalistic stimuli or perhaps to spontaneous neuronal fluctuations in the resting state. These properties suggest that fast fMRI is capable of tracking surprisingly fast neuronal dynamics, and we discuss the neuroscientific questions that could be addressed using this approach.

Under TGN-020 injection the amplitude of the BOLD fMRI response became significantly higher. In contrast no significant changes in the DfMRI responses and the electrophysiological responses were observed. Those results further confirm the implications of astrocytes in the neurovascular coupling mechanism underlying BOLD fMRI, but not in the DfMRI responses which remained unsensitive to astrocyte function perturbation.

The development of 7 Tesla has played a critical role in this evolution by enabling higher resolution and more accurate functional maps. However, even with these gains, the fMRI approach is challenged relative to the spatial scale over which brain function is organized. Therefore, going forward, significant advances in fMRI are still needed. Such advances will predominantly come from magnetic fields significantly higher than 7 Tesla, which is the most commonly used ultrahigh magnetic field platform today, and additional technologies that will include developments predominantly in RF coil technologies, image reconstruction, noise suppression, and image analysis to further enhance and augment the gains that can be realized by going to higher magnetic fields.

However, its routinely application is limited by patient-related factors, such as cognitive disability and difficulty in coping with long-time acquisitions, and by technical factors, such as lack of equipment availability for stimuli delivery. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) instead, allows the identification of distinct language networks in a 10-min acquisition without the need of performing active tasks and using specific equipment. Therefore, to test the feasibility of rs-fMRI as a preoperative mapping tool, we reconstructed a lexico-semantic intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) in healthy controls (HC) and in a case series of patients with gliomas and compared the organization of this language network with the one derived from tb-fMRI in the patient's group. We studied three patients with extra-frontal gliomas who underwent functional mapping with auditory verb-generation (AVG) task and rs-fMRI with a seed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). First, we identified the functional connected areas to the IFG in HC. We qualitatively compared these areas with those that showed functional activation in AVG task derived from Neurosynth meta-analysis. Last, in each patient we performed single-subject analyses both for rs- and tb-fMRI, and we evaluated the spatial overlap between the two approaches. In HC, the IFG-ICN network showed a predominant left fronto-temporal functional connectivity in regions overlapping with the AVG network derived from a meta-analysis. In two patients, rs- and tb-fMRI showed comparable patterns of activation in left fronto-temporal regions, with different levels of contralateral activations. The third patient could not accomplish the AVG task and thus it was not possible to make any comparison with the ICN. However, in this patient, task-free approach disclosed a consistent network of fronto-temporal regions as in HC, and additional parietal regions. Our preliminary findings support the value of rs-fMRI approach for presurgical mapping, particularly for identifying left fronto-temporal core language-related areas in glioma patients. In a preoperative setting, rs-fMRI approach could represent a powerful tool for the identification of eloquent language areas, especially in patients with language or cognitive impairments.

Task-based functional connectivity of the Useful Field of View (UFOV) fMRI task	GEROSCIENCE			English	Article						Useful field of view; UFOV; Functional connectivity; Cognitive aging	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; PROCESSING-SPEED THEORY; OLDER-ADULTS; INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES; COGNITIVE SPEED; AGE-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; NETWORKS; ATTENTION	Declines in processing speed performance occur in aging and are a critical marker of functional independence in older adults. Numerous studies suggest that Useful Field of View (UFOV) training may ameliorate cognitive decline in older adults. Despite its efficacy, little is known about the neural correlates of this task. The current study is the first to investigate the coherence of functional connectivity during UFOV task completion. A total of 336 participants completed the UFOV task while undergoing task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ten spherical regions of interest (ROIs), selected a priori, were created based on regions with the greatest peak BOLD activation patterns in the UFOV fMRI task and regions that have been shown to significantly relate to UFOV fMRI task performance. We used a weighted ROI-to-ROI connectivity analysis to model task-specific functional connectivity strength between these a priori selected ROIs. We found that our UFOV fMRI network was functionally connected during task performance and was significantly associated to UFOV fMRI task performance. Within-network connectivity of the UFOV fMRI network showed comparable or better predictive power in accounting for UFOV accuracy compared to 7 resting state networks, delineated by Yeo and colleagues. Finally, we demonstrate that the within-network connectivity of UFOV fMRI task accounted for scores on a measure of "near transfer", the Double Decision task, better than the aforementioned resting state networks. Our data elucidate functional connectivity patterns of the UFOV fMRI task. This may assist in future targeted interventions that aim to improve synchronicity within the UFOV fMRI network.

One well-established application of fMRI in the clinical setting is the neurosurgical planning of patients with brain tumors near eloquent cortical areas. Clinical fMRI aims to preoperatively identify eloquent cortices that serve essential functions in daily life, such as hand movement and language. The primary goal of neurosurgery is to maximize tumor resection while sparing eloquent cortices adjacent to the tumor. When a lesion presents in the vicinity of an eloquent cortex, surgeons may use fMRI to plan their best surgical approach by determining the proximity of the lesion to regions of activation, providing guidance for awake brain surgery and intraoperative brain mapping. The acquisition of fMRI requires patient preparation prior to imaging, determination of functional paradigms, monitoring of patient performance, and both processing and analysis of images. Interpretation of fMRI maps requires a strong understanding of functional neuroanatomy and familiarity with the technical limitations frequently present in brain tumor imaging, including neurovascular uncoupling, patient compliance, and data analysis. This review discusses clinical fMRI in neuro-oncology, relevant ongoing research topics, and prospective future developments in this exciting discipline.

Two evaluators assessed epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, and surgical candidacy and defined confidence levels. They assessed these clinical characteristics first without EEG-fMRI and then including EEG-fMRI to assess how the results of EEG-fMRI changed the evaluations. We also determined how the clinical evaluation was affected by the concordance level between the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and the presumed focus location, and by the confidence level of the BOLD response itself based on the t-value of the primary and secondary clusters.ResultsFifty-one scans from 48 patients were included. The BOLD map affected 66.7% of the evaluations by altering evaluation items (epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy) or their confidence levels. EEG-fMRI results increased the confidence levels of epilepsy syndrome, presumed focus, or surgical candidacy in 47.1% of patients but reduced clinical confidence in these features in 11.8%. More specifically, the confidence levels increased for epilepsy syndrome in 28.5%, identification of presumed focus in 33.9%, and determination of surgical candidacy in 29.4%. The BOLD signal confidence level, whether high or low, did not influence these clinical factors.SignificancePrevious studies have emphasized the utility of EEG-fMRI for the localization of the epileptogenic zone. This study demonstrated the potential of EEG-fMRI to influence clinical confidence when determining epilepsy syndrome, the presumed epileptic focus, and surgical candidacy.

Accuracy analysis of fMRI and MEG activations determined by intraoperative mapping	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Article						brain mapping; brain tumor; eloquent; fMRI; MEG	DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BRAIN-TUMOR SURGERY; LANGUAGE AREAS; MOTOR CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; VALIDATION; LOCATION; MRI	OBJECTIVE By looking at how the accuracy of preoperative brain mapping methods vary according to differences in the distance from the activation clusters used for the analysis, the present study aimed to elucidate how preoperative functional neuroimaging may be used in such a way that maximizes the mapping accuracy. METHODS The eloquent function of 19 patients with a brain tumor or cavernoma was mapped prior to resection with both functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The mapping results were then validated using direct cortical stimulation mapping performed immediately after craniotomy and prior to resection. The subset of patients with equivalent MEG and fMRI tasks performed for motor (n = 14) and language (n = 12) were evaluated as both individual and combined predictions. Furthermore, the distance resulting in the maximum accuracy, as evaluated by the J statistic, was determined by plotting the sensitivities and specificities against a linearly increasing distance threshold. RESULTS fMRI showed a maximum mapping accuracy at 5 mm for both motor and language mapping. MEG showed a maximum mapping accuracy at 40 mm for motor and 15 mm for language mapping. At the standard 10-mm distance used in the literature, MEG showed a greater specificity than fMRI for both motor and language mapping but a lower sensitivity for motor mapping. Combining MEG and fMRI showed a maximum accuracy at 15 mm and 5 mm-MEG and fMRI distances, respectively-for motor mapping and at a 10-mm distance for both MEG and fMRI for language mapping. For motor mapping, combining MEG and fMRI at the optimal distances resulted in a greater accuracy than the maximum accuracy of the individual predictions. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that the accuracy of language and motor mapping for both fMRI and MEG is heavily dependent on the distance threshold used in the analysis. Furthermore, combining MEG and fMRI showed the potential for increased motor mapping accuracy compared to when using the modalities separately.

In this study, we aimed to, for the first time, investigate the interplay of simultaneous fMRI and FDG PET scan using a randomized self-control protocol. In total, 24 healthy volunteers underwent PET/MRI scan for 30-40 min after the injection of FDG. A 22-min brain scan was separated into MRI-off mode (without fMRI pulsing) and MRI-on mode (with fMRI pulsing), with each one lasting for 11 min. We calculated the voxel-wise fMRI metrics (regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and degree centrality), resting networks, relative standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr), SUVr slope, and regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlu) maps. Paired two-sample t-tests were applied to assess the statistical differences between SUVr, SUVr slope, correlation coefficients of fMRI metrics, and rCMRGlu between MRI-off and MRI-on modes, respectively. The voxel-wise whole-brain SUVr revealed no statistical difference (P > 0.05), while the SUVr slope was significantly elevated in sensorimotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, control, default, and auditory networks (P < 0.05) during fMRI scan. The task-based group independent-component analysis revealed that the most active network components derived from the combined MRI-off and MRI-on static PET images were frontal pole, superior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and occipital pole. High correlation coefficients were found among fMRI metrics with rCMRGlu in both MRI-off and MRI-on mode (P < 0.05). Our results systematically evaluated the impact of simultaneous fMRI scan on the quantification of human brain metabolism from an integrated PET/MRI system.

However, 40-70% of EEG-fMRI recordings in patients lack interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during the scan, which could be overcome by detecting matching topography maps. We tried to validate this method in clinical settings taking various electroclinical factors into consideration. Eleven patients who had undergone EEG-fMRI during pre-surgical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy and who had had clinical long-term video-EEG were studied. Spike-related blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) maps were created using IEDs occurring during the EEG-fMRI scan. Separate maps were then generated from IEDs marked on the clinical long-term EEG recordings, which were averaged to produce topographical IED maps and correlated with the EEGs recorded inside the scanner yielding a correlation coefficient time course. Epileptogenic zones were defined by an expert panel during pre-surgical evaluation and validated by an epilepsy surgery resulting in a good outcome. Both techniques' performance was evaluated according to factors including arousal during IED recording, IED topography and lateralization, lesion type, and localization. Topography-related EEG-fMRI yielded more specific results compared to the spike-related method. Superficial lesion location and ipsilateral IED seem to result in a higher concordance of BOLD maps. The polarity of BOLD responses may be lesion-dependent, and both positive and negative BOLD changes may be associated with the irritative zone. Topography-related EEG-fMRI may show improved specificity especially for superficial lesions producing ipsilateral spikes. This method can be used as an alternative either in the absence of spikes during the simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition or to sharpen a diffusely activated BOLD-map.

However, the extent to which fMRI temporal features exhibit stable markers of inter-individual differences in brain function across healthy young adults is currently an open question. In this study, we draw upon two widely used time-series measures-a nonlinear complexity measure (sample entropy; SampEn) and a spectral measure of low-frequency content (fALFF)-to capture dynamic properties of resting-state fMRI in a large sample of young adults from the Human Connectome Project. We observe that these two measures are closely related, and that both generate reproducible patterns across brain regions over four different fMRI runs, with intra-class correlations of up to 0.8. Moreover, we find that both metrics can uniquely differentiate subjects with high identification rates (ca. 89%). Canonical correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between multivariate brain temporal features and behavioral measures. Overall, these findings suggest that regional profiles of fMRI temporal characteristics may provide stable markers of individual differences, and motivate future studies to further probe relationships between fMRI time series metrics and behavior.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording has recently created new horizons to locate foci in patients with epilepsy and, in comparison with single-modality methods, has yielded more promising results although it is still subject to limitations such as lack of access to information between interictal events. This study assesses its potential added value in the presurgical evaluation of patients with complex source localization. Adult candidates considered ineligible for surgery on account of an unclear focus and/or presumed multifocality on the basis of EEG underwent EEG-fMRI. Adopting a component-based approach, this study attempts to identify the neural behavior of the epileptic generators and detect the components-of-interest which will later be used as input in the GLM model, substituting the classical linear regressor. Twenty-eight sets interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) from nine patients were analyzed. In eight patients, at least one BOLD response was significant, positive and topographically related to the IEDs. These patients were rejected for surgery because of an unclear focus in four, presumed multifocality in three, and a combination of the two conditions in two. Component-based EEG-fMRI improved localization in five out of six patients with unclear foci. In patients with presumed multifocality, component-based EEG-fMRI advocated one of the foci in five patients and confirmed multifocality in one of the patients. In seven patients, component-based EEG-fMRI opened new prospects for surgery and in two of these patients, intracranial EEG supported the EEG-fMRI results. In these complex cases, component-based EEG-fMRI either improved source localization or corroborated a negative decision regarding surgical candidacy. As supported by the statistical findings, the developed EEG-fMRI method leads to a more realistic estimation of localization compared to the conventional EEG-fMRI approach, making it a tool of high value in pre-surgical evaluation of patients with refractory epilepsy. To ensure proper implementation, we have included guidelines for the application of component-based EEG-fMRI in clinical practice.

Physiological noise modeling in fMRI based on the pulsatile component of photoplethysmograph	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						RETROICOR; CPM; fMRI artifacts; noise correction techniques; Cardiac pulsation; SLFOs; Global signal	RESTING-STATE FMRI; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; LINEAR-SYSTEMS ANALYSIS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; END-TIDAL CO2; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MOTION CORRECTION; RESPONSE FUNCTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY	The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism allows the noninvasive monitoring of changes in deoxyhemoglobin content. As such, it is commonly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activity since levels of deoxyhemoglobin are indirectly related to local neuronal activity through neurovascular coupling mechanisms. However, the BOLD signal is severely affected by physiological processes as well as motion. Due to this, several noise correction techniques have been developed to correct for the associated confounds. The present study focuses on cardiac pulsatility fMRI confounds, aiming to refine model-based techniques that utilize the photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal. Specifically, we propose a new technique based on convolution filtering, termed cardiac pulsatility model (CPM) and compare its performance with the cardiac-related RETROICOR (Card-RETROICOR), which is a technique commonly used to model fMRI fluctuations due to cardiac pulsatility. Further, we investigate whether variations in the amplitude of the PPG pulses (PPG-Amp) covary with variations in amplitude of pulse-related fMRI fluctuations, as well as with the systemic low frequency oscillations (SLFOs) component of the fMRI global signal (GS - defined as the mean signal across all gray matter voxels). Capitalizing on 3T fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, CPM was found to explain a significantly larger fraction of the fMRI signal variance compared to Card-RETROICOR, particularly for subjects with larger heart rate variability during the scan. The amplitude of the fMRI pulse-related fluctuations did not covary with PPG-Amp; however, PPG-Amp explained significant variance in the GS that was not attributed to variations in heart rate or breathing patterns. Our results suggest that the proposed approach can model high-frequency fluctuations due to pulsation as well as low-frequency physiological fluctuations more accurately compared to model-based techniques commonly employed in fMRI studies.

However, we know relatively little about the spatiotemporal characteristics of pRFs because neurons' temporal properties are one to two orders of magnitude faster than fMRI BOLD responses. Here, we developed an image-computable framework to estimate spatiotemporal pRFs from fMRI data. First, we developed a simulation software that predicts fMRI responses to a time-varying visual input given a spatiotemporal pRF model and solves the model parameters. The simulator revealed that ground-truth spatiotemporal parameters can be accurately recovered at the millisecond resolution from synthesized fMRI responses. Then, using fMRI and a novel stimulus paradigm, we mapped spatiotemporal pRFs in individual voxels across human visual cortex in 10 participants (both females and males). We find that a compressive spatiotemporal (CST) pRF model better explains fMRI responses than a conventional spatial pRF model across visual areas spanning the dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. Further, we find three organizational principles of spatiotemporal pRFs: (1) from early to later areas within a visual stream, spatial and temporal windows of pRFs progressively increase in size and show greater compressive nonlinearities, (2) later visual areas show diverging spatial and temporal windows across streams, and (3) within early visual areas (V1-V3), both spatial and temporal windows systematically increase with eccentricity. Together, this computational framework and empirical results open exciting new possibilities for modeling and measuring fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics of neural responses using fMRI.

Hemodynamic evaluation by use of breath-hold-triggered fMRI (bh-fMRI) was proposed as a readily available alternative to the diagnostic standard [O-15]water PET. Recent studies suggest voxel-wise hemodynamic delay correction in hypercapnia-triggered fMRI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of delay correction of bh-fMRI in patients with MMA and to compare the results with [O-15]water PET. Methods bh-fMRI data sets of 22 patients with MMA were evaluated without and with voxel-wise delay correction within different shift ranges and compared to the corresponding [O-15]water PET data sets. The effects were evaluated combined and in subgroups of data sets with most severely impaired CVR (apparent steal phenomenon), data sets with territorial time delay, and data sets with neither steal phenomenon nor delay between vascular territories. Results The study revealed a high mean cross-correlation (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) between bh-fMRI and [O-15]water PET. The correlation was strongly dependent on the choice of the shift range. Overall, no shift range revealed a significantly improved correlation between bh-fMRI and [O-15]water PET compared to the correlation without delay correction. Delay correction within shift ranges with positive high high cutoff revealed a lower agreement between bh-fMRI and PET overall and in all subgroups. Conclusion Voxel-wise delay correction, in particular with shift ranges with high cutoff, should be used critically as it can lead to false-negative results in regions with impaired CVR and a lower correlation to the diagnostic standard [O-15]water PET.

Combining electrostimulation with feedback from fMRI can provide information about the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects, but so far, such studies have been hampered by the lack of technology to conduct safe and accurate experiments. Here we present a system for fMRI compatible electrical stimulation, and the first proof-of-concept neuroimaging data with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in pigs obtained with the device.New method: The system consists of two modules, placed in the control and scanner room, connected by optical fiber. The system also connects to the MRI scanner to timely initiate the stimulation sequence at start of scan. We evaluated the system in four pigs with DBS in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) while we acquired BOLD responses in the STN and neocortex.Results: We found that the system delivered robust electrical stimuli to the implanted electrode in sync with the preprogrammed fMRI sequence. All pigs displayed a DBS-STN induced neocortical BOLD response, but none in the STN.Comparisons with existing method: The system solves three major problems related to electric stimuli and fMRI examinations, namely preventing distortion of the fMRI signal, enabling communication that synchronize the experimental conditions, and surmounting the safety hazards caused by interference with the MRI scanner. Conclusions: The fMRI compatible electrical stimulator circumvents previous problems related to electroceuticals and fMRI. The system allows flexible modifications for fMRI designs and stimulation parameters, and can be customized to electroceutical applications beyond DBS.

The LC serves as a major brainstem relay for both ascending bottom-up and descending top-down projections. Specifically, noradrenergic (NA) LC neurons not only connect globally to higher-order subcortical nuclei and cortex to mediate arousal and attention but also directly project to other brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord to control autonomic function. Despite the extensive investigation of LC function using electrophysiological recordings and cellular/molecular imaging for both cognitive research and the contribution of LC to different pathological states, the role of neuroimaging to investigate LC function has been restricted. For instance, it remains challenging to identify LC-specific activation with functional MRI (fMRI) in animal models, due to the small size of this nucleus. Here, we discuss the complexity of fMRI applications toward LC activity mapping in mouse brains by highlighting the technological challenges. Further, we introduce a single-vessel fMRI mapping approach to elucidate the vascular specificity of high-resolution fMRI signals coupled to LC activation in the mouse brainstem.

Model-based physiological noise removal in fast fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						HRAN; Fast fMRI; Physiological noise; Autocorrelation; Harmonic regression; Simultaneous multislice (SMS)	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION; BOLD; SIGNAL; RESOLUTION; IMPACT; MRI; ANTICORRELATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS	Recent improvements in the speed and sensitivity of fMRI acquisition techniques suggest that fast fMRI can be used to detect and precisely localize sub-second neural dynamics. This enhanced temporal resolution has enormous potential for neuroscientists. However, physiological noise poses a major challenge for the analysis of fast fMRI data. Physiological noise scales with sensitivity, and its autocorrelation structure is altered in rapidly sampled data, suggesting that new approaches are needed for physiological noise removal in fast fMRI. Existing strategies either rely on external physiological recordings, which can be noisy or difficult to collect, or employ data-driven approaches which make assumptions that may not hold true in fast fMRI. We created a statistical model of harmonic regression with autoregressive noise (HRAN) to estimate and remove cardiac and respiratory noise from the fMRI signal directly. This technique exploits the fact that cardiac and respiratory noise signals are fully sampled (rather than aliasing) when imaging at fast rates, allowing us to track and model physiology over time without requiring external physiological measurements. We then created a joint model of neural hemodynamics, and physiological and autocorrelated noise to more accurately remove noise. We first verified that HRAN accurately estimates cardiac and respiratory dynamics and that our model demonstrates goodness-of-fit in fast fMRI data. In task-driven data, we then demonstrated that HRAN is able to remove physiological noise while leaving the neural signal intact, thereby increasing detection of task-driven voxels. Finally, we established that in both simulations and fast fMRI data HRAN is able to improve statistical inferences as compared with gold-standard physiological noise removal techniques. In conclusion, we created a tool that harnesses the novel information in fast fMRI to remove physiological noise, enabling broader use of the technology to study human brain function.

Correcting for Superficial Bias in 7T Gradient Echo fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						7T GE-fMRI; fMRI methods; superficial bias correction; Deming regression; computational modeling	VISUAL-CORTEX; PATTERN; BOLD; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION; SIGNAL; LAYERS	The arrival of submillimeter ultra high-field fMRI makes it possible to compare activation profiles across cortical layers. However, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measured by gradient echo (GE) fMRI is biased toward superficial layers of the cortex, which is a serious confound for laminar analysis. Several univariate and multivariate analysis methods have been proposed to correct this bias. We compare these methods using computational simulations of 7T fMRI data from regions of interest (ROI) during a visual attention paradigm. We also tested the methods on a pilot dataset of human 7T fMRI data. The simulations show that two methods-the ratio of ROI means across conditions and a novel application of Deming regression-offer the most robust correction for superficial bias. Deming regression has the additional advantage that it does not require that the conditions differ in their mean activation over voxels within an ROI. When applied to the pilot dataset, we observed strikingly different layer profiles when different attention metrics were used, but were unable to discern any differences in laminar attention across layers when Deming regression or ROI ratio was applied. Our simulations demonstrates that accurate correction of superficial bias is crucial to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions from laminar analyses of GE fMRI data, and this is affirmed by the results from our pilot 7T fMRI data.

FMRI Complexity Correlates with Tau-PET and Cognitive Decline in Late-Onset and Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; complexity; multi scale entropy; rs-fMRI; tau-PET	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; RECOMMENDATIONS; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; ENTROPY; MRI	Background: Neurofibrillary tangle pathology detected with tau-PET correlates closely with neuronal injury and cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Complexity of rs-fMRI has been demonstrated to decrease with cognitive decline in AD. Objective: We hypothesize that the rs-fMRI complexity provides an index for tau-related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD process. Methods: Data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI3) and the Estudio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Jalisciences (EEAJ) study. Associations between tau-PET and rs-fMRI complexity were calculated. Potential pathways relating complexity to cognitive function mediated through tau-PET were assessed by path analysis. Results: We found significant negative correlations between rs-fMRI complexity and tau-PET in medial temporal lobe of both cohorts, and associations of rs-fMRI complexity with cognitive scores were mediated through tau-PET. Conclusion: The association of rs-fMRI complexity with tau-PET and cognition, suggests that a reduction in complexity is indicative of tau-related neuropathology and cognitive decline in AD processes.

Investigating mechanisms of fast BOLD responses: The effects of stimulus intensity and of spatial heterogeneity of hemodynamics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Fast fMRI; Hemodynamic response function; Nonlinearity; Task intensity; Resting state; High spatial resolution	CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; LUMINANCE CONTRAST; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN-REGIONS; ALPHA-BAND; FMRI; ACTIVATION; EEG; ATTENTION	Recent studies have demonstrated that fast fMRI can track neural activity well above the temporal limit predicted by the canonical hemodynamic response model. While these findings are promising, the biophysical mechanisms underlying these fast fMRI phenomena remain underexplored. In this study, we discuss two aspects of the hemodynamic response, complementary to several existing hypotheses, that can accommodate faster fMRI dynamics beyond those predicted by the canonical model. First, we demonstrate, using both visual and somatosensory paradigms, that the timing and shape of hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) vary across graded levels of stimulus intensity -with lower-intensity stimulation eliciting faster and narrower HRFs. Second, we show that as the spatial resolution of fMRI increases, voxel-wise HRFs begin to deviate from the canonical model, with a considerable portion of voxels exhibiting faster temporal dynamics than predicted by the canonical HRF. Collectively, both stimulus/task intensity and image resolution can affect the sensitivity of fMRI to fast brain activity, which may partly explain recent observations of fast fMRI signals. It is further noteworthy that, while the present investigations focus on fast neural responses, our findings suggest that a revised hemodynamic model may benefit the many fMRI studies using paradigms with wide ranges of contrast levels (e.g., resting or naturalistic conditions) or with modern, high-resolution MR acquisitions.

Compared with resting-state fMRI, fMRI combined with stimulation could be used to assess the activation of specific brain regions and the connectivity of specific pathways and achieve better signal capture with a clear purpose and more significant results. Various fMRI methods and specific stimulation paradigms have been proposed to investigate brain activation in a specific state, such as electrical, mechanical, visual, olfactory, and direct brain stimulation. In this review, the studies on animal brain activation using fMRI combined with different stimulation methods were retrieved. The instruments, experimental parameters, anesthesia, and animal models in different stimulation conditions were summarized. The findings would provide a reference for studies on estimating specific brain activation using fMRI combined with stimulation.

Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is widely used for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as depression, motor stroke, and neuropathic pain. However, the underlying mechanisms of rTMS-mediated neuronal modulation are not fully understood. In this respect, concurrent or simultaneous TMS-fMRI, in which TMS is applied during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is a viable tool to gain insights, as it enables an investigation of the immediate effects of TMS. Concurrent application of TMS during neuroimaging usually causes severe artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities induced by TMS. However, by carefully interleaving the TMS pulses with MR signal acquisition in the way that these are far enough apart, we can avoid any image distortions. While the very first feasibility studies date back to the 1990s, recent developments in coil hardware and acquisition techniques have boosted the number of TMS-fMRI applications. As such, a concurrent application requires expertise in both TMS and MRI mechanisms and sequencing, and the hurdle of initial technical set up and maintenance remains high. This review gives a comprehensive overview of concurrent TMS-fMRI techniques by collecting (1) basic information, (2) technical challenges and developments, (3) an overview of findings reported so far using concurrent TMS-fMRI, and (4) current limitations and our suggestions for improvement. By sharing this review, we hope to attract the interest of researchers from various backgrounds and create an educational knowledge base.				yuki.tiebel@med.uni-muenchen.de	Keeser, Daniel/C-8888-2016	Keeser, Daniel/0000-0002-0244-1024; Tik, Martin/0000-0002-6571-4413; Windischberger, Christian/0000-0002-9944-0190	German Research Foundation (DFG; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [INST 86/1739-1 FUGG]	German Research Foundation (DFG; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG))	The study was done using the NICUM Siemens Prisma scanner supported by German Research Foundation (DFG; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [grant number INST 86/1739-1 FUGG].		116	13	16	14	40	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-0640			FRONT PSYCHIATRY	Front.

The intersubject alignment of fMRI can improve the statistical power of group analyses. Recent studies have shown the deep learning-based registration methods can be used for registration. In our work, we proposed a 30-Identity-Mapping Cascaded network (30-IMCNet) for rs-fMRI registration. It is a cascaded network that can warp the moving image progressively and finally align to the fixed image. A Combination unit with an identity-mapping path is added to the inputs of each IMCNet to guide the network training. We implemented 30-IMCNet on an rs-fMRI dataset (1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset) and a task-related fMRI dataset (Eyes Open Eyes Closed fMRI dataset). To evaluate our method, a group-level analysis was implemented in the testing dataset. For rs-fMRI, the criterions such as peak t-value of group-level t-maps, cluster-level evaluation, and intersubject functional network correlation were used to evaluate the quality of the registrations. For task-related fMRI, peak t-value in ALFF paired-t map and peak t-value in ReHo paired-t maps were used. Compared with traditional algorithm FSL, SPM, and deep learning algorithm Kim et al, Zhao et al our method has improvements of 48.90%, 30.73%, 36.38%, and 16.73% in the peak t value of t-maps. Our proposed method can achieve superior functional registration performance and thus gain a significant improvement in functional consistency.

In this paper, we propose a model that simultaneously utilizes characteristics of both spatial and temporal sequential information of fMRI data with deep neural networks to classify the fMRI task states. We designed a convolution network module and a recurrent network module to extract the spatial and temporal features of fMRI data, respectively. In particular, we also add the attention mechanism to the recurrent network module, which more effectively highlights the brain activation state at the moment of reaction. We evaluated the model using task-evoked fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, the classification accuracy got 94.31%, and the experimental results have shown that the model can effectively distinguish the brain states under different task stimuli.

Predicting visual features from neuronal activity	ISCIENCE			English	Article							FMRI; RECOVERY	Understanding brain response to audiovisual stimuli is a key challenge in understanding neuronal processes. In this paper, we describe our effort aimed at reconstructing video frames from observed functional MRI images. We also demonstrate that our model can predict visual objects. Our method constructs an autoencoder model for a set of training video segments to code video streams into their corresponding latent representations. Next, we learn a mapping from the observed fMRI response to the corresponding latent video frame representation. Finally, we pass the latent vectors computed using the fMRI response through the decoder to reconstruct the predicted image. We show that the representations of video frames and those constructed from corresponding fMRI images are highly clustered, the latent representations can be used to predict objects in video frames using just the fMRI frames, and fMRI responses can be used to reconstruct the inputs to predict the presence of faces.

However, in mice the temporal stability of neuronal states and networks in resting-state (rs)-fMRI experiments during the combined ISO/MED regimen has not been systematically investigated. Using a multimodal approach with optical calcium (Ca2+) recordings and rs-fMRI, we investigated cortical neuronal/astrocytic Ca2+ activity states and brain networks at multiple time points while switching from anesthesia with 1% ISO to a combined ISO/MED regimen. We found that cortical activity states reached a steady-state 45 min following start of MED infusion as indicated by stable Ca2+ transients. Similarly, rs-networks were not statistically different between anesthesia with ISO and the combined ISO/MED regimen 45 and 100 min after start of MED. Importantly, during the transition time we identified changed rs-network signatures that likely reflect the different mode of action of the respective anesthetic; these included a dose-dependent increase in cortico-cortical functional connectivity (FC) presumably caused by reduction of ISO concentration and decreased FC in subcortical arousal nuclei due to MED infusion. Furthermore, we report detection of visual stimulation-induced BOLD fMRI during the stable ISO/MED neuronal state 45 min after induction. Based on our findings, we recommend a 45-minute waiting period after switching from ISO anesthesia to the combined ISO/MED regimen before performing rs- or task-induced fMRI experiments.

J	Jung, WB; Jiang, HY; Lee, S; Kim, SG				Jung, Won Beom; Jiang, Haiyan; Lee, Soohyun; Kim, Seong-Gi			Dissection of brain-wide resting-state and functional somatosensory circuits by fMRI with optogenetic silencing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						fMRI; somatosensory network; neuronal inhibition; circuit dissection; resting-state connectivity	BARREL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BLOOD-OXYGENATION; NEURONAL CIRCUITS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; TRANSFORMATION	To further advance functional MRI (fMRI)-based brain science, it is critical to dissect fMRI activity at the circuit level. To achieve this goal, we combined brain-wide fMRI with neuronal silencing in well-defined regions. Since focal inactivation suppresses excitatory output to downstream pathways, intact input and suppressed out-put circuits can be separated. Highly specific cerebral blood volume-weighted fMRI was performed with optogenetic stimula-tion of local GABAergic neurons in mouse somatosensory regions. Brain-wide spontaneous somatosensory networks were found mostly in ipsilateral cortical and subcortical areas, which differed from the bilateral homotopic connections commonly observed in resting-state fMRI data. The evoked fMRI responses to somatosen-sory stimulation in regions of the somatosensory network were successfully dissected, allowing the relative contributions of spino-thalamic (ST), thalamocortical (TC), corticothalamic (CT), cortico-cortical (CC) inputs, and local intracortical circuits to be determined. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus receives ST inputs, while the posterior medial thalamic nucleus receives CT inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with TC inputs. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) receives mostly direct CC inputs from S1 and a few TC inputs from the ventral posterolateral nucleus. The TC and CC input layers in cortical regions were identi-fied by laminar-specific fMRI responses with a full width at half maximum of <150 mu m. Long-range synaptic inputs in cortical areas were amplified approximately twofold by local intracortical cir-cuits, which is consistent with electrophysiological recordings. Overall, whole-brain fMRI with optogenetic inactivation revealed brain-wide, population-based, long-range circuits, which could complement data typically collected in conventional microscopic functional circuit studies.

G.			fMRI study of olfactory processing in mice under three anesthesia protocols: Insight into the effect of ketamine on olfactory processing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Ketamine; Mice; Anesthesia; Olfactory; Dexmedetomidine	LAYER-DEPENDENT BOLD; LATERAL INHIBITION; NMDA-RECEPTOR; MOUSE-BRAIN; BULB; RAT; RESPONSES; ACTIVATION; PIRIFORM; MODEL	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable tool for studying neural activations in the central nervous system of animals due to its wide spatial coverage and non-invasive nature. However, the advantages of fMRI have not been fully realized in functional studies in mice, especially in the olfactory system, possibly due to the lack of suitable anesthesia protocols with spontaneous breathing. Since mice are widely used in biomedical research, it is desirable to evaluate different anesthesia protocols for olfactory fMRI studies in mice. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) as a sedative/anesthetic has been introduced to fMRI studies in mice, but it has a limited anesthesia duration. To extend the anesthesia duration, DEX has been combined with a low dose of isoflurane (ISO) or ketamine (KET) in previous functional studies in mice. In this report, olfactory fMRI studies were performed under three anesthesia protocols (DEX alone, DEX/ISO, and DEX/KET) in three different groups of mice. Isoamyl-acetate was used as an odorant, and the odorant-induced neural activations were measured by blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. BOLD fMRI responses were observed in the olfactory bulb (OB), anterior olfactory nuclei (AON), and piriform cortex (Pir). Interestingly, BOLD fMRI activations were also observed in the prefrontal cortical region (PFC), which are most likely caused by the draining vein effect. The response in the OB showed no adaptation to either repeated odor stimulations or continuous odor exposure, but the response in the Pir showed adaptation during the continuous odor exposure. The data also shows that ISO suppresses the olfactory response in the OB and AON, while KET enhances the olfactory response in the Pir. Thus, DEX/KET should be an attractive anesthesia for olfactory fMRI in mice.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a widely employed technology for this purpose. A preoperative neuropsychological evaluation should accompany this exam. However, only a few studies have reported both neuropsychological tests and fMRI tasks for preoperative planning-the current study aimed to systematically review the scientific literature on the topic. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We included studies that reported both neuropsychological tests and fMRI. Exclusion criteria were: no brain tumors, underage patients, no preoperative assessment, resting-state fMRI only, or healthy sample population/preclinical studies. Results: We identified 123 papers, but only 15 articles were included. Eight articles focused on language; three evaluated cognitive performance; single papers studied sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal functions, insular cortex, and cerebellar activation. Two qualitative studies focused on visuomotor function and language. According to some authors, there was a strong correlation between performance in presurgical neuropsychological tests and fMRI. Several papers suggested that selecting well-adjusted and individualized neuropsychological tasks may enable the development of personalized and more efficient protocols. The fMRI findings may also help identify plasticity phenomena to avoid unintentional damage during neurosurgery. Conclusions: Most studies have focused on language, the most commonly evaluated cognitive function. The correlation between neuropsychological and fMRI results suggests that altered functions during the neuropsychological assessment may help identify patients who could benefit from an fMRI and, possibly, functions that should be tested. Neuropsychological evaluation and fMRI have complementary roles in the preoperative assessment.

Mixed-dictionary models and variational inference in task fMRI for shorter scans and better image quality	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Task fMRI; Shorter scans; Mixed dictionary; Design matrix; Wavelets; VBEM; Nested minorization; Uncertainty; Denoising; Reconstruction	UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; RECONSTRUCTION; REDUCTION; SIGNAL; SENSE; RANK; EPI; MRI	The propensity of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (T-fMRI) to large physiological fluctuations, measurement noise, and imaging artifacts entail longer scans and higher temporal resolution (trading off spatial resolution) to alleviate the effects of degradation. This paper focuses on methods towards reducing scan times and enabling higher spatial resolution in T-fMRI. We propose a novel mixed dictionary model combining (i) the task-based design matrix, (ii) a learned dictionary from resting-state fMRI, and (iii) an analytically-defined wavelet frame. For model fitting, we propose a novel adaptation of the inference framework relying on variational Bayesian expectation maximization with nested minorization. We leverage the mixed-dictionary model coupled with variational inference to enable 2 x shorter scan times in T-fMRI, improving activation-map estimates towards the same quality as those resulting from longer scans. We also propose a scheme with potential to increase spatial resolution through temporally undersampled acquisition. Results on motor-task fMRI and gambling-task fMRI show that our framework leads to improved activation-map estimates over the state of the art.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, electrocorticography (ECoG) measures were used to predict functional MRI changes in the sensorimotor cortex in two brain states: at rest and during motor performance. The specificity of this relationship to spatial co-localisation of the two signals was also investigated. We acquired simultaneous ECoG-fMRI in the sensorimotor cortex of three patients with epilepsy. During motor activity, high gamma power was the only frequency band where the electrophysiological response was co-localised with fMRI measures across all subjects. The best model of fMRI changes across states was its principal components, a parsimonious description of the entire ECoG spectrogram.

Indeed, with recent advances in ultra-high-field ( >= 7T) MRI hardware and associated sequence libraries, it has become possible to capture non-invasive CBV weighted fMRI signals across cortical layers. One of the most widely used approaches to achieve this (in humans) is through vascular-space-occupancy (VASO) fMRI. Unfortunately, the exact contrast mechanisms of layer-dependent VASO fMRI have not been validated for human fMRI and thus interpretation of such data is confounded. Here we validate the signal source of layer-dependent SS-SI VASO fMRI using multi-modal imaging in a rat model in response to neuronal activation (somatosensory cortex) and respiratory challenge (hypercapnia). In particular VASO derived CBV measures are directly compared to concurrent measures of total haemoglobin changes from high resolution intrinsic optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS). Quantified cortical layer profiling is demonstrated to be in agreement between VASO and contrast enhanced fMRI (using monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles, MION). Responses show high spatial localisation to layers of cortical processing independent of confounding large draining veins which can hamper BOLD fMRI studies, (depending on slice positioning). Thus, a cross species comparison is enabled using VASO as a common measure. We find increased VASO based CBV reactivity (3.1 +/- 1.2 fold increase) in humans compared to rats. Together, our findings confirm that the VASO contrast is indeed a reliable estimate of layer-specific CBV changes. This validation study increases the neuronal interpretability of human layer-dependent VASO fMRI as an appropriate method in neuroscience application studies, in which the presence of large draining intracortical and pial veins limits neuroscientific inference with BOLD fMRI.

One fMRI technique used to identify the functional brain network is the resting-state-fMRI (rs-fMRI). This technique is not routinely available because of the necessity to have an expert reviewer who can manually identify each functional network. The lack of sufficient unhealthy data has so far hindered a data-driven approach based on machine learning tools for full automation of this clinical task. In this article, we investigate the possibility of such an approach via the transfer learning method from healthy control data to unhealthy patient data to boost the detection of functional brain networks in rs-fMRI data. The end-to-end deep learning model implemented in this article distinguishes seven principal functional brain networks using fMRI images. The best performance of a 75% correct recognition rate is obtained from the proposed deep learning architecture, which shows its superiority over other machine learning algorithms that were equally tested for this classification task. Based on this best reference model, we demonstrate the possibility of boosting the results of our algorithm with transfer learning from healthy patients to unhealthy patients. This application of the transfer learning technique opens interesting possibilities because healthy control subjects can be easily enrolled for fMRI data acquisition since it is noninvasive. Consequently, this process helps to compensate for the usual small cohort of unhealthy patient data. This transfer learning approach could be extended to other medical imaging modalities and pathology.

Introduction: Our aim was to evaluate with fMRI, in a 3 Tesla system, the functional effects of HBOT on the Central Nervous System (CNS) in four Pts with established ischaemic and haemorrhagic cerebral strokes (2 Pts each). To our knowledge, no author used fMRI technique for this purpose, till now. Methods: All four Pts underwent a fMRI study before and after 40 HBOT sessions, with a time window of a few days. They carried out two language (text listening, silent word-verb generation) and two motor (hand and foot movements) tasks (30 s On-Off block paradigms). Results: After HBOT, all Pts reported a clinical improvement, mostly concerning language fluency and motor paresis. fMRI analysis demonstrated an increase in both the extent and the statistical significance of most of the examined eloquent areas. Conclusions: These changes were consistent with the clinical improvement in all Pts, suggesting a possible role of fMRI in revealing neuronal functional correlates of neuronal plasticity and HBOT-related neoangiogenesis. Although only four Pts were examined, fMRI proved to be a sensitive, non-invasive and reliable modality for monitoring neuronal functional changes before and after HBOT.

Due to its non-invasive, sensitive and analytical nature, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides valuable insights into relevant functional brain networks and their segregation and integration properties. We systematically reviewed the contribution of resting-state and task-based fMRI to the current understanding of the pathophysiology and the patterns of seizure propagation in JME Altogether, despite some discrepancies, functional findings suggest that corticothalamo-striato-cerebellar network along with default-mode network and salience network are the most affected networks in patients with JME. However, further studies are required to investigate the association between JME's main deficiencies, e.g., motor and cognitive deficiencies and fMRI findings. Moreover, simultaneous electroencephalography-fMRI (EEG-fMRI) studies indicate that alterations of these networks play a role in seizure modulation but fall short of identifying a causal relationship between altered functional properties and seizure propagation. This review highlights the complex pathophysiology of JME, which necessitates the design of more personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this group.

We hypothesized that it was feasible to acquire a reliable and responsive fMRI during asleep VIM DBS surgery. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 10 consecutive patients who underwent asleep DBS for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor. Under general anesthesia, we acquired resting-state functional MRI immediately before and after the cannula insertion. Reliability was determined by a temporal signal-to-noise-ratio >100. Responsiveness was determined based on the fMRI signal change upon insertion of the cannula to the VIM. Results: It was feasible to acquire reliable fMRI during asleep DBS surgery. The fMRI signal was responsive to the brain cannula insertion, revealing a reduction in the tremor network's functional connectivity, which did not reach statistical significance in the group analysis. Conclusions: It is feasible to acquire a reliable and responsive fMRI signal during asleep DBS. The acquisition steps and the preprocessing pipeline developed in these experiments will be useful for future investigations to develop fMRI-based feedback for asleep DBS surgery.

Low Cost MR Compatible Haptic Stimulation with Application to fMRI Neurofeedback	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						fMRI neurofeedback; haptic; vibration; amygdala		The most common feedback displays in the fMRI environment are visual, e.g., in which participants try to increase or decrease the level of a thermometer. However, haptic feedback is increasingly valued in computer interaction tasks, particularly for real-time fMRI feedback. fMRI-neurofeedback is a clinical intervention that has not yet taken advantage of this trend. Here we describe a low-cost, user-friendly, MR-compatible system that can provide graded haptic vibrotactile stimulation in an initial application to fMRI neurofeedback. We also present a feasibility demonstration showing that we could successfully set up the system and obtain data in the context of a neurofeedback paradigm. We conclude that vibrotactile stimulation using this low-cost system is a viable method of feedback presentation, and encourage neurofeedback researchers to incorporate this type of feedback into their studies.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) research is a noninvasive and extensive method, which is aimed at the research of the mechanism of acupuncture. Researchers use fMRI technologies to inspect the acupuncture process. The authors reviewed the application of rs-fMRI in acupuncture research in recent 10 years from the aspects of studying acupoints, subjects, acupuncture methods, and intensities. The results found that the application of rs-fMRI in acupuncture research mainly includes research on the onset mechanism of acupuncture treatment; visual evidence of diagnosis and treatment of dominant diseases; efficacy assessments; physiological mechanism of acupoint stimulation; and specific visualization of acupoints.

It is well established that adequate acclimation to the loud fMRI environment and head fixation reduces stress in the rodents and allows for whole brain imaging with little contamination from motion. However, it is unknown whether high-resolution fMRI with increased susceptibility to motion and lower sensitivity can measure small, but spatially discrete, activations in awake mice. To examine this, we used contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume-weighted (CBVw) fMRI in the mouse olfactory bulb for its enhanced sensitivity and neural specificity. We determined that activation patterns in the glomerular layer to four different odors were spatially distinct and were consistent with previously estab-lished histological patterns. In addition, odor-evoked laminar activations were greatest in superficial layers that decreased with laminar depth, similar to previous observations. Interestingly, the fMRI response strengths in the granule cell layer were greater in awake mice than our previous anesthetized rat studies, suggesting that feedback neural activities were intact with wakefulness. We finally determined that fMRI signal changes to repeated odor exposure (i.e., olfactory adaptation) attenuated relatively more in the feedback granule cell layer compared to the input glomerular layer, which is consistent with prior observations. We, therefore, conclude that high-resolution CBVw fMRI can measure odor-specific activation patterns and distinguish changes in laminar activity of head and body restrained awake mice.

Here we describe a multimodal dataset of EEG and fMRI acquired simultaneously during a motor imagery NF task, supplemented with MRI structural data. The study involved 30 healthy volunteers undergoing five training sessions. We showed the potential and merit of simultaneous EEG-fMRI NF in previous work. Here we illustrate the type of information that can be extracted from this dataset and show its potential use. This represents one of the first simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI for NF and here we present the first open access bi-modal NF dataset integrating EEG and fMRI. We believe that it will be a valuable tool to (1) advance and test methodologies for multi-modal data integration, (2) improve the quality of NF provided, (3) improve methodologies for de-noising EEG acquired under MRI and (4) investigate the neuromarkers of motor-imagery using multi-modal information.

J	Daly, I				Daly, Ian			Removal of physiological artifacts from simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; Artifact removal; ICA	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOVEMENT; IDENTIFICATION	Objective: Simultaneous recording of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows a combination of eletrophysiological and haemodynamic information to be used to form a more complete picture of cerebral dynamics. However, EEG recorded within the MRI scanner is contaminated by both imaging artifacts and physiological artifacts. The majority of the techniques used to pre-process such EEG focus on removal of the imaging and balistocardiogram artifacts, with some success, but don't remove all other physiological artifacts. Methods: We propose a new offline EEG artifact removal method based upon a combination of independent component analysis and fMRI-based head movement estimation to aid the removal of physiological artifacts from EEG recorded during EEG-fMRI recordings. Our method makes novel use of head movement trajectories estimated from the fMRI recording in order to assist with identifying physiological artifacts in the EEG and is designed to be used after removal of the fMRI imaging artifact from the EEG. Results: We evaluate our method on EEG recorded during a joint EEG-fMRI session from healthy adult participants. Our method significantly reduces the influence of all types of physiological artifacts on the EEG. We also compare our method with a state-of-the-art physiological artifact removal method and demonstrate superior performance removing physiological artifacts. Conclusions: Our proposed method is able to remove significantly more physiological artifact components from the EEG, recorded during a joint EEG-fMRI session, than other state-of-the-art methods. Significance: Our proposed method represents a marked improvement over current processing pipelines for removing physiological noise from EEG recorded during a joint EEG-fMRI session.

Because animals need to be immobilised for image acquisition, fMRI is commonly performed under anaesthesia. The choice of anaesthetic protocols and may affect fMRI readouts, either directly or via changing physiological balance, and thereby threaten the scientific validity of fMRI in rodents. Methods: The present study systematically reviewed the literature investigating the influence of different anaesthesia regimes and changes in physiological parameters as confounders of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI in rats and mice. Four databases were searched, studies selected according to pre-defined criteria, and risk of bias assessed for each study. Results are reported in two separate articles; this part of the review focuses on effects of changes in physiological parameters. Results: A total of 121 publications was included, of which 49 addressed effects of changes in physiological parameters. Risk of bias was high in all included studies. Blood oxygenation [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p(a)O(2))], ventilation [arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(a)CO(2))] and arterial blood pressure affected BOLD fMRI readouts across various experimental paradigms. Conclusions: Blood oxygenation, ventilation and arterial blood pressure should be monitored and maintained at stable physiological levels throughout experiments. Appropriate anaesthetic management and monitoring are crucial to obtain scientifically valid, reproducible results from fMRI studies in rodent models.

By segmenting fMRI images, large-scale medical image data can be processed more efficiently. Most deep learning (DL)-based segmentation typically uses some type of encoding-decoding model. In this study, affective computing (AC) was developed using the brain fMRI dataset generated from an emotion simulation experiment. The brain fMRI dataset was segmented using an attention model, a deep convolutional neural network-32 (DCNN-32) based on Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter, called ADCNN-32-G. For the evaluation of image segmentation, several indices are presented. By comparing the proposed ADCNN-32s-G model to distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE), single-seeded region growing, and the single segNet full convolutional network model (FCN), the proposed model performs well in segmenting mass fMRI datasets. The proposed method can be applied to the real-time monitoring of patients with depression, and it can effectively advise human mental health. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

What Is the Test-Retest Reliability of Common Task-Functional MRI Measures? New Empirical Evidence and a Meta-Analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						neuroimaging; individual differences; statistical analysis; cognitive neuroscience	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SAMPLE-SIZE; FMRI; BIOMARKERS; ROBUST	Identifying brain biomarkers of disease risk is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is limited by measurement reliability; unreliable measures are unsuitable for predicting clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task functional MRI (fMRI) is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments (N = 1,008) revealed poor overall reliability-mean intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = .397. Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 common fMRI tasks collected by the Human Connectome Project (N = 45) and the Dunedin Study (N = 20) were poor (ICCs = .067-.485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that common task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or for individual-differences research. We review how this state of affairs came to be and highlight avenues for improving task-fMRI reliability.

A relatively under-explored question is whether there exist fundamental differences in fMRI signal composition patterns that can effectively classify the task states of tfMRl data, furthermore, whether there exist key functional components in characterizing the diverse tfMRl signals. Recently, fMRI signal composition patterns of multiple tasks have been investigated via deep learning models, where relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable and the neurologic meaning of their results is elusive. Thus, the major challenges arise from the high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, interindividual variability, a small sample size of fMRI data, and the explainability of classification results. To address the above challenges, we proposed a computational framework based on group-wise hybrid temporal and spatial sparse representations (HTSSR) to identify and differentiate multitask fMRI signal composition patterns. Using relatively small cohorts of Human Connectome Project (HCP) tfMRl data as test-bed, the experimental results demonstrated that the multitask of fMRI data can be successfully classified with an average accuracy of 96.67%, where the key components in differentiating the multitask can be characterized, suggesting the effectiveness and explainability of the proposed method. Moreover, both task-related components and resting-state networks (RSNs) can be reliably detected. Therefore, our study proposed a novel framework that identifies the interpretable and discriminative fMRI composition patterns and can be potentially applied for controlling fMRI data quality and inferring biomarkers in brain disorders with small sample neuroimaging datasets.

Extensive effort has been devoted to improving fMRI data quality, but in the last two decades, there is no consensus reached which technique is more effective. In this study, we developed a novel deep neural network for denoising fMRI data, named denoising neural network (DeNN). This deep neural network is 1) applicable without requiring externally recorded data to model noise; 2) spatially and temporally adaptive to the variability of noise in different brain regions at different time points; 3) automated to output denoised data without manual interference; 4) trained and applied on each subject separately and 5) insensitive to the repetition time (TR) of fMRI data. When we compared DeNN with a number of nuisance regression methods for denoising fMRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, only DeNN had connectivity for functionally uncorrelated regions close to zero and successfully identified unbiased correlations between the posterior cingulate cortex seed and multiple brain regions within the default mode network or task positive network. The whole brain functional connectivity maps computed with DeNN-denoised data are approximately three times as homogeneous as the functional connectivity maps computed with raw data. Furthermore, the improved homogeneity strengthens rather than weakens the statistical power of fMRI in detecting intrinsic functional differences between cognitively normal subjects and subjects with Alzheimer's disease.

The promise of awake behaving infant fMRI as a deep measure of cognition	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article							PATTERN COMPLETION; MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPUS; PERCEPTION; ORIGINS; SPACE	What are the contents of the infant mind? In the last decade, computational advances in fMRI have allowed researchers access to the internal representations of adults. Applied similarly in infants, fMRI stands to revolutionize our understanding of cognitive development. By measuring representations at their source, infant fMRI overcomes some of the limitations of behavioral measures. We discuss example domains where this approach could be fruitful, including episodic memory, semantic cognition, spatial representations, and theory of mind. In these and other areas, the richness of fMRI data could give new insight into how infants represent the world and potentially help resolve ongoing debates in developmental science.

To use olfaction for disease diagnosis, elucidating the standard olfactory functions in healthy humans is necessary. However, the olfactory function in the human brain is less frequently assessed because of methodological difficulties associated with olfactory-related cerebral areas. Using ultra-high fields (UHF), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with high spatial resolution and sensitivity may allow for the measurement of activation in the cerebral areas. This study aimed to apply 7-Tesla fMRI to assess olfactory function in the human brain by exposing individuals to four different odorants for 8 s. We found that olfactory stimulation mainly activated the piriform and orbitofrontal cortex in addition to the amygdala. Among these regions, univariate fMRI analysis indicated that subjective odor intensity significantly correlated with the averaged fMRI signals in the piriform cortex but not with subjective hedonic tone in any region. In contrast, multivariate fMRI analysis showed that subjective hedonic tone could be discriminated from the fMRI response patterns in the posterior orbitofrontal cortex. Thus, the piriform cortex is mainly associated with subjective odor intensity, whereas the posterior orbitofrontal cortex are involved in the discrimination of the subjective hedonic tone of the odorant. UHF-fMRI may be useful for assessing olfactory function in the human brain.

We hypothesized that the auditory noise of the scanner has an effect on autonomic activity. Methods: We measured heart rate variability (HRV) while exposing 30 healthy subjects to fMRI noise. In doing so, we demonstrated an increase in parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity compared to silence and white noise and a decrease in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity compared to white noise. Conclusions: The influence of MR scanner noise on the autonomic nervous system should be taken into account when performing fMRI experiments.

The patient underwent an in-depth neuroimaging and (neuro)psychological evaluation. Language networks in the frontotemporal-parietal areas were typically activated bilaterally through fMRI and MEG assessments based on task-based data. Resting-state fMRI showed preserved connectivity between language areas. An obsessive-compulsive personality profile and mild anxiety were found, suggesting psychological and psychiatric factors may be relevant. Accordingly with our findings, multimodal imaging is beneficial to understand FAS neurological and functional etiologies.

However, how the data provided by fMRI and EEG relate exactly to the underlying neural activity remains incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to understand the relation between EEG and fMRI data at the level of neural population codes using multivariate pattern analysis. In particular, we assessed whether this relation is affected when we change stimuli or introduce identity-preserving variations to them. For this, we recorded EEG and fMRI data separately from 21 healthy participants while participants viewed everyday objects in different viewing conditions, and then related the data to electrocorticogram (ECoG) data recorded for the same stimulus set from epileptic patients. The comparison of EEG and ECoG data showed that object category signals emerge swiftly in the visual system and can be detected by both EEG and ECoG at similar temporal delays after stimulus onset. The correlation between EEG and ECoG was reduced when object representations tolerant to changes in scale and orientation were considered. The comparison of fMRI and ECoG overall revealed a tighter relationship in occipital than in temporal regions, related to differences in fMRI signal-to-noise ratio. Together, our results reveal a complex relationship between fMRI, EEG, and ECoG signals at the level of population codes that critically depends on the time point after stimulus onset, the region investigated, and the visual contents used.

The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the commonly-used imaging modalities that can be used to understand human brain mechanisms as well as the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. The advances in artificial intelligence and the emergence of deep learning techniques have shown promising results to better interpret fMRI data. Deep learning techniques have rapidly become the state of the art for analyzing fMRI data sets and resulted in performance improvements in diverse fMRI applications. Deep learning is normally presented as an end-to-end learning process and can alleviate feature engineering requirements and hence reduce domain knowledge requirements to some extent. Under the framework of deep learning, fMRI data can be considered as images, time series or images series. Hence, different deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural network, or a combination of both, can be developed to process fMRI data for different tasks. In this review, we discussed the basics of deep learning methods and focused on its successful implementations for brain disorder diagnosis based on fMRI images. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of brain disorder diagnosis with fMRI images from the perspective of deep learning applications. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The low-frequency oscillations of the rs-fMRI signal demonstrate an intrinsic spatiotemporal organization in the brain (brain networks) that may relate to the underlying neural activity. In this review article, we briefly describe the current acquisition techniques for rs-fMRI data, from the most common approaches for resting state acquisition strategies, to more recent investigations with dedicated hardware and ultra-high fields. Specific sequences that allow very fast acquisitions, or multiple echoes, are discussed next. We then consider how acquisition methods weighted towards specific parts of the BOLD signal, like the Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) or Volume (CBV), can provide more spatially specific network information. These approaches are being developed alongside the commonly used BOLD-weighted acquisitions. Finally, specific applications of rs-fMRI to challenging regions such as the laminae in the neocortex, and the networks within the large areas of subcortical white matter regions are discussed. We finish the review with recommendations for acquisition strategies for a range of typical applications of resting state fMRI.	[Raimondo, Luisa; Oliveira, Icaro A.

Here, we studied the spatial and temporal correspondences between simultaneously acquired EEG microstate topologies and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) intrinsic networks in 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 14 healthy age and sex matched controls. We found an anteriorisation of EEG microstates' topologies in AD patients compared with controls; this corresponded with reduced spatial expression of default mode and increased expression of frontal lobe networks in rs-fMRI. In a hierarchical cluster analysis the time courses of the EEG microstates were associated with the time courses of spatially corresponding rs-fMRI networks. We found prevalent negative correlations of time courses between anterior microstate topologies and posterior rs-fMRI components as well as between posterior microstate topology and anterior rs-fMRI components. These negative correlations were significantly more expressed in controls than in AD patients. In conclusion, our data support the notion that the time courses of EEG microstates underlie the temporal expression of rs-fMRI networks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the anterior-to-posterior connectivity of microstates and rs-fMRI components may be reduced in AD, indicative of a break-down of long-reaching intrahemispheric connections.

Previous animal and human studies on epilepsy have reported that changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals induced by epileptic events could be used as diagnostic markers for EZ or SOZ localization. Si-multaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recording is gaining interest as a non-invasive tool for preoperative epilepsy evaluation. However, EEG-fMRI studies have reported inconsistent and ambiguous findings. Therefore, it remains unclear whether BOLD responses can be used for accurate EZ or SOZ localization. In this study, we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in a rat model of 4-aminopyridine-induced acute focal seizures to assess the spatial concordance between individual BOLD responses and the SOZ. This was to determine the optimal use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in the SOZ localization. We observed a high spatial consistency between BOLD responses and the SOZ. Further, dynamic BOLD responses were consistent with the regions where the seizures were propagated. These results suggested that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording could be used as a noninvasive clinical diagnostic technique for localizing the EZ or SOZ and could be an effective tool for mapping epileptic networks.

How the fMRI-ALFF relates to the amplitude in electrophysiological signals remains unclear. We here aimed to investigate the neural correlates of fMRI-ALFF by comparing the spatial difference of amplitude between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) states from fMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG), respectively. By synthesizing MEG signal into amplitude-based envelope time course, we first investigated 2 types of amplitude in MEG, meaning the amplitude of neural activities from delta to gamma (i.e. MEG-amplitude) and the amplitude of their low-frequency modulation at the fMRI range (i.e. MEG-ALFF). We observed that the MEG-ALFF in EC was increased at parietal sensors, ranging from alpha to beta; whereas the MEG-amplitude in EC was increased at the occipital sensors in alpha. Source-level analysis revealed that the increased MEG-ALFF in the sensorimotor cortex overlapped with the most reliable EC-EO differences observed in fMRI at slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz), and these differences were more significant after global mean standardization. Taken together, our results support that (i) the amplitude at 2 timescales in MEG reflect distinct physiological information and that (ii) the fMRI-ALFF may relate to the ALFF in neural activity.

However, data-driven technique like independent components analysis (ICA), can yield unstable and inconsistent results, confounding the true effects of interest and hindering the understanding of brain functionality and connectivity. A key contributing factor to this instability is the information loss that occurs during fMRI data reduction. Data reduction of high dimensionality fMRI data in the temporal domain to identify the important information within group datasets is necessary for such analyses and is crucial to ensure the accuracy and stability of the outputs. In this study, we describe an fMRI data reduction strategy based on an adapted neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) algorithm. Both simulated and real data results indicate that, compared with the widely used data reduction method, principal component analysis, the NPE-based data reduction method (a) shows superior performance on efficient data reduction, while enhancing group-level information, (b) develops a unique stratagem for selecting components based on an adjacency graph of eigenvectors, (c) generates more reliable and reproducible brain networks under different model orders when the outputs of NPE are used for ICA, (d) is more sensitive to revealing task-evoked activation for task fMRI, and (e) is extremely attractive and powerful for the increasingly popular fast fMRI and very large datasets.

However, it is unclear to whether preoperative brain mapping of both languages is needed. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of language task functional MRI (fMRI) implemented in both languages in bilingual patients. METHODS We retrospectively examined fMRI data of 13 bilingual brain tumor patients (age: 23 to 59 years) who performed antonym generation task-based fMRIs in English and non-English language. The usefulness of bilingual language mapping was evaluated using a structured survey administered to 5 neurosurgeons. Additionally, quantitative comparison between the brain activation maps of both languages was performed. RESULTS Survey responses revealed differences in raters' surgical approach, including asleep versus awake surgery and extent of resection, after viewing the language fMRI maps. Additional non-English fMRI led to changes in surgical decision-making and bettered localization of language areas. Quantitative analysis revealed an increase in laterality index (LI) in non-English fMRI compared to English fMRI. The Dice coefficient demonstrated fair overlap (.458 +/- .160) between the activation maps. CONCLUSION Bilingual fMRI mapping of bilingual patients allows to better appreciate functionally active language areas that may be neglected in single language mapping. Utility of bilingual mapping was supported by changes in both surgical approach and LI measurements, suggesting its benefit on preoperative language mapping.

FMRI examination along with neuropsychological testing might strengthen the diagnosis. We hypothesized that ADHD-adults with and without medication would show different fMRI pattern compared to healthy controls while testing tasks of motor inhibition and cognitive switching. Methods: 45 subjects in three age-matched groups: (1) controls, (2) ADHD-adults under medication (ADHD+) and (3) medication-naive adults with ADHD (ADHD-) underwent fMRI and neuropsychological testing. Group analysis and population-based statistics were performed. Results: DTVP-A, intellectual ability as well as attention capability, visual-perceptual and visual-motor abilities showed no significant differences between the groups. However, fMRI revealed statistically significant differences between the ADHD+, ADHD- and control groups on tasks of motor inhibition and cognitive switching on adults in bilateral fronto-striatal brain regions, inferior fronto-frontal, fronto-cingulate and fronto-parietal networks as well as in the parietal lobe (p < 0.05). Conclusions: fMRI offers the potential to differentiate between the ADHD+, ADHD- and control groups. FMRI possibly opens a new window for monitoring the therapeutic effect of ADHD medication.

Multisensory fMRI studies, which examine fMRI activities in response to various types of sensory stimulation, could help identify nociceptive-specific brain regions, but previous studies are limited by sample size and they did not differentiate nociceptive-specific regions and nociceptive-preferential regions, which have significantly larger responses to nociceptive input. In this study, we conducted a multisensory fMRI experiment on 80 healthy participants, with the aim to determine whether there are certain brain regions that specifically or preferentially respond to nociceptive stimulation. By comparing the evoked fMRI responses across four sensory modalities, we found a series of brain regions specifically or preferentially involved in nociceptive sensory input. Particularly, we found different parts of some cortical regions, such as insula and cingulate gyrus, play different functional roles in the processing of nociceptive stimulation. Hence, this multisensory study improves our understanding of the functional integrations and segregations of the nociceptive-related regions.

Rest-fMRI may replace or can be complementary to task-driven fMRI (t-fMRI), particularly in patients unable to cooperate with the task paradigm, such as children or sedated, paretic, aphasic patients. Although rest-fMRI is still under standardization, this technique has been demonstrated to be feasible and valuable in the routine clinical setting for neurosurgical planning, along with intraoperative electrocortical mapping. In the literature, there is growing evidence that rest-fMRI can provide valuable information for the depiction of glioma-related functional brain network impairment. Accordingly, rest-fMRI could allow a tailored glioma surgery improving the surgeon's ability to increase the extent of resection (EOR), and simultaneously minimize the risk of damage of eloquent brain structures and neuronal networks responsible for the integrity of executive functions. In this article, we present a review of the literature and illustrate the feasibility of rest-fMRI in the clinical setting for presurgical mapping of eloquent networks in patients affected by brain tumors, before and after tumor resection.

Quality control in resting-state fMRI: the benefits of visual inspection	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						artifacts; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); resting state-fMRI; reproducibility of results; quality control	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MOTION CORRECTION; HEAD MOTION; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; HUMAN BRAIN; ACQUISITION; MRI; RELIABILITY; REGRESSION; NETWORKS	Background A variety of quality control (QC) approaches are employed in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to determine data quality and ultimately inclusion or exclusion of a fMRI data set in group analysis. Reliability of rs-fMRI data can be improved by censoring or "scrubbing" volumes affected by motion. While censoring preserves the integrity of participant-level data, including excessively censored data sets in group analyses may add noise. Quantitative motion-related metrics are frequently reported in the literature; however, qualitative visual inspection can sometimes catch errors or other issues that may be missed by quantitative metrics alone. In this paper, we describe our methods for performing QC of rs-fMRI data using software-generated quantitative and qualitative output and trained visual inspection.Results The data provided for this QC paper had relatively low motion-censoring, thus quantitative QC resulted in no exclusions. Qualitative checks of the data resulted in limited exclusions due to potential incidental findings and failed pre-processing scripts.Conclusion Visual inspection in addition to the review of quantitative QC metrics is an important component to ensure high quality and accuracy in rs-fMRI data analysis.

Historically, language dominance has been determined using the intracarotid amobarbitol procedure (IAP), but use of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanning is becoming more common. Few studies examine the correspondence between fMRI and IAP in pediatric samples. The current study examined the agreement of hemispheric lateralization as determined by fMRI and IAP in a consecutive sample of 10 pediatric patients with epilepsy evaluated for epilepsy surgery. Data showed a strong correlation between IAP and fMRI lateralilty indices (r = .91) and 70% agreement in determination of hemispheric dominance, despite increased demonstration of bilateral or atypical language representation in this pediatric sample. Clinical implications and interpretation challenges are discussed. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Unlike existing MS-DL algorithms that ignore fMRI data's prior information, it is formulated as a penalized plus constrained rank-1 matrix approximation, where l(1) norm-based adaptive sparse penalty, l(0) norm-based dictionary regularization, and lag-1 based autocorrelation maximization have been introduced in the minimization problem. Besides, spatial dependence among neighbouring voxels has been exploited for fine-tuning the sparsity parameters. To my best knowledge, the sgBACES algorithm is the first to effectively take temporal and spatial prior information into account for an MS-fMRI-DL framework. It also has the advantage of not requiring a separate sparse coding stage. Studies based on synthetic and experimental fMRI datasets are used to compare the performance of sgBACES with the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of correlation strength and computation time. It emerged that the proposed sgBACES algorithm enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recovered time courses (TCs) and the precision of the recovered spatial maps (SMs). A 10.2% increase in the mean correlation value over the ShSSDL algorithm is observed for motor-task based fMRI data.

However, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for investigating whole-brain dynamics during behavior and task engagement, concurrent measures of alertness (such as EEG or pupillometry) are often unavailable. Here, we extract a continuous, time-resolved marker of alertness from fMRI data alone. We demonstrate that this fMRI alertness marker, calculated in a short pre-stimulus interval, captures trial-to-trial behavioral responses to incoming sensory stimuli. In addition, we find that the prediction of both EEG and behavioral responses during the task may be accomplished using only a small fraction of fMRI voxels. Furthermore, we observe that accounting for alertness appears to increase the statistical detection of task-activated brain areas. These findings have broad implications for augmenting a large body of existing datasets with information about ongoing arousal states, enriching fMRI studies of neural variability in health and disease.

Functional MRI (fMRI) is clinically used for localization of eloquent cortex before surgical intervention, most commonly motor and language function in patients with tumors or epilepsy. In the pediatric population, special considerations for fMRI relate to limited examination tolerance, small head size, developing anatomy and physiology, and diverse potential abnormalities. In this article, we will highlight pearls and pitfalls of clinical pediatric fMRI including blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging principles, patient preparation, study acquisition, data postprocessing, and examination interpretation. CONCLUSION. Clinical fMRI is indicated for presurgical localization of eloquent cortex in patients with tumors, epilepsy, or other neurologic conditions and requires a solid understanding of technical considerations and data processing. In children, special approaches are needed for patient preparation as well as study design, acquisition, and interpretation. Radiologists should be cognizant of developmental neuroanatomy, causes of neuropathology, and capacity for neuroplasticity in the pediatric population.

Higher and deeper: Bringing layer fMRI to association cortex	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Layer fMRI; Association cortex; Cognition; Predictive coding; Cortical depth; High resolution	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; ANALYSIS STRATEGIES; CORTICAL DEPTH; IMAGERY; MODEL; DYSFUNCTION; PERCEPTION	Recent advances in fMRI have enabled non-invasive measurements of brain function in awake, behaving humans at unprecedented spatial resolutions, allowing us to separate activity in distinct cortical layers. While most layer fMRI studies to date have focused on primary cortices, we argue that the next big steps forward in our understanding of cognition will come from expanding this technology into higher-order association cortex, to characterize depth-dependent activity during increasingly sophisticated mental processes. We outline phenomena and theories ripe for investigation with layer fMRI, including perception and imagery, selective attention, and predictive coding. We discuss practical and theoretical challenges to cognitive applications of layer fMRI, including localizing regions of interest in the face of substantial anatomical heterogeneity across individuals, designing appropriate task paradigms within the confines of acquisition parameters, and generating hypotheses for higher-order brain regions where the laminar circuitry is less well understood. We consider how applying layer fMRI in association cortex may help inform computational models of brain function as well as shed light on consciousness and mental illness, and issue a call to arms to our fellow methodologists and neuroscientists to bring layer fMRI to this next frontier.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) requires thresholds by which to identify brain regions with significant activation, particularly for experiments involving real-life paradigms. One conventional non-parametric approach to generating surrogate data involves decomposition of the original fMRI time series using the Fourier transform, after which the phase is randomized without altering the magnitude of individual frequency components. However, it has been reported that spontaneous brain signals could be non-stationary, which, if true, could lead to false-positive results. Approach. This paper introduces a randomization procedure based on the Hilbert-Huang transform by which to account for non-stationarity in fMRI time series derived from two fMRI datasets (stationary or non-stationary). The significance of individual voxels was determined by comparing the distribution of empirical data versus a surrogate distribution. Main results. In a comparison with conventional phase-randomization and wavelet-based permutation methods, the proposed method proved highly effective in generating activation maps indicating essential brain regions, while filtering out noise in the white matter. Significance. This work demonstrated the importance of considering the non-stationary nature of fMRI time series when selecting resampling methods by which to probe brain activity or identify functional networks in real-life fMRI experiments. We propose a statistical testing method to deal with the non-stationarity of continuous brain signals.

However, olfaction fMRI lags behind vision and audition fMRI for 2 primary reasons: First, the olfactory brain areas are particularly susceptible to imaging artifacts, and second, the olfactory stimulus is particularly difficult to control in the fMRI environment. A component of the latter is related to the odorant delivery human-machine interface, namely the point where odorants exit the dispensing apparatus to reach at the nose. Previous approaches relied on either nasal cannulas or nasal masks, each associated with particular drawbacks and discomforts. Here, we provide detailed descriptions and instructions for transforming the MRI head-coil into an olfactory microenvironment, or odor canopy, where odorants can be switched on and off in less than 150 ms without cannula or mask. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate that odor canopy provides for clearly dissociable odorant presence and absence, with no nonolfactory cues. Moreover, we find that odor canopy is rated more comfortable than nasal mask, and we demonstrate that using odor canopy in the fMRI generates a typical olfactory brain response. We conclude in recommending this approach for minimized discomfort in fMRI of olfaction.

NF approaches typically rely on a single modality, such as electroencephalography (EEG-NF) or a brain imaging technique, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-NF). The introduction of simultaneous EEG-fMRI tools has opened up the possibility of combining the high temporal resolution of EEG with the high spatial resolution of fMRI, thereby increasing the accuracy of NF. However, only a few studies have actively combined both techniques. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of EEG-fMRI-NF studies (N = 17) to identify the potential and effectiveness of this non-invasive treatment for neurological conditions. The systematic review revealed a lack of homogeneity among the studies, including sample sizes, acquisition methods in terms of simultaneity of the two procedures (unimodal EEG-NF and fMRI-NF), therapeutic targets field, and the number of sessions. Indeed, because most studies are based on a single session of NF, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the therapeutic efficacy of NF. Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand non-clinical and clinical potential of EEG-fMRI-NF.

Since breathing and heart beating can cause fluctuations in the fMRI signal, these physiological activities may affect the fMRI data differently between AD patients and healthy participants. We collected resting-state fMRI data from AD patients and age-matched healthy participants. With concurrent cardiac and respiratory recordings, we estimated both physiological responses phase-locked and non-phase-locked to heart beating and breathing. We found that the cardiac and respiratory physiological responses in AD patients were 3.00 +/- 0.51 s and 3.96 +/- 0.52 s later (both p < 0.0001) than those in healthy participants, respectively. After correcting the physiological noise in the resting-state fMRI data by population-specific physiological response functions, the DMN estimated by seed-correlation was more localized to the seed region. The DMN difference between AD patients and healthy controls became insignificant after suppressing physiological noise. Our results indicate the importance of controlling physiological noise in the resting-state fMRI analysis to obtain clinically related characterizations in AD.

Brain activity signals can be recorded during the alternate performance of given tasks, that is, task fMRI (tfMRI), or during resting-state, that is, resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), as a measure of baseline brain activity. This contributes to the understanding of how the human brain is organized in functionally distinct subdivisions. fMRI experiments from high-resolution scans provide hundred of thousands of longitudinal signals for each individual, corresponding to brain activity measurements over each voxel of the brain along the duration of the experiment. In this context, we propose novel visualization techniques for high-dimensional functional data relying on depth-based notions that enable computationally efficient 2-dim representations of fMRI data, which elucidate sample composition, outlier presence, and individual variability. We believe that this previous step is crucial to any inferential approach willing to identify neuroscientific patterns across individuals, tasks, and brain regions. We present the proposed technique via an extensive simulation study, and demonstrate its application on a motor and language tfMRI experiment.

Jean			Vascular origins of low-frequency oscillations in the cerebrospinal fluid signal in resting-state fMRI: Interpretation using photoplethysmography	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						arterial BOLD; cerebrospinal fluid; functional connectivity; heart-rate variability; Mayer wave; photoplethysmograph; pulse-intensity ratio; resting-state fMRI; second derivative of PPG; vasomotion; venous BOLD	END-TIDAL CO2; BLOOD-PRESSURE; MAYER WAVES; HEART-RATE; CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; ARTERIAL PULSATIONS; CUFF-LESS; B-WAVES; BOLD	In vivo mapping of cerebrovascular oscillations in the 0.05-0.15 Hz remains difficult. Oscillations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represent a possible avenue for noninvasively tracking these oscillations using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and have been used to correct for vascular oscillations in rs-fMRI functional connectivity. However, the relationship between low-frequency CSF and vascular oscillations remains unclear. In this study, we investigate this relationship using fast simultaneous rs-fMRI and photoplethysmogram (PPG), examining the 0.1 Hz PPG signal, heart-rate variability (HRV), pulse-intensity ratio (PIR), and the second derivative of the PPG (SDPPG). The main findings of this study are: (a) signals in different CSF regions are not equivalent in their associations with vascular and tissue rs-fMRI signals; (b) the PPG signal is maximally coherent with the arterial and CSF signals at the cardiac frequency, but coherent with brain tissue at similar to 0.2 Hz; (c) PIR is maximally coherent with the CSF signal near 0.03 Hz; and (d) PPG-related vascular oscillations only contribute to es similar to 15% of the CSF (and arterial) signal in rs-fMRI. These findings caution against averaging all CSF regions when extracting physiological nuisance regressors in rs-fMRI applications, and indicate the drivers of the CSF signal are more than simply cardiac. Our study is an initial attempt at the refinement and standardization of how the CSF signal in rs-fMRI can be used and interpreted. It also paves the way for using rs-fMRI in the CSF as a potential tool for tracking cerebrovascular health through, for instance, the potential relationship between PIR and the CSF signal.

Here, we present Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic fMRI data designed to facilitate the adoption of robust and generalizable research practices. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to automatically annotate stimuli from dozens of fMRI studies using naturalistic stimuli-such as movies and narratives-allowing researchers to easily test neuroscientific hypotheses across multiple ecologically-valid datasets. In addition, Neuroscout builds on a robust ecosystem of open tools and standards to provide an easy-to-use analysis builder and a fully automated execution engine that reduce the burden of reproducible research. Through a series of meta-analytic case studies, we validate the automatic feature extraction approach and demonstrate its potential to support more robust fMRI research. Owing to its ease of use and a high degree of automation, Neuroscout makes it possible to overcome modeling challenges commonly arising in naturalistic analysis and to easily scale analyses within and across datasets, democratizing generalizable fMRI research.

J	Scrivener, CL				Scrivener, Catriona L.			When Is Simultaneous Recording Necessary? A Guide for Researchers Considering Combined EEG-fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						simultaneous EEG and fMRI; multimodal neuroimaging; EEG-informed fMRI; fMRI-informed EEG; combined recording	VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BOLD RESPONSES; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; ARTIFACT; MRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM; ACQUISITION; INTEGRATION	Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide non-invasive measures of brain activity at varying spatial and temporal scales, offering different views on brain function for both clinical and experimental applications. Simultaneous recording of these measures attempts to maximize the respective strengths of each method, while compensating for their weaknesses. However, combined recording is not necessary to address all research questions of interest, and experiments may have greater statistical power to detect effects by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in separate recording sessions. While several existing papers discuss the reasons for or against combined recording, this article aims to synthesize these arguments into a flow chart of questions that researchers can consider when deciding whether to record EEG and fMRI separately or simultaneously. Given the potential advantages of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, the aim is to provide an initial overview of the most important concepts and to direct readers to relevant literature that will aid them in this decision.

A clinically applicable functional MRI memory paradigm for use with pediatric patients	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						fMRI; Hippocampus; Epilepsy surgery; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Tumor	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; EPISODIC FUTURE THINKING; VERBAL MEMORY; LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; WADA TEST; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; FMRI; HIPPOCAMPAL; CHILDREN	Objective: Clinically employable functional MRI (fMRI) memory paradigms are not yet established for pediatric patient epilepsy surgery workups. Seeking to establish such a paradigm, we evaluated the effectiveness of memory fMRI tasks we developed by quantifying individual activation in a clinical pediatric setting, analyzing patterns of activation relative to the side of temporal lobe (TL) pathology, and comparing fMRI and Wada test results. Methods: We retrospectively identified 72 patients aged 6.7-20.9 years with pathology (seizure focus and/or tumor) limited to the TL who had attempted memory and language fMRI tasks over a 9-year period as part of presurgical workups. Memory fMRI tasks required visualization of autobiographical memories in a block design alternating with covert counting. Language fMRI protocols involved verb and sentence generation. Scans were both qualitatively interpreted and quantitatively assessed for blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal change using region of interest (ROI) masks. We calculated the percentage of successfully scanned individual cases, compared 2 memory task activation masks in cases with left versus right TL pathology, and compared fMRI with Wada tests when available. Patients who had viable fMRI and Wada tests had generally concordant results. Results: Of the 72 cases, 60 (83%), aged 7.6-20.9 years, successfully performed the memory fMRI tasks and 12 (17%) failed. Eleven of 12 unsuccessful scans were due to motion and/or inability to perform the tasks, and the success of a twelfth was indeterminate due to orthodontic metal artifact. Seven of the successful 60 cases had distorted anatomy that precluded employing predetermined masks for quantitative analysis. Successful fMRI memory studies showed bilateral mesial temporal activation and quantitatively demonstrated: (1) left activation (L-ACT) less than right activation (R-ACT) in cases with left temporal lobe (L-TL) pathology, (2) nonsignificant R-ACT less than L-ACT in cases with right temporal lobe (R-TL) pathology, and (3) lower L-ACT plus R-ACT activation for cases with L-TL versus R-TL pathology. Patients who had viable fMRI and Wada tests had generally concordant results. Significance: This study demonstrates evidence of an fMRI memory task paradigm that elicits reliable activation at the individual level and can generally be accomplished in clinically involved pediatric patients. This autobiographical memory paradigm showed activation in mesial TL structures, and cases with left compared to right TL pathology showed differences in activation consistent with extant literature in TL epilepsy. Further studies will be required to assess outcome prediction. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this research, we examined 9.4 T BOLD fMRI responses to visual stimuli of varying pulse durations (1 - 50 ms) and temporal frequencies (1 - 10 Hz) under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia, and compared fMRI responses of anesthetized and awake mice. Under anesthesia, significant positive BOLD responses were detected bilaterally in the major structures of the visual pathways, including the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, superior colliculus, lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus, primary visual area, and higher-order visual area. BOLD responses increased slightly with pulse duration, were maximal at 3 - 5 Hz stimulation, and significantly decreased at 10 Hz, which were all consistent with previous neurophysiological findings. When the mice were awake, the BOLD fMRI response was faster in all active regions and stronger in the subcortical areas compared with the anesthesia condition. In the V1, the BOLD response was biphasic for 5 Hz stimulation and negative for 10 Hz stimulation under wakefulness, whereas prolonged positive BOLD responses were observed at both frequencies under anesthesia. Unexpected activation was detected in the extrastriate postrhinal area and non-visual subiculum complex under anesthesia, but not under wakefulness. Widespread positive BOLD activity under anesthesia likely results from the disinhibition and sensitization of excitatory neurons induced by ketamine. Overall, fMRI can be a viable tool for mapping brain-wide functional networks.

Decoding Task-Based fMRI Data with Graph Neural Networks, Considering Individual Differences	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						task fMRI; brain decoding; classification; graph convolutional network; human connectome project	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FLUID INTELLIGENCE	Task fMRI provides an opportunity to analyze the working mechanisms of the human brain during specific experimental paradigms. Deep learning models have increasingly been applied for decoding and encoding purposes study to representations in task fMRI data. More recently, graph neural networks, or neural networks models designed to leverage the properties of graph representations, have recently shown promise in task fMRI decoding studies. Here, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional network (GCN) framework with three convolutional layers to classify task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project dataset. We compared the predictive performance of our GCN model across four of the most widely used node embedding algorithms-NetMF, RandNE, Node2Vec, and Walklets-to automatically extract the structural properties of the nodes in the functional graph. The empirical results indicated that our GCN framework accurately predicted individual differences (0.978 and 0.976) with the NetMF and RandNE embedding methods, respectively. Furthermore, to assess the effects of individual differences, we tested the classification performance of the model on sub-datasets divided according to gender and fluid intelligence. Experimental results indicated significant differences in the classification predictions of gender, but not high/low fluid intelligence fMRI data. Our experiments yielded promising results and demonstrated the superior ability of our GCN in modeling task fMRI data.

However, the fMRI signals are complex in addition to being noisy, so fMRI still faces limitations for clinical applications. Here we review methods that have been proposed as potential solutions so far, namely statistical, biophysical and decoding models, with their strengths and weaknesses. We especially evaluate the ability of these models to directly predict clinical variables from their parameters (predictability) and to extract clinically relevant information regarding biological mechanisms and relevant features for classification and prediction (interpretability). We then provide guidelines for useful applications and pitfalls of such fMRI-based models in a clinical research context, looking beyond the current state of the art. In particular, we argue that the clinical relevance of fMRI calls for a new generation of models for fMRI data, which combine the strengths of both biophysical and decoding models. This leads to reliable and biologically meaningful model parameters, which thus fulfills the need for simultaneous inter-pretability and predictability. In our view, this synergy is fundamental for the discovery of new pharmacological and interventional targets, as well as the use of models as biomarkers in neurology and psychiatry.

Emerging evidence in adults with epilepsy suggests that material-specific fMRI paradigms can predict postoperative memory outcomes, however these paradigms are not suitable for children. In pediatric age, the use of memory fMRI paradigms designed for adults is complicated by the effect of developmental stages in cognitive maturation, the impairment experienced by some people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the normal representation of memory function during development, which may differ from adults. We present a memory fMRI paradigm designed to activate mesial temporal lobe structures that is brief, independent of reading ability, and therefore a novel candidate for use in children. Data from 33 adults and 19 children (all healthy controls) show that the paradigm captures the expected leftward asymmetry of mesial temporal activation in adults. A more symmetrical pattern was observed in children, consistent with the progressive emergence of hemispheric specialisation across childhood. These data have important implications for the interpretation of presurgical memory fMRI in the pediatric setting. They also highlight the need to carefully consider the impact of cognitive development on fMRI tools used in clinical practice.

Its ability to examine brain activity during the resting state without the need for explicit tasks or stimuli has made it an integral component of brain imaging studies. In recent years, rs-fMRI has witnessed substantial growth and found widespread application in the investigation of functional connectivity within the brain. To delineate the developmental trajectory of rs-fMRI over the past two decades, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using bibliometric tool Citespace. Our analysis encompassed publication trends, authorship networks, institutional affiliations, international collaborations, as well as emergent themes in references and keywords. Our study reveals a remarkable increase in the volume of rs-fMRI publications over the past two decades, underscoring the burgeoning interest and potential within this field. Harvard University stands out as the institution with the highest number of research papers published in the realm of RS-fMRI, while the United States holds the highest overall influence in this domain. The recent emergence of keywords such as "machine learning" and "default mode," coupled with citation surges in reference to rs-fMRI, have paved new avenues for research within this field. Our study underscores the critical importance of integrating machine learning techniques into rs-fMRI investigations, offering valuable insights into brain function and disease diagnosis. These findings hold profound significance for the field of neuroscience and may furnish insights for future research employing rs-fMRI as a diagnostic tool for a wide array of neurological disorders, thus emphasizing its pivotal role and potential as a tool for investigating brain functionality.

However, their application in the presurgical setting requires significant time and effort and increased costs, thereby raising questions regarding efficiency and best use. In this work, we set out to evaluate DTI-tractography and combined fMRI/DTI-tractography during intra-operative neuronavigation in resective brain surgery using lesion-related preoperative neurological deficit (PND) outcomes as metrics. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 252 consecutive patients admitted for brain surgery. Standard anatomical neuroimaging protocols were performed in 127 patients, 69 patients had additional DTI-tractography, and 56 had combined DTI-tractography/fMRI. fMRI procedures involved language, motor, somatic sensory, sensorimotor and visual mapping. DTI-tractography involved fiber tracking of the motor, sensory, language and visual pathways. At 1 month postoperatively, DTI-tractography patients were more likely to present either improvement or preservation of PNDs (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively). At 6 months, combined DTI-tractography/fMRI patients were more likely to experience complete PND resolution (p < 0.001). Low-grade lesion patients (N = 102) with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI were more likely to experience complete resolution of PNDs at 1 and 6 months (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). High-grade lesion patients (N = 140) with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI were more likely to have PNDs resolved at 6 months (p = 0.005). Patients with motor symptoms (N = 80) were more likely to experience complete remission of PNDs at 6 months with DTI-tractography or combined DTI-tractography/fMRI (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004, respectively), without significant difference between the two imaging protocols (p = 1). Patients with sensory symptoms (N = 44) were more likely to experience complete PND remission at 6 months with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI (p = 0.004). The intraoperative neuroimaging modality did not have a significant effect in patients with preoperative seizures (N = 47).

These resting-state activity networks can be informative when diagnosing various neurodevelopmental diseases, but only if the images are high quality. The quality of an rs-fMRI rapidly degrades when the patient moves during the scan. Herein, we describe how patient motion impacts an rs-fMRI on multiple levels. We begin with how the electromagnetic field and pulses of an MR scanner interact with a patient's physiology, how movement affects the net signal acquired by the scanner, and how motion can be quantified from rs-fMRI. We then present methods for preventing motion through educational and behavioral interventions appropriate for different age groups, techniques for prospectively monitoring and correcting motion during the acquisition process, and pipelines for mitigating the effects of motion in existing scans.

Real time functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) uses sensory feedback to operantly reinforce patterns of neural response. It can be used, for example, to alter visual perception, increase brain connectivity, and reduce depression symptoms. Within recent years, interest in rt-fMRI-NF in both research and clinical contexts has expanded considerably. As such, building a consensus regarding best practices is of great value. Objective: This systematic review is designed to describe and evaluate the variations in methodology used in previous rt-fMRI-NF studies to provide recommendations for rt-fMRI-NF study designs that are mostly likely to elicit reproducible and consistent effects of neurofeedback. Methods: We conducted a database search for fMRI neurofeedback papers published prior to September 26th, 2019. Of 558 studies identified, 146 met criteria for inclusion. The following information was collected from each study: sample size and type, task used, neurofeedback calculation, regulation procedure, feedback, whether feedback was explicitly related to changing brain activity, feedback timing, control group for active neurofeedback, how many runs and sessions of neurofeedback, if a follow-up was conducted, and the results of neurofeedback training. Results: rt-fMRI-NF is typically upregulation practice based on hemodynamic response from a specific region of the brain presented using a continually updating thermometer display. Most rt-fMRI-NF studies are conducted in healthy samples and half evaluate its effect on immediate changes in behavior or affect. The most popular control group method is to provide sham signal from another region; however, many studies do not compare use a comparison group. Conclusions: We make several suggestions for designs of future rt-fMRI-NF studies. Researchers should use feedback calculation methods that consider neural response across regions (i.e., SVM or connectivity), which should be conveyed as intermittent, auditory feedback. Participants should be given explicit instructions and should be assessed on individual differences. Future rt-fMRI-NF studies should use clinical samples; effectiveness of rt-fMRI-NF should be evaluated on clinical/behavioral outcomes at follow-up time points in comparison to both a sham and no feedback control group.

Among different neuroimaging modalities, prediction using functional connectivity (FC) has shown great promise. Most literature has focused on prediction using static FC, with limited investigations on the merits of such analysis compared to prediction using dynamic FC or region-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) times series that encode temporal variability. To account for the temporal dynamics in fMRI, we propose a bi-directional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) approach that incorporates feature selection mechanism. The proposed pipeline is implemented via an efficient algorithm and applied for predicting intelligence using region-level time series and dynamic FC. We compare the prediction performance using different fMRI features acquired from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study involving nearly 7000 individuals. Our detailed analysis illustrates the consistently inferior performance of static FC compared to region-level time series or dynamic FC for single and combined rest and task fMRI experiments. The joint analysis of task and rest fMRI leads to improved intelligence prediction under all models compared to using fMRI from only one experiment. In addition, the proposed bi-LSTM pipeline based on region-level time series identifies several shared and differential important brain regions across fMRI experiments that drive intelligence prediction. A test-retest analysis of the selected regions shows strong reliability across cross-validation folds. Given the large sample size of ABCD study, our results provide strong evidence that superior prediction of intelligence can be achieved by accounting for temporal variations in fMRI.

In this study, by applying omics analysis strategy to rs-fMRI with exhaustive regional parameters, we proposed a novel approach, named Regional Parameter of Resting-state fMRI-omics (RP-Rs-fMRIomics), and further evaluated the diagnosis performance of the method on brain gliomas. We found that the RP-Rs-fMRIomics, featuring entire investigation and high interpretability, presented superior performance in prediction of tumor grade, IDH genotype and prognosis of brain gliomas. This RP-Rs-fMRIomics not only contributed a new imaging method for brain glioma research, but also expanded the clinical application of rs-fMRI. Rs-fMRI can provide rich information about functional processes in the brain with a large array of imaging parameters and is also suitable for investigating the biological processes in cerebral gliomas. We aimed to propose an imaging analysis method of RP-Rs-fMRIomics by adopting omics analysis on rs-fMRI with exhaustive regional parameters and subsequently estimating its feasibility on the prediction diagnosis of gliomas. In this retrospective study, preoperative rs-fMRI data were acquired from patients confirmed with diffuse gliomas (n = 176). A total of 420 features were extracted through measuring 14 regional parameters of rs-fMRI as much as available currently in 10 specific narrow frequency bins and three parts of gliomas. With a randomly split training and testing dataset (ratio 7:3), four classifiers were implemented to construct and optimize RP-Rs-fMRIomics models for predicting glioma grade, IDH status and Karnofsky Performance Status scores. The RP-Rs-fMRIomics models (AUROC 0.988, 0.905, 0.801) were superior to the corresponding traditional single rs-fMRI index (AUROC 0.803, 0.731, 0.632) in predicting glioma grade, IDH and survival. The RP-Rs-fMRIomics analysis, featuring high interpretability, was competitive for prediction of glioma grading, IDH genotype and prognosis. The method expanded the clinical application of rs-fMRI and also contributed a new imaging analysis for brain tumor research.

Defining Individual -Specific Functional Neuroanatomy for Precision Psychiatry	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Brain networks; fMRI; Functional connectivity; Individual differences; Precision imaging; Reliability	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; BRAIN NETWORKS; COGNITIVE-CONTROL; DEFAULT MODE; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY; AREAL ORGANIZATION; HUMAN CONNECTOME; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUBS; MRI	Studies comparing diverse groups have shown that many psychiatric diseases involve disruptions across distributed large-scale networks of the brain. There is hope that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity techniques will shed light on these disruptions, providing prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers as well as targets for therapeutic interventions. However, to date, progress on clinical translation of fMRI methods has been limited. Here, we argue that this limited translation is driven by a combination of intersubject heterogeneity and the relatively low reliability of standard fMRI techniques at the individual level. We review a potential solution to these limitations: the use of new "precision" fMRI approaches that shift the focus of analysis from groups to single individuals through the use of extended data acquisition strategies. We begin by discussing the potential advantages of fMRI functional connectivity methods for improving our understanding of functional neuroanatomy and disruptions in psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the budding field of precision fMRI and findings garnered from this work. We demonstrate that precision fMRI can improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures, while showing high stability and sensitivity to individual differences. We close by discussing the application of these approaches to clinical settings.

With a prevalence of 2-4% in adults, DOAs are significant disorders that are currently gaining attention among physicians. The paper describes a simultaneous EEG and fMRI experiment conducted in adult individuals with DOAs (n=10). Both EEG and fMRI data were validated by reproducing well established EEG and fMRI associations. A method for identification of both brain functional areas and EEG rhythms associated with DOAs in shallow sleep was designed. Significant differences between patients and controls were found in delta, theta, and alpha bands during awakening epochs. General linear models of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal have shown the secondary visual cortex and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex to be associated with alpha spectral power fluctuations, and the precuneus with delta spectral power fluctuations, specifically in patients and not in controls. Future EEG-fMRI sleep studies should also consider subject comfort as an important aspect in the experimental design.

Independent component analysis: a reliable alternative to general linear model for task-based fMRI	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						language mapping; fMRI; ICA; GLM; presurgical evaluation; neuroimaging; brain mapping; epilepsy	FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; LANGUAGE FMRI; REGISTRATION; ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS; ACCURATE; BOLD	Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable tool for the presurgical evaluation of patients undergoing neurosurgeries. Although many pre-processing steps have been modified according to advances in recent years, statistical analysis has remained largely the same since the first days of fMRI. In this study, we examined the ability of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate the activation of a language task in fMRI, and we compared it with the results of the General Lineal Model (GLM). Methods: Sixty patients undergoing evaluation for brain surgery due to various brain lesions and/or epilepsy and 20 control subjects completed an fMRI language mapping protocol that included three tasks, resulting in 259 fMRI scans. Depending on brain lesion characteristics, patients were allocated to (1) static/chronic not-expanding lesions (Group 1) and (2) progressive/expanding lesions (Group 2). GLM and ICA statistical maps were evaluated by fMRI experts to assess the performance of each technique. Results: In the control group, ICA and GLM maps were similar without any superiority of either technique. In Group 1 and Group 2, ICA performed statistically better than GLM, with a p-value of < 0.01801 and < 0.0237, respectively. This indicated that ICA performs as well as GLM when the subjects are able to cooperate well (less movement, good task performance), but ICA could outperform GLM in the patient groups. When both techniques were combined, 240 out of 259 scans produced reliable results, showing that the sensitivity of task-based fMRI can be increased when both techniques are integrated with the clinical setup. Conclusion: ICA may be slightly more advantageous, compared to GLM, in patients with brain lesions, across the range of pathologies included in our population and independent of symptoms chronicity. Our findings suggest that GLM analysis may be more susceptible to brain activity perturbations induced by a variety of lesions or scanner-induced artifacts due to motion or other factors. In our research, we demonstrated that ICA is able to provide fMRI results that can be used in surgery, taking into account patient and task-wise aspects that differ from those when fMRI is used in research.

Studies in animals and humans have provided insights of sleep at vastly different spatiotemporal scales. However, challenges remain to integrate local and global information of sleep. Therefore, we developed sleep fMRI based on simultaneous electrophysiology at 9.4 T in male mice. Optimized un-anesthetized mouse fMRI setup allowed manifestation of NREM and REM sleep, and a large sleep fMRI dataset was collected and openly accessible. State dependent global patterns were revealed, and state transitions were found to be global, asymmetrical and sequential, which can be predicted up to 17.8 s using LSTM models. Importantly, sleep fMRI with hippocampal recording revealed potentiated sharp-wave ripple triggered global patterns during NREM than awake state, potentially attributable to co-occurrence of spindle events. To conclude, we established mouse sleep fMRI with simultaneous electrophysiology, and demonstrated its capability by revealing global dynamics of state transitions and neural events. Mechanisms of sleep remain elusive. Here, authors developed mouse sleep fMRI based on simultaneous electrophysiology and mapped global and sequential state transition patterns, together with global patterns triggered by SWRs in NREM and awake states.

But along with the potential of fMRI to shed light on neurological, psychiatric, and psychological processes, there are methodological challenges and criticisms. Aim: We herein provide an fMRI primer designed for a diverse audience, from the neuroimaging novice to the experienced user. Methods: This primer is structured as follows: Part 1: Overview: "What is fMRI and what can it tell us?." Part 2: Basic fMRI principles: MR physics, the BOLD signal, and components of a typical scan session. Part 3: Basic fMRI experimental design: why timing is critical, and common sources of noise in the signal. Part 4: Basic fMRI analysis methods: software, the 3 stages of data analysis (preprocessing, individual, and group level), and a survey of advanced topics and methods including connectivity, machine learning, and assessing statistical significance. Part 5: Criticism, crises, and opportunities related to power of studies, computing requirements, logistical, and interpretational challenges, and methodological debate (assessing causality, circular correlations, and open science best practices). Outcomes n/a Clinical Translation: fMRI has primarily been used in clinical research to elucidate the brain correlates of sexual behavior. The translational potential of the method into clinical practice has not yet been realizedfMRI has primarily been used in clinical research to elucidate the brain correlates of sexual behavior. The translational potential of the method into clinical practice has not yet been realized Strengths and Limitations: fMRI is a useful and powerful tool for understanding the brain basis of human sexuality. However, it is also expensive, requires extensive methods expertise, and lacks the precision needed to be immediately translatable to clinical practice. The recency of the method, need for basic research, technical limitations, as well as inherent variability in individuals brain activity also impact the pace at which fMRI for sexual medicine can move from the scanner to the clinic. Conclusion: This primer provides the novice an understanding of the appropriate uses and limitations of fMRI, and for the experienced user, a concise update on current issues and methodological advances.

This method holds a great promise for studying individual vari-ability in brain function without the need to perform highly demanding tasks. However, in order to be broadly used, prediction models must prove to generalize beyond the dataset they were trained on. In this work, we test the generalizability of prediction of task-fMRI from rs-fMRI across sites, MRI vendors and age-groups. Moreover, we investigate the data requirements for successful prediction. We use the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset to explore how different combinations of training sample sizes and number of fMRI datapoints affect prediction success in various cognitive tasks. We then apply models trained on HCP data to predict brain acti-vations in data from a different site, a different MRI vendor (Phillips vs. Siemens scanners) and a different age group (children from the HCP-development project). We demonstrate that, depending on the task, a training set of approximately 20 participants with 100 fMRI timepoints each yields the largest gain in model performance. Nevertheless, further increasing sample size and number of timepoints results in significantly improved predic-tions, until reaching approximately 450-600 training participants and 800-1000 timepoints. Overall, the number of fMRI timepoints influences prediction success more than the sample size. We further show that models trained on adequate amounts of data successfully generalize across sites, vendors and age groups and provide predictions that are both accurate and individual-specific. These findings suggest that large-scale publicly available datasets may be utilized to study brain function in smaller, unique samples.

Bayesian fusion and multimodal DCM for EEG and fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multimodal data; Bayesian belief updating; Dynamic causal modelling; Canonical microcircuit neural mass model; Information gain	EVOKED-RESPONSES; CANONICAL MICROCIRCUITS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; EEG/FMRI FUSION; BRAIN NETWORK; MODEL; INFORMATION; CONNECTIVITY; INTEGRATION	This paper asks whether integrating multimodal EEG and fMRI data offers a better characterisation of functional brain architectures than either modality alone. This evaluation rests upon a dynamic causal model that generates both EEG and fMRI data from the same neuronal dynamics. We introduce the use of Bayesian fusion to provide informative (empirical) neuronal priors - derived from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of EEG data - for subsequent DCM of fMRI data. To illustrate this procedure, we generated synthetic EEG and fMRI timeseries for a mismatch negativity (or auditory oddball) paradigm, using biologically plausible model parameters (i.e., posterior expectations from a DCM of empirical, open access, EEG data). Using model inversion, we found that Bayesian fusion provided a substantial improvement in marginal likelihood or model evidence, indicating a more efficient estimation of model parameters, in relation to inverting fMRI data alone. We quantified the benefits of multimodal fusion with the information gain pertaining to neuronal and haemodynamic parameters - as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between their prior and posterior densities. Remarkably, this analysis suggested that EEG data can improve estimates of haemodynamic parameters; thereby furnishing proof-of-principle that Bayesian fusion of EEG and fMRI is necessary to resolve conditional dependencies between neuronal and haemodynamic estimators. These results suggest that Bayesian fusion may offer a useful approach that exploits the complementary temporal (EEG) and spatial (fMRI) precision of different data modalities. We envisage the procedure could be applied to any multimodal dataset that can be explained by a DCM with a common neuronal parameterisation.

Based on our previous findings, we hypothesized that GVS, which excites the vestibular nerve fibers, (a) increases functional connectivity in temporoparietal regions processing vestibular signals, and (b) alleviates abnormal visual-vestibular interaction. Rs-fMRI of 26 patients and 26 age-matched healthy control subjects was compared before and after GVS. The stimulation elicited a motion percept in all participants. Using different analyses (degree centrality, DC; fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations [fALFF] and seed-based functional connectivity, FC), group comparisons revealed smaller rs-fMRI in the right Rolandic operculum of patients. After GVS, rs-fMRI increased in the right Rolandic operculum in both groups and in the patients' cerebellar Crus 1 which was related to vestibular hypofunction. GVS elicited a fALFF increase in the visual cortex of patients that was inversely correlated with the patients' rating of perceived dizziness. After GVS, FC between parietoinsular cortex and higher visual areas increased in healthy controls but not in patients. In conclusion, short-term GVS is able to modulate rs-fMRI in healthy controls and BV patients. GVS elicits an increase of the reduced rs-fMRI in the patients' right Rolandic operculum, which may be an important contribution to restore the disturbed visual-vestibular interaction. The GVS-induced changes in the cerebellum and the visual cortex were associated with lower dizziness-related handicaps in patients, possibly reflecting beneficial neural plasticity that might subserve visual-vestibular compensation of deficient self-motion perception.

Here, we investigate the effects of wearing a surgical mask on fMRI data in n = 37 healthy participants. Activations during finger tapping, emotional face matching, working memory tasks, and rest were examined. Preliminary fMRI analyses show that despite the different mask states, resting-state signals and task activations were relatively similar. Resting-state functional connectivity showed negligible attenuation patterns in mask-on compared with mask-off. Task-based ROI analysis also demonstrated no significant difference between the two mask states under each contrast investigated. Notwithstanding the overall insignificant effects, these results indicate that wearing a face mask during fMRI has little to no significant effect on resting-state and task activations. Wearing a face mask during fMRI has little to no significant effect on resting-state and task activations.

A flow-diffusion model of oxygen transport for quantitative mapping of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) with single gas calibrated fMRI	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Calibrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (calibrated fMRI); cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2); hypercapnia; hyperoxia; oxygen transport modelling	BLOOD-FLOW; EXTRACTION FRACTION; MRI METHODS; BOLD; QUANTIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; HYPERCAPNIA; HEMOGLOBIN; HYPEROXIA; VOLUME	One promising approach for mapping CMRO2 is dual-calibrated functional MRI (dc-fMRI). This method exploits the Fick Principle to combine estimates of CBF from ASL, and OEF derived from BOLD-ASL measurements during arterial O-2 and CO2 modulations. Multiple gas modulations are required to decouple OEF and deoxyhemoglobin-sensitive blood volume. We propose an alternative single gas calibrated fMRI framework, integrating a model of oxygen transport, that links blood volume and CBF to OEF and creates a mapping between the maximum BOLD signal, CBF and OEF (and CMRO2). Simulations demonstrated the method's viability within physiological ranges of mitochondrial oxygen pressure, PmO2, and mean capillary transit time. A dc-fMRI experiment, performed on 20 healthy subjects using O-2 and CO2 challenges, was used to validate the approach. The validation conveyed expected estimates of model parameters (e.g., low PmO2), with spatially uniform OEF maps (grey matter, GM, OEF spatial standard deviation approximate to 0.13). GM OEF estimates obtained with hypercapnia calibrated fMRI correlated with dc-fMRI (r = 0.65, p = 2 center dot 10(-3)). For 12 subjects, OEF measured with dc-fMRI and the single gas calibration method were correlated with whole-brain OEF derived from phase measures in the superior sagittal sinus (r = 0.58, p = 0.048; r = 0.64, p = 0.025 respectively). Simplified calibrated fMRI using hypercapnia holds promise for clinical application.

J	Geerts, H; Roberts, P; Spiros, A				Geerts, Hugo; Roberts, Patrick; Spiros, Athan			Exploring the relation between BOLD fMRI and cognitive performance using a computer-based quantitative systems pharmacology model: Applications to the COMTVAL158MET genotype and ketamine	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Genotype; Schizophrenia; Working memory; Futile activation; Virtual patient trial	COMT GENOTYPE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; SYMPTOMS; POLYMORPHISM; INHIBITION; IMPAIRMENT; METABOLISM; IMPACT; MEMORY	BOLD fMRI is increasingly used mostly in an observational way to probe the effect of genotypes or therapeutic intervention in normal and diseased subjects. We use a mechanism-based quantitative systems pharmacology computer model of a human cortical microcircuit, previously calibrated for the 2-back working memory paradigm, adding established biophysical principles, of glucose metabolism, oxygen consumption, neurovascular effects and the paramagnetic impact on blood oxygen levels to calculate a readout for the voxel-based BOLD fMRI signal. The objective was to study the effect of the Catechol-O-methyl Transferase Val158Met (COMT) genotype on performance and BOLD fMRI. While the simulation suggests that on average virtual COMTVV genotype subjects perform worse, subjects with lower GABA, lower 5-HT3 and higher 5-HT1A activation can improve cognitive performance to the level of COMTMM subjects but at the expense of higher BOLD fMRI signal. In a schizophrenia condition, increased NMDA, GABA tone and noise levels, and lower D1R activity can improve cognitive outcome with greater BOLD fMRI signal in COMT Val-carriers. We further generate hypotheses about why ketamine in healthy controls increases the BOLD fMRI signal but reduces cognitive performance. These simulations suggest a strong non-linear relationship between BOLD fMRI signal and cognitive performance. When validated, this mechanistic approach can be useful for moving beyond the descriptive nature of BOLD fMRI imaging and supporting the proper interpretation of imaging biomarkers in CNS disorders.

From mathematics to medicine: A practical primer on topological data analysis (TDA) and the development of related analytic tools for the functional discovery of latent structure in fMRI data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY; BRAIN NETWORKS; RESTING-STATE; CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; BOLD; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COGNITION; SIGNALS; MODEL	fMRI is the preeminent method for collecting signals from the human brain in vivo, for using these signals in the service of functional discovery, and relating these discoveries to anatomical structure. Numerous computational and mathematical techniques have been deployed to extract information from the fMRI signal. Yet, the application of Topological Data Analyses (TDA) remain limited to certain sub-areas such as connectomics (that is, with summarized versions of fMRI data). While connectomics is a natural and important area of application of TDA, applications of TDA in the service of extracting structure from the (non-summarized) fMRI data itself are heretofore nonexistent. "Structure" within fMRI data is determined by dynamic fluctuations in spatially distributed signals over time, and TDA is well positioned to help researchers better characterize mass dynamics of the signal by rigorously capturing shape within it. To accurately motivate this idea, we a) survey an established method in TDA ("persistent homology") to reveal and describe how complex structures can be extracted from data sets generally, and b) describe how persistent homology can be applied specifically to fMRI data. We provide explanations for some of the mathematical underpinnings of TDA (with expository figures), building ideas in the following sequence: a) fMRI researchers can and should use TDA to extract structure from their data; b) this extraction serves an important role in the endeavor of functional discovery, and c) TDA approaches can complement other established approaches toward fMRI analyses (for which we provide examples). We also provide detailed applications of TDA to fMRI data collected using established paradigms, and offer our software pipeline for readers interested in emulating our methods. This working overview is both an inter-disciplinary synthesis of ideas (to draw researchers in TDA and fMRI toward each other) and a detailed description of methods that can motivate collaborative research.

Here, the authors record ultrafast fMRI signals in anesthetized female rats to demonstrate intrinsic macroscale oscillatory modes which drive correlated activity between distant regions. Spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals correlate across distant brain areas, shaping functionally relevant intrinsic networks. However, the generative mechanism of fMRI signal correlations, and in particular the link with locally-detected ultra-slow oscillations, are not fully understood. To investigate this link, we record ultrafast ultrahigh field fMRI signals (9.4 Tesla, temporal resolution = 38 milliseconds) from female rats across three anesthesia conditions. Power at frequencies extending up to 0.3 Hz is detected consistently across rat brains and is modulated by anesthesia level. Principal component analysis reveals a repertoire of modes, in which transient oscillations organize with fixed phase relationships across distinct cortical and subcortical structures. Oscillatory modes are found to vary between conditions, resonating at faster frequencies under medetomidine sedation and reducing both in number, frequency, and duration with the addition of isoflurane. Peaking in power within clear anatomical boundaries, these oscillatory modes point to an emergent systemic property. This work provides additional insight into the origin of oscillations detected in fMRI and the organizing principles underpinning spontaneous long-range functional connectivity.

Single-value scores of memory-related brain activity reflect dissociable neuropsychological and anatomical signatures of neurocognitive aging	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cognitive aging; episodic memory; fMRI; hippocampus; memory impairment; subsequent memory effect	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DOPAMINERGIC MIDBRAIN; COGNITIVE RESERVE; NOVELTY; ACTIVATION; FMRI; DECLINE; METAANALYSIS; MARKERS	Memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations show age-related differences across multiple brain regions that can be captured in summary statistics like single-value scores. Recently, we described two single-value scores reflecting deviations from prototypical whole-brain fMRI activity of young adults during novelty processing and successful encoding. Here, we investigate the brain-behavior associations of these scores with age-related neurocognitive changes in 153 healthy middle-aged and older adults. All scores were associated with episodic recall performance. The memory network scores, but not the novelty network scores, additionally correlated with medial temporal gray matter and other neuropsychological measures including flexibility. Our results thus suggest that novelty-network-based fMRI scores show high brain-behavior associations with episodic memory and that encoding-network-based fMRI scores additionally capture individual differences in other aging-related functions. More generally, our results suggest that single-value scores of memory-related fMRI provide a comprehensive measure of individual differences in network dysfunction that may contribute to age-related cognitive decline.

In conventional functional MRI (fMRI), brain signaling is detected indirectly, via localized activity-dependent changes in regional blood flow, oxygenation, and volume, to which MRI contrast can be readily sensitized. Although such hemodynamic fMRI methods are powerful tools for analysis of brain activity, they lack specificity for the many molecules and cell types that play functionally distinct roles in neural processing. A suite of techniques collectively known to as "molecular fMRI," addresses this limitation by permitting MRI-based detection of specific molecular processes in deep brain tissue. This review discusses how molecular fMRI is coming to be used in the study of neurochemical dynamics that mediate intercellular communication in the brain. Neurochemical molecular fMRI is a potentially powerful approach for mechanistic analysis of brain-wide function, but the techniques are still in early stages of development. Here we provide an overview of the major advances and results that have been achieved to date, as well as directions for further development.

Validating Linear Systems Analysis for Laminar fMRI: Temporal Additivity for Stimulus Duration Manipulations	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Cortical laminae; fMRI; Visual system; Neuroimaging; Linear systems	OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; SPIN-ECHO; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CORTICAL DEPTH; NEGATIVE BOLD; MYELIN CONTRAST	Advancements in ultra-high field (7 T and higher) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners have made it possible to investigate both the structure and function of the human brain at a sub-millimeter scale. As neuronal feedforward and feedback information arrives in different layers, sub-millimeter functional MRI has the potential to uncover information processing between cortical micro-circuits across cortical depth, i.e. laminar fMRI. For nearly all conventional fMRI analyses, the main assumption is that the relationship between local neuronal activity and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal adheres to the principles of linear systems theory. For laminar fMRI, however, directional blood pooling across cortical depth stemming from the anatomy of the cortical vasculature, potentially violates these linear system assumptions, thereby complicating analysis and interpretation. Here we assess whether the temporal additivity requirement of linear systems theory holds for laminar fMRI. We measured responses elicited by viewing stimuli presented for different durations and evaluated how well the responses to shorter durations predicted those elicited by longer durations. We find that BOLD response predictions are consistently good predictors for observed responses, across all cortical depths, and in all measured visual field maps (V1, V2, and V3). Our results suggest that the temporal additivity assumption for linear systems theory holds for laminar fMRI. We thus show that the temporal additivity assumption holds across cortical depth for sub-millimeter gradient-echo BOLD fMRI in early visual cortex.

This Consensus Statement provides a checklist for reporting concurrent tES-fMRI research. Low-intensity transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), including alternating or direct current stimulation, applies weak electrical stimulation to modulate the activity of brain circuits. Integration of tES with concurrent functional MRI (fMRI) allows for the mapping of neural activity during neuromodulation, supporting causal studies of both brain function and tES effects. Methodological aspects of tES-fMRI studies underpin the results, and reporting them in appropriate detail is required for reproducibility and interpretability. Despite the growing number of published reports, there are no consensus-based checklists for disclosing methodological details of concurrent tES-fMRI studies. The objective of this work was to develop a consensus-based checklist of reporting standards for concurrent tES-fMRI studies to support methodological rigor, transparency and reproducibility (ContES checklist). A two-phase Delphi consensus process was conducted by a steering committee (SC) of 13 members and 49 expert panelists through the International Network of the tES-fMRI Consortium. The process began with a circulation of a preliminary checklist of essential items and additional recommendations, developed by the SC on the basis of a systematic review of 57 concurrent tES-fMRI studies. Contributors were then invited to suggest revisions or additions to the initial checklist. After the revision phase, contributors rated the importance of the 17 essential items and 42 additional recommendations in the final checklist. The state of methodological transparency within the 57 reviewed concurrent tES-fMRI studies was then assessed by using the checklist. Experts refined the checklist through the revision and rating phases, leading to a checklist with three categories of essential items and additional recommendations: (i) technological factors, (ii) safety and noise tests and (iii) methodological factors. The level of reporting of checklist items varied among the 57 concurrent tES-fMRI papers, ranging from 24% to 76%. On average, 53% of checklist items were reported in a given article. In conclusion, use of the ContES checklist is expected to enhance the methodological reporting quality of future concurrent tES-fMRI studies and increase methodological transparency and reproducibility.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging with independent component analysis for presurgical seizure onset zone localization: A systematic review and meta-analysis	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						epilepsy surgery; independent component analysis; noninvasive; rs-fMRI; seizure onset zone	EPILEPSY SURGERY; EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; CONNECTIVITY; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; COMPLICATIONS; ELECTRODES; OUTCOMES; QUALITY	Objective One of the greatest challenges of achieving successful surgical outcomes in patients with epilepsy is the ability to properly localize the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Many techniques exist for localizing the SOZ, including intracranial electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and stereoelectroencephalography. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in conjunction with independent component analysis (ICA) has been utilized for presurgical planning of SOZ resection, with varying results. In this meta-analysis, we analyze the current role of rs-fMRI in identifying the SOZ for presurgical planning for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate its current effectiveness compared to other methods of SOZ localization. Methods A literature review was conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases up to May of 2020. A total of 253 articles were screened, and seven studies were chosen for analysis. Each study was analyzed for SOZ localization by ground truth, SOZ localization by rs-fMRI with ICA, principal component analysis, or intrinsic connectivity contrast, and outcomes of surgery. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze how ground truth compares to rs-fMRI in SOZ localization. Results The odds ratio comparing ground truth to rs-fMRI was 2.63 (95% confidence interval = 0.66-10.56). Average concordance of rs-fMRI SOZ localization compared with ground truth localization across studies was 71.3%. Significance In the hunt for less invasive presurgical planning for epilepsy surgery, rs-fMRI with ICA provides a promising avenue for future standard practice. Our preliminary results show no significant difference in surgical outcomes between traditional standards of SOZ localization and rs-fMRI with ICA. We believe that rs-fMRI could be a step forward in this search. Further investigation comparing rs-fMRI to traditional methods of SOZ localization should be conducted, with the hope of moving toward relying solely on noninvasive screening methods.

Because fMRI measures brain activity indirectly, electroencephalography (EEG) has been recently considered a feasible tool for detecting such networks, particularly the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, a truly unbiased validation of such claims is still missing, which can only be accomplished by using simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data, due to the spontaneous nature of the activity underlying the RSNs. Additionally, EEG is still poorly explored for the purpose of mapping task-specific networks, and no studies so far have been focused on investigating networks' dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) with EEG. Here, we started by validating RSNs derived from the continuous reconstruction of EEG sources by directly comparing them with those derived from simultaneous fMRI data of 10 healthy participants, and obtaining an average overlap (quantified by the Dice coefficient) of 0.4. We also showed the ability of EEG to map the facial expressions processing network (FEPN), highlighting regions near the posterior superior temporal sulcus, where the FEPN is anchored. Then, we measured the dFC using EEG for the first time in this context, estimated dFC brain states using dictionary learning, and compared such states with those obtained from the fMRI. We found a statistically significant match between fMRI and EEG dFC states, and determined the existence of two matched dFC states which contribution over time was associated with the brain activity at the FEPN, showing that the dynamics of FEPN can be captured by both fMRI and EEG. Our results push the limits of EEG toward being used as a brain imaging tool, while supporting the growing literature on EEG correlates of (dynamic) functional connectivity measured with fMRI, and providing novel insights into the coupling mechanisms underlying the two imaging techniques.

The DNN artificial neural network consists of one temporal convolutional layer, one long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, one time-distributed fully-connected layer, and one unconventional selection layer in sequential order. The LSTM layer takes not only the current time point but also what was perceived in a previous time point as its input to characterize the temporal autocorrelation of fMRI data. The fully-connected layer weights the output of the LSTM layer, and the output denoised fMRI time series is selected by the selection layer. Assuming that task-related neural response is limited to gray matter, the model parameters in the DNN network are optimized by maximizing the correlation difference between gray matter voxels and white matter or ventricular cerebrospinal fluid voxels. Instead of targeting a particular noise source, the proposed neural network takes advantage of the task design matrix to better extract task-related signal in fMRI data. The DNN network, along with other traditional denoising techniques, has been applied on simulated data, working memory task fMRI data acquired from a cohort of healthy subjects and episodic memory task fMRI data acquired from a small set of healthy elderly subjects. Qualitative and quantitative measurements were used to evaluate the performance of different denoising techniques. In the simulation, DNN improves fMRI activation detection and also adapts to varying hemodynamic response functions across different brain regions. DNN efficiently reduces physiological noise and generates more homogeneous task-response correlation maps in real data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Use of Functional MRI in Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Diseases: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Parkinson's disease; functional connectivity; DBS; deep brain stimulation; fMRI; functional MRI; neuroimaging	GLOBUS-PALLIDUS INTERNUS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MODULATION; MOTOR; PAIN	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to modulate aberrant circuits associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) for decades and has shown robust therapeutic benefits. However, the mechanism of action of DBS remains incompletely understood. With technological advances, there is an emerging use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after DBS implantation to explore the effects of stimulation on brain networks in PD. This systematic review was designed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to summarize peer-reviewed articles published within the past 10 years in which fMRI was employed on patients with PD-DBS. Search in PubMed database provided 353 references, and screenings resulted in a total of 19 studies for qualitative synthesis regarding study designs (fMRI scan timepoints and paradigm), methodology, and PD subtypes. This review concluded that fMRI may be used in patients with PD-DBS after proper safety test; resting-state and block-based fMRI designs have been employed to explore the effects of DBS on brain networks and the mechanism of action of the DBS, respectively. With further validation of safety use of fMRI and advances in imaging techniques, fMRI may play an increasingly important role in better understanding of the mechanism of stimulation as well as in improving clinical care to provide subject-specific neuromodulation treatments.

J	Sharma, S; Nelissen, K				Sharma, Saloni; Nelissen, Koen			No Evidence for Cross-Modal fMRI Adaptation in Macaque Parieto-Premotor Mirror Neuron Regions	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						macaque; fMRI; adaptation; cross-modal; action; motor	COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; MULTIMODAL ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; BRAIN; ORGANIZATION; SELECTIVITY; RESPONSES; CONVEXITY; MOTOR	To probe the presence of mirror neurons in the human brain, cross-modal fMRI adaptation has been suggested as a suitable technique. The rationale behind this suggestion is that this technique allows making more accurate inferences about neural response properties underlying fMRI voxel activations, beyond merely showing shared voxels that are active during both action observation and execution. However, the validity of using cross-modal fMRI adaptation to demonstrate the presence of mirror neurons in parietal and premotor brain regions has been questioned given the inconsistent and weak results obtained in human studies. A better understanding of cross-modal fMRI adaptation effects in the macaque brain is required as the rationale for using this approach is based on several assumptions related to macaque mirror neuron response properties that still need validation. Here, we conducted a cross-modal fMRI adaptation study in macaque monkeys, using the same action execution and action observation tasks that successfully yielded mirror neuron region cross-modal action decoding in a previous monkey MVPA study. We scanned two male rhesus monkeys while they first executed a sequence of either reach-and-grasp or reach-and-touch hand actions and then observed a video of a human actor performing these motor acts. Both whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses failed to demonstrate cross-modal fMRI adaptation effects in parietal and premotor mirror neuron regions. Our results, in line with previous findings in non-human primates, show that cross-modal motor-to-visual fMRI adaptation is not easily detected in monkey brain regions known to house mirror neurons. Thus, our results advocate caution in using cross-modal fMRI adaptation as a method to infer whether mirror neurons can be found in the primate brain.

In this paper, we employed the recently introduced Correlated Coupled Tensor Matrix Factorization (CCMTF) method for analysis of the emotion regulation paradigm based on EEG frontal asymmetry neurofeedback in the alpha frequency band with simultaneous fMRI. CCMTF method assumes that the co-variations of the common dimension (temporal dimension) between EEG and fMRI are correlated and not necessarily identical. The results of the CCMTF method suggested that EEG and fMRI had similar covariations during the transition of brain activities from resting states to task (view and upregulation) states and these covariations followed an increasing trend. The fMRI shared spatial component showed activations in the limbic system, DLPFC, OFC, and VLPC regions, which were consistent with the previous studies and were linked to EEG frequency patterns in the range of 1-15 Hz with a correlation value close to 0.75. The estimated regions from the CCMTF method were then used as the candidate nodes for dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis, in which the changes in connectivity from view to upregulation states were examined. The results of the dFC analysis were compared with a Normalized Mutual information (NMI) based approach in two different frequency ranges (1-15 and 15-40 Hz) as the NMI method was applied to the vectors of dFC nodes of EEG and fMRI data. The results of the two methods illustrated that the relation between EEG and fMRI datasets was mostly in the frequency range of 1-15 Hz. These relations were both in the brain activations and the dFCs between the two modalities. This paper suggests that the CCMTF method is a capable approach for extracting the shared information between EEG and fMRI data and can reveal new information about brain functions and their connectivity without solving the EEG inverse problem or analyzing different frequency bands.

Proper evaluation of connectivity requires removal of non-neural contributions to the fMRI signal, in particular hemodynamic changes associated with autonomic variability. Regression analysis based on autonomic indicator signals has been used for this purpose, but may be inadequate if neuronal and autonomic activities covary. To investigate this potential co-variation, we performed rsfMRI experiments while concurrently acquiring electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic indicator signals, including heart rate, respiratory depth, and peripheral vascular tone. We identified a recurrent and systematic spatiotemporal pattern of fMRI (named as fMRI cascade), which features brief signal reductions in salience and default-mode networks and the thalamus, followed by a biphasic global change with a sensory-motor dominance. This fMRI cascade, which was mostly observed during eyes-closed condition, was accompanied by large EEG and autonomic changes indicative of arousal modulations. Importantly, the removal of the fMRI cascade dynamics from rsfMRI diminished its correlations with various signals. These results suggest that the rsfMRI correlations with various physiological and neural signals are not independent but arise, at least partly, from the fMRI cascades and associated neural and physiological changes at arousal modulations.

Despite measuring different proxies of brain activity, both the measured blood-oxygenation (fMRI) and neurophysiological recordings (EEG) are indirectly coupled. The electrophysiological and BOLD signal can map the underlying functional connectivity structure at the whole brain scale at different timescales. Previous work demonstrated a moderate but significant correlation between resting-state functional connectivity of both modalities, however there is a wide range of technical setups to measure simultaneous EEG-fMRI and the reliability of those measures between different setups remains unknown. This is true notably with respect to different magnetic field strengths (low and high field) and different spatial sampling of EEG (medium to high-density electrode coverage). Here, we investigated the reproducibility of the bimodal EEG-fMRI functional connectome in the most comprehensive resting-state simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset compiled to date including a total of 72 subjects from four different imaging centers. Data was acquired from 1.5T, 3T and 7T scanners with simultaneously recorded EEG using 64 or 256 electrodes. We demonstrate that the whole-brain monomodal connectivity reproducibly correlates across different datasets and that a moderate crossmodal correlation between EEG and fMRI connectivity of r approximate to 0.3 can be reproducibly extracted in low- and high-field scanners. The crossmodal correlation was strongest in the EEG-beta. frequency band but exists across all frequency bands. Both homotopic and within intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) connections contributed the most to the crossmodal relationship. This study confirms, using a considerably diverse range of recording setups, that simultaneous EEG-fMRI offers a consistent estimate of multimodal functional connectomes in healthy subjects that are dominantly linked through a functional core of ICNs across spanning across the different timescales measured by EEG and fMRI. This opens new avenues for estimating the dynamics of brain function and provides a better understanding of interactions between EEG and fMRI measures. This observed level of reproducibility also defines a baseline for the study of alterations of this coupling in pathological conditions and their role as potential clinical markers.

However, given that mouse functional MRI (fMRI) uses anesthetics for suppression of motion, it has been difficult to directly compare the result of fMRI in "unconsciousness" disease model mice with that in "consciousness" patients. We develop awake fMRI to investigate brain function in 15q dup mice, a copy number variation model of autism. Compared to wild-type mice, we find that 15q dup is associated with whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity and diminished fMRI responses to odors of stranger mice. Ex vivo diffusion MRI reveals widespread anomalies in white matter ultrastructure in 15q dup mice, suggesting a putative anatomical substrate for these functional hypoconnectivity. We show that D-cycloserine (DCS) treatment partially normalizes these anormalies in the frontal cortex of 15q dup mice and rescues some social behaviors. Our results demonstrate the utility of awake rodent fMRI and provide a rationale for further investigation of DCS therapy.

Functional MRI (fMRI) partnered with transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) methods, i.e., transcranial direct current (tDCS), transcranial alternating current (tACS), and transcranial random noise (tRNS) stimulation, explore the neuro-modulatory effects of tES in the targeted brain regions and their interconnected networks and provide opportunities for individualized interventions. Advances in the field of tES-fMRI can be hampered by the methodological variability between studies that confounds comparability/replicability. In order to explore variability in the tES-fMRI methodological parameter space (MPS), we conducted a systematic review of 222 tES-fMRI experiments (181 tDCS, 39 tACS and 2 tRNS) published before February 1, 2019, and suggested a framework to systematically report main elements of MPS across studies. Publications dedicated to tRNS-fMRI were not considered in this systematic review. We have organized main findings in terms of fMRI modulation by tES. tES modulates activation and connectivity beyond the stimulated areas particularly with prefrontal stimulation. There were no two studies with the same MPS to replicate findings. We discuss how to harmonize the MPS to promote replication in future studies.

And deep learning has shown high performance in fMRI data classification and regression, but its requirement for large amounts of data conflicts with the high cost of acquiring fMRI data. MethodsIn this study, we propose an end-to-end temporal contrastive self-supervised learning algorithm, which learns internal spatiotemporal patterns within fMRI and allows the model to transfer learning to datasets of small size. For a given fMRI signal, we segmented it into three sections: the beginning, middle, and end. We then utilized contrastive learning by taking the end-middle (i.e., neighboring) pair as the positive pair, and the beginning-end (i.e., distant) pair as the negative pair. ResultsWe pretrained the model on 5 out of 7 tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and applied it in a downstream classification of the remaining two tasks. The pretrained model converged on data from 12 subjects, while a randomly initialized model required 100 subjects. We then transferred the pretrained model to a dataset containing unpreprocessed whole-brain fMRI from 30 participants, achieving an accuracy of 80.2 & PLUSMN; 4.7%, while the randomly initialized model failed to converge. We further validated the model's performance on the Multiple Domain Task Dataset (MDTB), which contains fMRI data of 26 tasks from 24 participants. Thirteen tasks of fMRI were selected as inputs, and the results showed that the pre-trained model succeeded in classifying 11 of the 13 tasks. When using the 7 brain networks as input, variations of the performance were observed, with the visual network performed as well as whole brain inputs, while the limbic network almost failed in all 13 tasks. DiscussionOur results demonstrated the potential of self-supervised learning for fMRI analysis with small datasets and unpreprocessed data, and for analysis of the correlation between regional fMRI activity and cognitive tasks.

To independently replicate this observation, we performed fMRI experiments in anesthetized mice. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response to whisker stimulation was reliably detected in the primary barrel cortex before and after DIANA experiments; however, no DIANA-like fMRI peak was observed in individual animals' data with the 50 to 300 trials. Extensively averaged data involving 1050 trials in six mice showed a flat baseline and no detectable neuronal activity-like fMRI peak. However, spurious, nonreplicable peaks were found when using a small number of trials, and artifactual peaks were detected when some outlier-like trials were excluded. Further, no detectable DIANA peak was observed in the BOLD-responding thalamus from the selected trials with the neuronal activity-like reference function in the barrel cortex. Thus, we were unable to replicate the previously reported results without data preselection.

During the premanifest stages of HD (pre-HD), there are notable structural and functional brain changes detectable many decades prior to clinical diagnosis. Although caudate atrophy is one of the earliest and most prominent sites of neuropathology, there is also evidence of cortical atrophy, compromised white and grey matter integrity, cortical hypometabolism, and aberrant task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. Pre-HD individuals typically show increased task-related fMRI activity suggested as a strategy to compensate for early brain anomalies. In this study, we used a quantitative model of compensation, known as the CRUNCH (Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis), to explicitly characterise compensation in pre-HD. The assumption of the model is that fMRI activity increases as task difficulty increases (compensatory effect). However, when individuals reach the 'CRUNCH' point, where task difficulty exceeds their neural resources, fMRI activity and performance declines. We acquired fMRI data (n =15 pre-HD; n =15 controls) during performance of an fMRI visuospatial working memory task with low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high memory loads. Consistent with the CRUNCH prediction, pre-HD individuals showed decreased fMRI activity in left intraparietal sulcus at high memory load, compared to healthy controls who showed increased fMRI activity in left intraparietal sulcus at high memory load. Contrary to the other CRUNCH prediction, the pre-HD group did not show compensatory increase in fMRI activity at lower levels of memory loads in left intraparietal sulcus. Our findings provide partial support for the validity of CRUNCH in pre-HD.

Population receptive fields in nonhuman primates from whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiology in visual cortex	ELIFE			English	Article						population receptive field; vision; nonhuman primate; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; Rhesus macaque	VENTRAL EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MONKEY CAUDATE NEURONS; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS; MACAQUE MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; SPATIAL SUMMATION	Population receptive field (pRF) modeling is a popular fMRI method to map the retinotopic organization of the human brain. While fMRI-based pRF maps are qualitatively similar to invasively recorded single-cell receptive fields in animals, it remains unclear what neuronal signal they represent. We addressed this question in awake nonhuman primates comparing whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiological recordings in areas V1 and V4 of the visual cortex. We examined the fits of several pRF models based on the fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, multi-unit spiking activity (MUA), and local field potential (LFP) power in different frequency bands. We found that pRFs derived from BOLD-fMRI were most similar to MUA-pRFs in V1 and V4, while pRFs based on LFP gamma power also gave a good approximation. fMRI-based pRFs thus reliably reflect neuronal receptive field properties in the primate brain. In addition to our results in V1 and V4, the whole-brain fMRI measurements revealed retinotopic tuning in many other cortical and subcortical areas with a consistent increase in pRF size with increasing eccentricity, as well as a retinotopically specific deactivation of default mode network nodes similar to previous observations in humans.

A line through the brain: implementation of human line-scanning at 7T for ultra-high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Line-scanning; high spatiotemporal resolution; fMRI; BOLD; 7T	TRANSIT-TIME HETEROGENEITY; SMALL VESSEL DISEASE; LAMINAR SPECIFICITY; BOLD; MRI; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; COLUMNS; CORTEX; SIGNAL	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used tool in neuroscience to detect neurally evoked responses, e.g. the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Typically, BOLD fMRI has millimeter spatial resolution and temporal resolution of one to few seconds. To study the sub-millimeter structures and activity of the cortical gray matter, the field needs an fMRI method with high spatial and temporal resolution. Line-scanning fMRI achieves very high spatial resolution and high sampling rate, at the cost of a sacrifice in volume coverage. Here, we present a human line-scanning implementation on a 7T MRI system. First, we investigate the quality of the saturation pulses that suppress MR signal outside the line. Second, we established the best coil combination for reconstruction. Finally, we applied the line-scanning method in the occipital lobe during a visual stimulation task, showing BOLD responses along cortical depth, every 250 mu m with a 200 ms repetition time (TR). We found a good correspondence of t-statistics values with 2D gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GE-EPI) BOLD fMRI data with the same temporal resolution and voxel volume (R = 0.6 +/- 0.2). In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of line-scanning in humans and this opens line-scanning fMRI for applications in cognitive and clinical neuroscience.

However, due to the high number of publications, it's nearly impossible to read all the related articles and become aware of the crucial elements or the best approach to invest time and effort in this field. Objectives: Our goal was to gain a better overall understanding of fMRI publications and to use this information in policy and management contexts to make more efficient decisions. Methods: Data were downloaded from Scopus from the 1990s to the end of 2021 based on the theme of fMRI in pediatrics. The retrieved research articles were analyzed with the Bibliometrix package in R software. Results: From 8,544 documents written by 25,697 authors, the USA is by far the most productive country with a total of 3,609 publications. However, regarding the average article citations, Sweden is at the top of the list, with 77.79 average citations. Important themes include emotion, autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, and childhood maltreatment. Conclusions: The results of the present study on fMRI research in the field of pediatrics will be helpful for professionals to visually understand the pediatric modes and trends in fMRI.

Predictive value of functional MRI and EEG in epilepsy diagnosis after a first seizure	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						First fit; New-onset epilepsy; fMRI; Electroencephalography	RESTING-STATE FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORKS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN; ADULTS	It is often difficult to predict seizure recurrence in subjects who have suffered a first-ever epileptic seizure. In this study, the predictive value of physiological signals measured using Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) is assessed. In particular those patients developing epilepsy (i.e. a second unprovoked seizure) that were initially evaluated as having a low risk of seizure recurrence are of interest. In total, 26 epilepsy patients, of which 8 were initially evaluated as having a low risk of seizure recurrence (i.e. converters), and 17 subjects with only a single seizure were included. All subjects underwent routine EEG as well as fMRI measurements. For diagnostic classification, features related to the temporal dynamics were determined for both the processed EEG and fMRI data. Subsequently, a logistic regression classifier was trained on epilepsy and first-seizure subjects. The trained model was tested using the clinically relevant converters group. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (mean +/- SD) of the regression model including metrics from both modalities were 74 +/- 19%, 82 +/- 18%, and 0.75 +/- 0.12, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values (mean SD) of the regression model with both EEG and fMRI features are 84 +/- 14% and 78 +/- 12%. Moreover, this EEG/fMRI model showed significant improvements compared to the clinical diagnosis, whereas the models using metrics from either EEG or fMRI do not reach significance (p > 0.05). Temporal metrics computationally derived from EEG and fMRI time signals may clinically aid and synergistically improve the predictive value in a first-seizure sample. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

RoWDI: rolling window detection of sleep intrusions in the awake brain using fMRI	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						sleep; drowsiness; local sleep; vigilance; mental fatigue; sleep deprivation	RESTING-STATE; CONNECTIVITY; FLUCTUATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; ACTIVATION; CLOSURES	Objective. Brief episodes of sleep can intrude into the awake human brain due to lack of sleep or fatigue-compromising the safety of critical daily tasks (i.e. driving). These intrusions can also introduce artefactual activity within functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, prompting the need for an objective and effective method of removing them. Approach. We have developed a method to track sleep-like events in awake humans via rolling window detection of intrusions (RoWDI) of fMRI signal template. These events can then be used in voxel-wise event-related analysis of fMRI data. To test this approach, we generated a template of fMRI activity associated with transition to sleep via simultaneous fMRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) (N = 10). RoWDI was then used to identify sleep-like events in 20 individuals performing a cognitive task during fMRI after a night of partial sleep deprivation. This approach was further validated in an independent fMRI dataset (N = 56). Main results. Our method (RoWDI) was able to infer frequent sleep-like events during the cognitive task performed after sleep deprivation. The sleep-like events were associated with on average of 20% reduction in pupil size and prolonged response time. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity during the sleep-like events covered thalami-cortical regions, which although spatially distinct, co-existed with, task-related activity. These key findings were validated in the independent dataset. Significance. RoWDI can reliably detect spontaneous sleep-like events in the human brain. Thus, it may also be used as a tool to delineate and account for neural activity associated with wake-sleep transitions in both resting-state and task-related fMRI studies.

Functional connectivity of EEG is subject-specific, associated with phenotype, and different from fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Functional connectivity; Imaginary coherence; Brain-behavior relationships; Reliability	RESTING-STATE FMRI; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BOLD-FMRI; BRAIN; NETWORKS; MEG; ORGANIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS	A variety of psychiatric, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes have been linked to brain ''functional connectivity"- the pattern of correlation observed between different brain regions. Most commonly assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here, we investigate the connectivity-phenotype associations with functional connectivity measured with electroencephalography (EEG), using phase-coupling. We analyzed data from the publicly available Healthy Brain Network Biobank. This database compiles a growing sample of children and adolescents, currently encompassing 1657 individuals. Among a variety of assessment instruments we focus on ten phenotypic and additional demographic measures that capture most of the variance in this sample. The largest effect sizes are found for age and sex for both fMRI and EEG. We replicate previous findings of an association of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the pattern of fMRI func-tional connectivity. We also find an association with socioeconomic status, anxiety and the Child Behavior Checklist Score. For EEG we find a significant connectivity-phenotype relationship with IQ. The actual spatial patterns of functional connectivity are quite different between fMRI and source-space EEG. However, within EEG we observe clusters of functional connectivity that are consistent across frequency bands. Additionally we analyzed reproducibility of functional connectivity. We compare connectivity obtained with different tasks, including resting state, a video and a visual flicker task. For both EEG and fMRI the variation between tasks was smaller than the variability observed between subjects. We also found an increase of reliability with increasing frequency of the EEG, and increased sampling duration. We conclude that, while the patterns of functional connectivity are distinct between fMRI and phase-coupling of EEG, they are nonetheless similar in their robust-ness to the task, and similar in that idiosyncratic patterns of connectivity predict individual phenotypes.

However, DCS is an invasive and time-consuming procedure. fMRI has become a useful tool to delineate motor and sensory eloquent cortex from the areas of planned neurosurgical resection. In our study, we will be studying the reliability of preoperative imaging when compared with the intraoperative DCS. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of fMRI by comparing it with DCS. Methods and Materials: Thirty patients with eloquent cortex lesions were admitted. Preoperative fMRI sequences were loaded into a neuro-navigational system. Intraoperative motor mapping was done by DCS. The location of all cortical stimulated points was correlated with the cortical functional structures. Based on it, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value of fMRI was calculated. Preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky score and MRC grading was then noted. Results: Concordance between fMRI and DCS was noted in 26 cases. Overall mean sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of fMRI as compared to DCS was 95%, 92.48%, 85.56%, and 96.08%, respectively. Preoperative and Postoperative Karnofsky score stayed same in most of the cases [25/30]. Conclusions: DCS remains the gold standard for mapping eloquent cortex in-spite of its invasiveness, side effects such as seizures and cost concerns. Although fMRI cannot replace DCS, it can guide and increase the efficacy in resection, select high-risk patients for intraoperative monitoring, help in preoperative stratification of risk counseling and preservation of neurological status in eloquent brain lesions.

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using conventional echo-planar-imaging (EPI) based sequences can be challenging in brain regions important for olfactory processing, such as the olfactory bulb (OB) and orbitofrontal cortex, mainly due to the signal dropout and distortion artifacts caused by large susceptibility effects from the sinonasal cavity and temporal bone. To date, few studies have demonstrated successful fMRI in the OB in humans. T2-prepared (T2prep) BOLD fMRI is an alternative approach developed especially for performing fMRI in regions affected by large susceptibility artifacts. The purpose of this technical study is to evaluate T2prep BOLD fMRI for olfactory functional experiments in humans. Olfactory fMRI scans were performed on 7T in 14 healthy participants. T2prep BOLD showed greater sensitivity than GRE EPI BOLD in the OB, orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole. Functional activation was detected using T2prep BOLD in the OB and associated olfactory regions. Habituation effects and a bi-phasic pattern of fMRI signal changes during olfactory stimulation were observed in all regions. Both positively and negatively activated regions were observed during olfactory stimulation. These signal characteristics are generally consistent with literature and showed a good intra-subject reproducibility comparable to previous human BOLD fMRI studies. In conclusion, the methodology demonstrated in this study holds promise for future olfactory fMRI studies in the OB and other brain regions that suffer from large susceptibility artifacts.

Brain-based sex differences in schizophrenia: A systematic review of fMRI studies	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Review						functional MRI; neuroimaging; resting-state fMRI; schizophrenia; sex difference; task-based fMRI	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; STEROID-HORMONES; MENTAL ROTATION; MEMORY; CONNECTIVITY; EMOTION; ILLNESS; WOMEN; ASSOCIATIONS; PERFORMANCE	Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with characteristic symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, lack of motivation, and paucity of thought. Recent evidence suggests that the symptoms of schizophrenia, negative symptoms in particular, vary widely between the sexes and that symptom onset is earlier in males. A better understanding of sex-based differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of schizophrenia may provide a key to understanding sex-based symptom differences. This study aimed to summarize sex-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences in brain activity of patients with schizophrenia. We searched PubMed and Scopus to find fMRI studies that assessed sex-based differences in the brain activity of patients with schizophrenia. We excluded studies that did not evaluate brain activity using fMRI, did not evaluate sex differences, and were nonhuman or in vitro studies. We found 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the current systematic review. Compared to females with schizophrenia, males with schizophrenia showed more blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the cerebellum, the temporal gyrus, and the right precuneus cortex. Male patients also had greater occurrence of low-frequency fluctuations in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal lobes and the insular cortex, while female patients had greater occurrence of low-frequency fluctuations in the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and lentiform nucleus. The current study summarizes fMRI studies that evaluated sex-based fMRI brain differences in schizophrenia that may help to shed light on the underlying pathophysiology and further understanding of sex-based differences in the clinical presentation and course of the disorder.

However, due to remarkable inter- and intra-individual variabilities in pain responses, the performance of existing fMRI-based pain prediction models is far from satisfactory. The present study proposed a new approach which can design a prediction model specific to each individual or each experimental trial so that the specific model can achieve more accurate prediction of the intensity of nociceptive pain from single-trial fMRI responses. More precisely, the new approach uses a supervised k-means method on nociceptive-evoked fMRI responses to cluster individuals or trials into a set of subgroups, each of which has similar and consistent fMRI activation patterns. Then, for a new test individual/trial, the proposed approach chooses one subgroup of individuals/trials, which has the closest fMRI patterns to the test individual/trial, as training samples to train an individual-specific or a trialspecific pain prediction model. The new approach was tested on a nociceptive-evoked fMRI dataset and achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than conventional non-specific models, which used all available training samples to train a model. The generalizability of the proposed approach is further validated by training specific models on one dataset and testing these models on an independent new dataset. This proposed individual-specific and trial-specific pain prediction approach has the potential to be used for the development of individualized and precise pain assessment tools in clinical practice.

Relating neural oscillations to laminar fMRI connectivity in visual cortex	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						laminar-fMRI; connectivity; EEG; neural oscillations	ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; TOP-DOWN; EEG; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ACTIVATION; FEEDBACK	Laminar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds the potential to study connectivity at the laminar level in humans. Here we analyze simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and high-resolution fMRI data to investigate how EEG power modulations, induced by a task with an attentional component, relate to changes in fMRI laminar connectivity between and within brain regions in visual cortex. Our results indicate that our task-induced decrease in beta power relates to an increase in deep-to-deep layer coupling between regions and to an increase in deep/middle-to-superficial layer connectivity within brain regions. The attention-related alpha power decrease predominantly relates to reduced connectivity between deep and superficial layers within brain regions, since, unlike beta power, alpha power was found to be positively correlated to connectivity. We observed no strong relation between laminar connectivity and gamma band oscillations. These results indicate that especially beta band, and to a lesser extent, alpha band oscillations relate to laminar-specific fMRI connectivity. The differential effects for alpha and beta bands indicate that they relate to different feedback-related neural processes that are differentially expressed in intra-region laminar fMRI-based connectivity.

Early diagnosis and identification of the stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are crucial in clinical practice. Ideally, biomarkers should reflect the underlying process (pathological or otherwise), be reproducible and non-invasive, and allow repeated measurements over time. However, the currently known biomarkers for AD are not suitable for differentiating the stages and predicting the trajectory of disease progression. Some objective parameters extracted using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are widely applied to diagnose the stages of the AD continuum. While electroencephalography (EEG) has a high temporal resolution, fMRI has a high spatial resolution. Combined EEG and fMRI (EEG-fMRI) can overcome single-modality drawbacks and obtain multi-dimensional information simultaneously, and it can help explore the hemodynamic changes associated with the neural oscillations that occur during information processing. This technique has been used in the cognitive field in recent years. This review focuses on the different techniques available for studying the AD continuum, including EEG and fMRI in single-modality and multi-modality settings, and the possible future directions of AD diagnosis using EEG-fMRI.

The role of functional abnormalities in the discrimination of these disorders can be tested with machine learning (ML) techniques. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of ML studies exploring the potential discriminating role of functional brain alterations identified by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in anxiety disorders. Methods: We conducted a search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus of ML investigations using fMRI as features in patients with anxiety disorders. A total of 12 studies (resting-state fMRI n = 5, task-based fMRI n = 6, resting-state and task-based fMRI n=1) met our inclusion criteria. Results: Overall, the studies showed that, regardless of the classifiers, alterations in functional connectivity and aberrant neural activation involving the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, cerebellum, default mode network, dorsal attention network, sensory network, and affective network were able to discriminate patients with anxiety from controls, with accuracies spanning from 36 % to 94 %. Limitations: The small sample size, different ML approaches and heterogeneity in the selection of regions included in the multivariate pattern analyses limit the conclusions of the present review. Conclusions: ML methods using fMRI as features can distinguish patients with anxiety disorders from healthy controls, indicating that these techniques could be used as a helpful tool for the diagnosis and the development of more targeted treatments for these disorders.

Localizing Spectral Interactions in the Resting State Network Using the Hilbert-Huang Transform	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						resting-state fMRI; ensemble spectral interaction; Hilbert-Huang transform; amplitude-to-amplitude coupling; time-frequency map; wavelet analysis	DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; FMRI; NONSTATIONARY; SPECIFICITY; SIGNALS; CORTEX; NOISE	Brain synchronizations are orchestrated from neuronal oscillations through frequency interactions, such as the alpha rhythm during relaxation. Nevertheless, how the intrinsic interaction forges functional integrity across brain segregations remains elusive, thereby motivating recent studies to localize frequency interactions of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). To this point, we aim to unveil the fMRI-based spectral interactions using the time-frequency (TF) analysis; however, Fourier-based TF analyses impose restrictions on revealing frequency interactions given the limited time points in fMRI signals. Instead of using the Fourier-based wavelet analysis to identify the fMRI frequency of interests, we employed the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for probing the specific frequency contribution to the functional integration, called ensemble spectral interaction (ESI). By simulating data with time-variant frequency changes, we demonstrated the Hilbert TF maps with high spectro-temporal resolution and full accessibility in comparison with the wavelet TF maps. By detecting amplitude-to-amplitude frequency couplings (AAC) across brain regions, we elucidated the ESI disparity between the eye-closed (EC) and eye-open (EO) conditions in rs-fMRI. In the visual network, the strength of the spectral interaction within 0.03-0.04 Hz was amplified in EC compared with that in EO condition, whereas a canonical connectivity analysis did not present differences between conditions. Collectively, leveraging from the instantaneous frequency of HHT, we firstly addressed the ESI technique to map the fMRI-based functional connectivity in a brand-new AAC perspective. The ESI possesses potential in elucidating the functional connectivity at specific frequency bins, thereby providing additional diagnostic merits for future clinical neuroscience.

The lack of effective detection in information mining of rs-fMRI is a main reason for affecting the recognition rate of multi-site diagnostic. This study aims to propose a two-stage adversarial learning model with sliding window that integrates information from multi-site rs-fMRI data at the cost of minimal information loss. First, single rs-fMRI data is sampled with a sliding window to preserve both the spatial and temporal information of original data. And then, site-shared features of these samples are extracted through an adversarial learning model. Finally, the model is fine-tuned to learn discriminative disease-related features. Experimental results show that through adversarial learning, the heterogeneity problem among multi-site data is solved. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal information on rs-fMRI is effectively extracted and yields better classification performance (0.80 accuracy, 0.81 sensitivity, 0.80 specificity) than the state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in the ASD classification task and the importance of fully exploiting the site-shared and spatial-temporal information in rs-fMRI data for multi-site ASD study.

Interictal epileptiform discharge-related EEG-fMRI provides cortical and subcortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes specific to epileptic discharges. As a result, EEG-fMRI has revealed insights into generators and networks involved in epileptic activity in different types of epilepsy, demonstrating-for instance-the implication of the thalamus in human generalized spike and wave discharges and the role of the default mode network in absences and focal epilepsy, and has suggested a mechanism for the cortico-subcortical interactions in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome discharges. EEG-fMRI can find deep sources of epileptic activity not available to scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography, and provides critical new information to delineate the epileptic focus when considering surgical treatment or electrode implantation. In recent years, methodological advances, such as artifact removal and automatic detection of events, have rendered this method easier to implement, and its clinical potential has since been established by evidence of the impact of BOLD response on clinical decision-making and of the relationship between concordance of BOLD responses with extent of resection and surgical outcome. This review presents the recent developments in EEG-fMRI methodology and EEG-fMRI studies in different types of epileptic disorders as follows: EEG-fMRI acquisition, gradient and pulse artifact removal, statistical analysis, clinical applications, presurgical evaluation, altered physiological state in generalized genetic epilepsy, and pediatric EEG-fMRI studies.

While low levels of acceleration are typically part of standard fMRI protocols through parallel imaging, there exists the potential for approaches that allow much greater acceleration. One such existing approach is k-t FASTER, which exploits the inherent low-rank nature of fMRI. In this paper, we present a reformulated version of k-t FASTER which includes additional L2 constraints within a low-rank framework. We evaluated the effect of three different constraints against existing low-rank approaches to fMRI reconstruction: Tikhonov constraints, low-resolution priors, and temporal subspace smoothness. The different approaches are separately tested for robustness to under-sampling and thermal noise levels, in both retrospectively and prospectively-undersampled finger-tapping task fMRI data. Reconstruction quality is evaluated by accurate reconstruction of low-rank subspaces and activation maps. The use of L2 constraints was found to achieve consistently improved results, producing high fidelity reconstructions of statistical parameter maps at higher acceleration factors and lower SNR values than existing methods, but at a cost of longer computation time. In particular, the Tikhonov constraint proved very robust across all tested datasets, and the temporal subspace smoothness constraint provided the best reconstruction scores in the prospectively-undersampled dataset. These results demonstrate that regularized low-rank reconstruction of fMRI data can recover functional information at high acceleration factors without the use of any model-based spatial constraints.

How are representations and operations linked through dynamic interactions? We developed the variational relevance evaluation (VRE) method to analyze individual task fMRI data, which selects informative voxels during model training to localize the "representation", and quantifies the dynamic contributions of single voxels across the whole-brain to different cognitive functions to characterize the "operation". Using 15 individual fMRI data files for higher visual area localizers, we evaluated the characterization of selected voxel positions of VRE and revealed different object-selective regions functioning in similar dynamics. Using another 15 individual fMRI data files for memory retrieval after offline learning, we found similar task-related regions working in different neural dynamics for tasks with diverse familiarities. VRE demonstrates a promising horizon in individual fMRI research. The variational relevance evaluation (VRE) method is developed to analyze individual task fMRI data and characterise task-specific neural interactions.

In a cohort of 49 people with MS and a matched group of 25 healthy subjects (HS), we performed a cognitive evaluation and acquired fMRI. From the fMRI measurement, Pearson correlation-based networks were calculated and graph theoretical parameters reflecting global and local brain organisation were obtained. Additionally, we assessed metrics of scanning quality (signal to noise ratio (SNR)) and fMRI signal quality (temporal SNR and contrast to noise ratio (CNR)). In accordance with the literature, we found that the network parameters were altered in MS compared to HS. However, no significant link was found with cognition. Scanning quality (SNR) did not differ between both cohorts. In contrast, measures of fMRI signal quality were significantly different and explained the observed differences in GTA parameters. Our results suggest that differences in network parameters between MS and HS in fMRI do not reflect a functional reorganisation of the brain, but rather occur due to reduced fMRI signal quality.

Task-related fMRI data processing aims to determine which brain areas are activated when a specific task is performed and is usually based on the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. The background BOLD signal also reflects systematic fluctuations in regional brain activity which are attributed to the existence of resting-state brain networks. We propose a new fMRI data generating model which takes into consideration the existence of common task-related and resting-state components. We first estimate the common task-related temporal component, via two successive stages of generalized canonical correlation analysis and, then, we estimate the common task-related spatial component, leading to a task-related activation map. The experimental tests of our method with synthetic data reveal that we are able to obtain very accurate temporal and spatial estimates even at very low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which is usually the case in fMRI data processing. The tests with real-world fMRI data show significant advantages over standard procedures based on General Linear Models (GLMs).

Probing responses to deep brain stimulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Deep brain stimulation; fMRI; Movement disorders; Functional imaging; Neuromodulation	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; THALAMIC-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS; ACTIVATION; MRI; CIRCUITS; MOTOR	Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for certain movement disorders and has additionally shown promise for various psychiatric, cognitive, and seizure disorders. However, the mechanisms through which stimulation exerts therapeutic effects are incompletely understood. A technique that may help to address this knowledge gap is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This is a non-invasive imaging tool which permits the observation of DBS effects in vivo.Objective: The objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of studies in which fMRI during active DBS was performed, including studied disorders, stimulated brain regions, experimental designs, and the insights gleaned from stimulation-evoked fMRI responses.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published human studies in which fMRI was performed during active stimulation in DBS patients. The search was conducted using PubMED and MEDLINE. Results: The rate of fMRI DBS studies is increasing over time, with 37 studies identified overall. The median number of DBS patients per study was 10 (range = 1-67, interquartile range = 11). Studies examined fMRI responses in various disease cohorts, including Parkinson's disease (24 studies), essential tremor (3 studies), epilepsy (3 studies), obsessive-compulsive disorder (2 studies), pain (2 studies), Tourette syndrome (1 study), major depressive disorder, anorexia, and bipolar disorder (1 study), and dementia with Lewy bodies (1 study). The most commonly stimulated brain region was the subthalamic nucleus (24 studies). Studies showed that DBS modulates large-scale brain networks, and that stimulation-evoked fMRI responses are related to the site of stimulation, stimulation parameters, patient characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes. Finally, a number of studies proposed fMRI-based biomarkers for DBS treatment, highlighting ways in which fMRI could be used to confirm circuit engagement and refine DBS therapy.Conclusion: A review of the literature reflects an exciting and expanding field, showing that the com-bination of DBS and fMRI represents a uniquely powerful tool for simultaneously manipulating and observing neural circuitry.

Motor mapping with fMRI and ECS were retrospectively compared in seven patients with refractory epilepsy in which the primary motor (M1) areas were identified by fMRI and ECS mapping between 2012 and 2019. A right finger tapping task was used for fMRI motor mapping. Blood oxygen level-dependent activation was detected in the left precentral gyrus (PreCG)/postcentral gyrus (PostCG) along the "hand knob" of the central sulcus in all seven patients. Bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMAs) were also activated (n = 6), and the cerebellar hemisphere showed activation on the right side (n = 3) and bilateral side (n = 4). Furthermore, the premotor area (PM) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) were also activated on the left side (n = 1) and bilateral sides (n = 2). The M1 and sensory area (S1) detected by ECS included fMRI-activated PreCG/PostCG areas with broader extent. This study showed that fMRI motor mapping was locationally well correlated to the activation of M1/S1 by ECS, but the spatial extent was not concordant. In addition, the involvement of SMA, PM/PPC, and the cerebellum in simple voluntary movement was also suggested. Combination analysis of fMRI and ECS motor mapping contributes to precise localization of M1/S1.

To date, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides the most comprehensive evaluation of such large-scale circuitry. However, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) has recently emerged as a complementary imaging modality that can extend such measurements towards the context of diverse behavioral states and tasks. Nevertheless, in order to properly interpret the fUSI signal during these complicated scenarios, it must first be carefully validated against well-established technologies, such as fMRI, in highly controlled experimental settings. Here, to address this need, we compared subsequent fMRI and fUSI recordings in response to direct neuronal activation via optogenetics in the same animals under an identical anesthetic protocol. Specifically, we applied various intensities of light stimulation to the primary motor cortex (M1) of mice and compared the spatiotemporal dynamics of the elicited fMRI and fUSI signals. Overall, our general linear model analysis (t-scores) and time series analysis (z-scores) revealed that fUSI was more sensitive than fMRI for detecting optogenetically-induced neuronal activation. Local field potential recordings in the bilateral M1 and striatum also better co-localized with fUSI activation patterns than those of fMRI. Finally, the fUSI response contained distinct arterial and venous components that provide vascular readouts of neuronal activity with vessel-type specificity.

Harnessing the power of endogenous pain control mechanisms for novel therapeutics: how might innovations in neuroimaging help?	CURRENT OPINION IN SUPPORTIVE AND PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Review						descending modulation; fMRI; multimodal imaging; pain; spinal cord	SPINAL-CORD; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BIOMARKER; FAILURE	Purpose of reviewThis review explores the potential of using novel imaging approaches to deepen our understanding of descending modulatory mechanisms in pain, focussing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the spinal cord and novel approaches to combining molecular and fMRI data. This review sheds light on the neural processes involved in pain modulation, paving the way for the development of targeted treatments.Recent findingsThe reviewed literature demonstrates significant advancements in pain research. Recent studies show the potential of using fMRI to investigate the spinal cord's role in pain modulation. Furthermore, novel analytical approaches integrating molecular and fMRI data show promise in elucidating the complex neurobiological processes underlying pain regulation. The main themes explored here include the identification of neurochemical markers associated with pain modulation and the characterisation of neural circuits involved in descending pain control.SummaryA comprehensive understanding of descending modulatory mechanisms in pain can inform the development of novel treatments, targeting dysfunction of these key pathways. By leveraging spinal fMRI and integrating molecular data into brain fMRI, researchers can identify potential therapeutic targets throughout the neuraxis. These advances may contribute to the development of personalised medicine approaches, allowing for tailored interventions based on individual pain profiles.

During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely unexplored. Here we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connlCA) framework to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state datasets (total 40 subjects). Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first component has a uniformly distributed EEG frequency fingerprint linked mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities. Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG. The first hybrid component suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span timescales, from millisecond range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG to second range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI over individuals.

Multiple inversion algorithms are being continuously developed, aiming to tackle the non-uniqueness of this problem, which has been shown to be partially circumvented by including prior information in the inverse models. Despite a few efforts, there are still current and persistent controversies regarding the inversion algorithm of choice and the optimal set of spatial priors to be included in the inversion models. The use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data is one approach to tackle this problem. The spatial resolution of fMRI makes fMRI derived spatial priors very convenient for EEG reconstruction, however, only task activation maps and resting-state networks (RSNs) have been explored so far, overlooking the recent, but already accepted, notion that brain networks exhibit dynamic functional connectivity fluctuations. The lack of a systematic comparison between different source reconstruction algorithms, considering potentially more brain-informative priors such as fMRI, motivates the search for better reconstruction models. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data, here we compared four different inversion algorithms (minimum norm, MN; low resolution electromagnetic tomography, LORETA; empirical Bayes beamformer, EBB; and multiple sparse priors, MSP) under a Bayesian framework (as implemented in SPM), each with three different sets of priors consisting of: (1) those specific to the algorithm; (2) those specific to the algorithm plus fMRI task activation maps and RSNs; and (3) those specific to the algorithm plus fMRI task activation maps and RSNs and network modules of task-related dFC states estimated from the dFC fluctuations. The quality of the reconstructed EEG sources was quantified in terms of model-based metrics, namely the expectation of the posterior probability P(model|data) and variance explained of the inversion models, and the overlap/proportion of brain regions known to be involved in the visual perception tasks that the participants were submitted to, and RSN templates, with/within EEG source components. Model-based metrics suggested that model parsimony is preferred, with the combination MSP and priors specific to this algorithm exhibiting the best performance. However, optimal overlap/proportion values were found using EBB and priors specific to this algorithm and fMRI task activation maps and RSNs or MSP and considering all the priors (algorithm priors, fMRI task activation maps and RSNs and dFC state modules), respectively, indicating that fMRI spatial priors, including dFC state modules, might contain useful information to recover EEG source components reflecting neuronal activity of interest. Our main results show that providing fMRI spatial derived priors that reflect the dynamics of the brain might be useful to map neuronal activity more accurately from EEG-fMRI. Furthermore, this work paves the way towards a more informative selection of the optimal EEG source reconstruction approach, which may be critical in future studies.

The aim was to shed light on the benefits of multiple echoes for various acquisition settings, especially for levels of slice acceleration and flip angle. Whole-brain ME fMRI data were obtained from 26 healthy volunteers (using three echoes; seven runs with slice acceleration 1, 4, 6, and 8; and two different flip angles for each of the first three acceleration factors) and processed as single-echo (SE) data and ME data based on optimal combinations weighted by the contrast-to-noise ratio. Global metrics (temporal signal-to-noise ratio, signal-to-noise separation, number of active voxels, etc.) and local characteristics in regions of interest were used to evaluate SE and ME data. ME results outperformed SE results in all runs; the differences became more apparent for higher acceleration, where a significant decrease in data quality is observed. ME fMRI can improve the observed data quality metrics over SE fMRI for a wide range of accelerated fMRI acquisitions.

Methods: Language mapping with fMRI and functional ECS mapping were retrospectively compared in ten patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent fMRI language mapping and functional ECS mapping between June 2012 and April 2019. A shiritori task, a popular Japanese word chain game, was used for fMRI language mapping. Results: BOLD signal activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (including the pars opecularis and the pars triangularis), and superior temporal gyrus, which is a language-related area, as well as in the left superior and middle frontal gyri, the intraparietal sulcus, and fusiform gyrus. These results were compared with ECS to elucidate the functional role of the activated areas during fMRI language tasks. These activated areas included language areas, negative motor areas, supplementary motor areas (SMAs), and non-functional areas. Conclusion: The activated areas of fMRI language mapping include language-related areas, the negative motor area, and SMAs. These findings suggest the involvement of language and higher order motor networks in verbal expression. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ji, JZ; Zhang, ZZ; Han, L; Liu, JD				Ji, Junzhong; Zhang, Zuozhen; Han, Lu; Liu, Jinduo			MetaCAE: Causal autoencoder with meta-knowledge transfer for brain effective connectivity estimation	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain effective connectivity; Meta-learning; Meta-knowledge transfer; Causal autoencoder; Small-sample fMRI data	GRANGER CAUSALITY; MODEL	Using machine learning methods to estimate brain effective connectivity networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has gradually become one of the hot subjects in the fields of neuroscience. In particular, the encoder-decoder based methods can effectively extract the connections in fMRI time series, which have achieved promising performance. However, these methods generally use Granger causality model, which may identify false directions due to the non -stationary characteristic of fMRI data. Additionally, fMRI datasets have limited sample sizes, which significantly constrains the development of these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel brain effective connectivity estimation method based on causal autoencoder with meta -knowledge transfer, called MetaCAE. The proposed approach employs a causal autoencoder (CAE) to extract causal dependencies from non -stationary fMRI time series, and leverages meta -knowledge transfer to improve the estimation accuracy on small -sample data. More specifically, MetaCAE first employs a temporal convolutional encoder to extract non -stationary temporal information from fMRI time series. Then it uses a structural equation model -based decoder to decode causal relationships between brain regions. Finally, it utilizes a model -agnostic meta -learning method to learn the meta -knowledge of the shared brain effective connectivity among different subjects, and transfers the meta -knowledge to the CAE to enhance its estimation ability on small -sample fMRI data. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real -world data demonstrate the efficacy of MetaCAE in estimating brain effective connectivity.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is instrumental for such in vivo mappings, yet it typically relies on mapping changes in spatial extent of activation or via signal amplitude modulations, whose interpretation can be highly ambiguous. Importantly, a central aspect of neuroplasticity involves modulation of neural activity timing properties. We thus hypothesized that this temporal dimension could serve as a new marker for neuroplasticity. To detect fMRI signals more associated with the underlying neural dynamics, we developed an ultrafast fMRI (ufMRI) approach facilitating high spatiotemporal sensitivity and resolution in distributed neural pathways. When neuroplasticity was induced in the mouse visual pathway via dark rearing, ufMRI indeed mapped temporal modulations in the entire visual pathway. Our findings therefore suggest a new dimension for exploring neuroplasticity in vivo.

These studies indicate that fMRI could have unique characteristics for individuals. In this study, we hypothesized that the dynamic information during 1 min of fMRI was unique and repetitive enough for each subject, so we applied long short-term memory (LSTM) using initial time points of dynamic resting-state fMRI for individual identification. Siamese network is used to obtain robust individual identification performance without additional learning on a new dataset. In particular, by adding a new structure called region of interest-wise average pooling (RAP), individual identification performance could be improved, and key intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) for individual identification were also identified. The average performance of individual identification was 97.88% using the test dataset in eightfold cross-validation analysis. Through the visualization of features learned by Siamese LSTM with RAP, ICNs spanning the parietal region were observed as the key ICNs in identifying individuals. These results suggest the key ICNs in fMRI could represent individual uniqueness.

The origin of burst-suppression and its distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats, the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded-predominantly the primary visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression in unconscious states.

The commonly used brain imaging technologies are fMRI and EEG. Clinical practice has shown that although fMRI is superior to EEG in observing the anatomical details of some diseases that are difficult to diagnose, its costs are prohibitive. In particular, more and more patients who use metal implants cannot use this technology. In contrast, EEG technology is easier to implement. Therefore, to break through the limitations of fMRI technology, we propose a brain imaging modality transfer framework, namely BMT-GAN, based on a generative adversarial network. The framework introduces a new non-adversarial loss to reduce the perception and style difference between input and output images. It also realizes the conversion from EEG modality data to fMRI modality data and provides comprehensive reference information of EEG and fMRI for radiologists. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative comparison with the existing GAN-based brain imaging modality transfer approaches demonstrates the superiority of our framework.

Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates (MSs), which reflect a large topographical representation of coherent electrophysiological brain activity, are widely adopted to study cognitive processes mechanisms and aberrant alterations in brain disorders. MS topographies are quasi-stable lasting between 60-120 ms. Some evidence suggests that MS are the electrophysiological signature of resting-state networks (RSNs). However, the spatial and functional interpretation of MS and their association with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains unclear. Approach. In a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 52), we conducted several statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches analyses on the association among MS spatio-temporal dynamics and the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) simultaneous EEG-fMRI data using statistical and ML approaches. Main results. Our results using a generalized linear model showed that MS transitions were largely and negatively associated with BOLD signals in the somatomotor, visual, dorsal attention, and ventral attention fMRI networks with limited association within the default mode network. Additionally, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) confirmed the association between MS transitioning and fMRI signal while revealing that MS dynamics can model BOLD signals and vice versa. Significance. Results suggest that MS transitions may represent the deactivation of fMRI RSNs and provide evidence that both modalities measure common aspects of undergoing brain neuronal activities. These results may help to better understand the electrophysiological interpretation of MS.

Classic invasive direct electrical stimulation for somatotopic mapping cannot be used to map the whole-body topographical representation of healthy individuals. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an indispensable tool for the noninvasive investigation of somatotopic organization of the human brain using voluntary movement tasks. Unfortunately, body movements during fMRI scanning often cause large head motion artifacts. Consequently, there remains a lack of publicly accessible fMRI datasets for whole-body somatotopic mapping. Here, we present public high-resolution fMRI data to map the somatotopic organization based on motor movements in a large cohort of healthy adults (N = 62). In contrast to previous studies that were mostly designed to distinguish few body representations, most body parts are considered, including toe, ankle, leg, finger, wrist, forearm, upper arm, jaw, lip, tongue, and eyes. Moreover, the fMRI data are denoised by combining spatial independent component analysis with manual identification to clean artifacts from head motion associated with body movements.

In this study, 7 participants were trained to tie seven knots. Their neural representations of these seven procedures were assessed with fMRI as they imagined tying each knot. A subset of the trained participants physically tied each knot in a later fMRI session. Findings demonstrated that procedural knowledge of tying a particular knot can be reliably identified from its fMRI signature, and such procedural signatures were found here in frontal, parietal, motor, and cerebellar regions. In addition, a classifier trained on mental tying signatures was able to reliably identify when participants were planning to tie knots before they physically tied them, which suggests that the mental-tying and physical-tying procedural signatures are similar. These findings indicate that fMRI activation patterns can illuminate the representation and organization of procedural knowledge.

The reason for such seeming paradox is unclear. Here, we enrolled 34 PD patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) for hybrid PET/fMRI scan (PET/fMRI((discovery)) dataset). In addition, 2 replication datasets, namely fMRI((validation-1)) and fMRI((validation-2)) dataset, were also included. We computed ratio of standard uptake value (SUVr) to measure FDG-uptake. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for the following 4 frequency bands was calculated: slow-5, slow-4, slow-3, and slow-2. We obtained a significant group-by-frequency interaction effect of ALFF in the paracentral lobule/supplementary motor area (P-FWE = 0.003) and the right sensorimotor area (P-FWE < 0.001) in the PET/fMRI((discovery)) dataset, which could be replicated using fMRI((validation-1)) and fMRI((validation-2)) datasets (P-FWE < 0.05). In detail, HCs exhibited power law-like fluctuation pattern, but PD patients did not. Correlation analyses further revealed significant associations between ALFF and FDG-uptake in HCs (P-values < 0.031), but not in PD (P-values > 0.28). Taken together, this study identified a fluctuation shift over frequency effect in PD patients, which further disassociated with glucose metabolism in the motor cortex.

However, few studies have used fMRI to explore the mechanisms underlying hand recovery following stroke. Based on the dual visuomotor model positing that two segregated dorsomedial and dorsolateral cerebral networks control reach and grasp movements, we explored the relationship between motor task-related activity in the sensorimotor network and hand recovery following stroke. Behavioral recovery was explored with a handgrip force task assessing simple grasp, and a visuomotor reaching and precise grasping task, the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). We used a passive wrist flexion-extension task to measure fMRI activity in 36 sensorimotor brain areas. Behavioral and fMRI measurements were performed in 27 patients (53.2 +/- 9.5 years) 1-month following stroke, and then 6-month and 24-month later. The effects of sensorimotor activity on hand recovery were analyzed using correlations and linear mixed models (LMMs). PPT and handgrip force correlated with fMRI activity measures in the sensorimotor and parietal areas. PPT recovery was modeled by fMRI measures in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (MI-4p), superior parietal lobule (SPL-7M) and parietal operculum OP1, and lesion side. Handgrip force was modeled by ipsilesional MI-4a, OP1, and contralesional inferior parietal lobule (IPL-PFt). Moreover, the relationship between fMRI activity and hand recovery was time-dependent, occurring in the early recovery period in SPL-BA-7M, and later in MI. These results suggest that areas of both dorsolateral and dorsomedial networks participate to visuomotor reach and grasp tasks (PPT), while dorsolateral network areas may control recovery of simple grasp (handgrip force), suggesting that the type of movement modulates network recruitment. We also found functional dissociations between MI-4p related to PPT that required independent finger movements and MI-4a related to simple grasp without independent finger movements. These findings need to be replicated in further studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An empathy enhancement program for premedical students was developed. The Korean version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Student version (JSE-S) and Interpersonal Reactivity Index (K-IRI) were used to measure self-assessed changes in empathy. Clinical vignettes demonstrating empathy tasks were presented to participants undergoing fMRI, to assess regional changes in the brain. Self-reported empathy scores and brain activity signals using fMRI from before and after the program were compared. The JSE-S total and perspective taking scores significantly increased after the program. Data from the fMRI revealed noticeable differences in cognitive regions associated with empathy, namely the right superior medial frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus. This study results support the prior evidence of positive impact of empathy education. In addition, the authors suggest that brain fMRI might be used in measuring the effectiveness of empathy education.

Higher-order functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data using multivariate cumulants	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						functional connectivity; functional MRI; higher-order connectivity; resting-state	TIME-SERIES; BOOTSTRAP; PATTERNS; STRATEGY; FMRI	Blood-level oxygenation-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most common modality to study functional connectivity in the human brain. Most research to date has focused on connectivity between pairs of brain regions. However, attention has recently turned towards connectivity involving more than two regions, that is, higher-order connectivity. It is not yet clear how higher-order connectivity can best be quantified. The measures that are currently in use cannot distinguish between pairwise (i.e., second-order) and higher-order connectivity. We show that genuine higher-order connectivity can be quantified by using multivariate cumulants. We explore the use of multivariate cumulants for quantifying higher-order connectivity and the performance of block bootstrapping for statistical inference. In particular, we formulate a generative model for fMRI signals exhibiting higher-order connectivity and use it to assess bias, standard errors, and detection probabilities. Application to resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project demonstrates that spontaneous fMRI signals are organized into higher-order networks that are distinct from second-order resting-state networks. Application to a clinical cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis further demonstrates that cumulants can be used to classify disease groups and explain behavioral variability. Hence, we present a novel framework to reliably estimate genuine higher-order connectivity in fMRI data which can be used for constructing hyperedges, and finally, which can readily be applied to fMRI data from populations with neuropsychiatric disease or cognitive neuroscientific experiments. We introduce and assess the performance of higher-order functional connectivity metrics using multivariate cumulants for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These metrics quantify connectivity that cannot be explained by pairwise Pearson correlations. Using a generative model we assess the bias, standard errors and detection probabilities in individual and group level data. Application to resting-state fMRI data demonstrates that spontaneous fMRI signals are organized into higher-order networks that are distinct from the conventional resting-state networks. Furthermore, higher-order connectivity captured relevant non-redundant information in a clinical cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis. image	[Hindriks, Rikkert] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Broeders, Tommy A.

Recent advances in ultra-high field (UHF) fMRI provide a mesoscopic (i.e., submillimeter resolution) tool that allows us to probe laminar and columnar circuits, distinguish bottom-up versus top-down pathways, and map small subcortical areas.We review recent work demonstrating that UHF fMRI provides a robust methodology for imaging the brain across cortical depths and columns that provides insights into the brain's organization and functions at unprecedented spatial resolution, advancing our understanding of the fine-scale computations and interareal communication that support visual cognition.

J	Li, W; Lin, XF; Chen, X				Li, Wei; Lin, Xuefeng; Chen, Xi			Detecting Alzheimer's disease Based on 4D fMRI: An exploration under deep learning framework	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Alzheimer's disease; Convolutional neural network; Long short-term memory network	NETWORK	Applying machine learning methods to various modality medical images and clinical data for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage has many significant results. So far, the image data input to classifier mainly focus on 2D or 3D images. Although some functional imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), generate 4D data which contain both spatial and time-varying information of the brain, for the lack of suitable 4D image processing algorithm, these 4D data were always used by transforming them into functional connectivity or slicing them into 2D/3D pictures which causing apparent information loss. In this paper, we present a 4D deep learning model (C3d-LSTM) for AD discrimination, which is able to utilize the spatial and time-varying information simultaneously by dealing with 4D fMRI data directly. The proposed C3d-LSTM combines a series of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from each volume of 3D static image in fMRI image sequence. Then the feature maps obtained were put into the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the time-varying information contained in the data. Because of the design of structure, C3d-LSTM became an end-to-end data-driven model, which was more convenient for processing 4D fMRI data. The model proposed conducted on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative dataset for algorithm evaluation compared with controlled experiments. Results showed that using 4D fMRI data directly with the proposed method did make a far better result for AD detection than the methods using functional connectivity, 2D, or 3D fMRI data. It demonstrated our assumption that making the most of the natural spatial and temporal information preserved in 4D fMRI data is significant for AD detection and can increase the performance of the classifier. Meanwhile the result implied that the C3d-LSTM model proposed is a suitable model for processing 4D fMRI data and extracting the spatio-temporal property of fMRI data fully for diagnosis of AD.

Increased left inferior fronto-striatal activation during error monitoring after fMRI neurofeedback of right inferior frontal cortex in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						ADHD; fMRI; Neurofeedback; Error monitoring	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN ABNORMALITIES; REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; MEDICATION-NAIVE BOYS; STOP SIGNAL TASK; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; GO/NO-GO; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SELF-REGULATION	Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a self-regulation disorder, with impairments in error monitoring associated with underactivation of the related brain network(s). Psychostimulant medication improves ADHD symptoms and can upregulate brain function, but has side effects, with limbed evidence for longer-term effects. Real-time functional magnetic resonance neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has potential longer-term neuroplastic effects. We previously reported the effects of 11 runs of 8.5 min of fMRI-NF of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) in adolescents with ADHD. This resulted in improvement of clinical symptom and enhanced rIFC activation post-pre treatment during response inhibition, when compared to a control group receiving fMRI-NF of the left parahippocampal gyrus (lPHG). In the current study we applied a novel analysis to the existing data by investigating the effects of fMRI-NF of rIFC in 16 adolescents with ADHD compared to fMRI-NF of lPHG in 11 adolescents with ADHD on the neurofunctional correlates of error monitoring during the same fMRI tracking stop task and potential associations with cognitive and clinical measures. We found stronger performance adjustment to errors in the rIFC-NF compared to the control lPHG-NF group. At the brain function level, fMRI-NF of rIFC compared to that of lPHG was associated with increased activation in error monitoring regions of the left IFC, premotor cortex, insula and putamen. The increased activation in left IFC-insular-striatal error monitoring regions in the rIFC-NF relative to the lPHG-NF group was furthermore trend-wise correlated with NF-induced ADHD symptom improvements. The findings of this study show, that during error monitoring, fMRI-NF training of rIFC upregulation elicited improvement in post-error behavioural adjustments and concomitant increased activation in left hemispheric fronto-insular-striatal and premotor regions mediating self-control and self-monitoring functions. This suggests that the administration of fMRI-NF of the rIFC may have had an impact on wider networks of self-regulation and self-monitoring in adolescents with ADHD.

Combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (EEG-fMRI) can assess the interplay between complementary measures of brain activity and EEG changes to be localized to specific brain regions. We used a two-step approach, where we first examined changes related to a syndrome of mild cognitive impairment irrespective of pathology and then studied the specific impact of amyloid pathology. After detailed clinical and neuropsychological characterization as well as a positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the tracer 11-[C]-Pittsburgh Compound B to estimate cerebral amyloid deposition, 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age 75.6 SD: 8.9) according to standard criteria and 21 cognitively healthy controls (HCS) (mean age 71.8 SD: 4.2) were assessed with EEG-fMRI. Thalamo-cortical alpha-fMRI signal coupling was only observed in HCS. Additional EEG-fMRI signal coupling differences between HCS and MCI were observed in parts of the default mode network, salience network, fronto-parietal network, and thalamus. Individuals with significant cerebral amyloid deposition (amyloid-positive MCI and HCS combined compared to amyloid-negative HCS) displayed abnormal EEG-fMRI signal coupling in visual, fronto-parietal regions but also in the parahippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum. This finding was paralleled by stronger absolute fMRI signal in the parahippocampus and weaker absolute fMRI signal in the inferior frontal gyrus in amyloid-positive subjects. We conclude that the thalamocortical coupling in the alpha band in HCS more closely reflects previous findings observed in younger adults, while in MCI there is a clearly aberrant coupling in several networks dominated by an anticorrelation in the posterior cingulate cortex. While these findings may broadly indicate physiological changes in MCI, amyloid pathology was specifically associated with abnormal fMRI signal responses and disrupted coupling between brain oscillations and fMRI signal responses, which especially involve core regions of memory: the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal cortex.

However, it is debatable whether increased spatial resolutions for haemodynamic-based techniques, like fMRI, can accurately detect the true location of neuronal activity. We have addressed this issue in functional columns and layers of animals with haemoglobin-based optical imaging and different fMRI contrasts, such as blood oxygenation level-dependent, cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume fMRI. In this review, we describe empirical evidence primarily from our own studies on how well these fMRI signals are spatially specific to the neuronally active site and discuss insights into neurovascular coupling at the mesoscale. This article is part of the theme issue 'Key relationships between non-invasive functional neuroimaging and the underlying neuronal activity'.

As an effective treatment for epilepsy, successful surgical resection requires accurate localization of epileptic foci to avoid iatrogenic disability. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technique to localize epileptic foci though clinical applications of rs-fMRI are still at an early stage of development. fMRI data analysis approaches seek pre-defined regressors modeling contributions to the voxel time series, including the BOLD response following neuronal activation. In present study, localization strategies of epileptic foci in rs-fMRI technology were classified and summarized. To begin with, data-driven approaches attempting to determine the intrinsic structure of the data were discussed in detail. Then, as novel fMRI data analysis methods, deconvolution algorithms such as total activation (TA) and blind deconvolution were discussed, which were applied to explore the underlying activity-inducing signal of the BOLD signal. Lastly, effective connectivity approaches such as autocorrelation function method and Pearson correlation coefficient have also been proposed to identify the brain regions driving the generation of seizures within the epileptic network. In the future, fMRI technology can be used as a supplement of intraoperative subdural electrode method or combined with traditional epileptic focus localization technologies, which is one of the most attractive aspect in clinic. It may also play an important role in providing diagnostic information for epilepsy patients.

However, whether abnormalities at the cellular level can be diagnosed from network activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is largely unknown, yet of high clinical relevance. Here a putative mechanism reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, that is, excitation-to-inhibition ratio (E:I), was chemogenetically increased within cortical microcircuits of the mouse brain and measured via fMRI. Increased E:I caused a significant "reduction" of long-range connectivity, irrespective of whether excitatory neurons were facilitated or inhibitory Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were suppressed. Training a classifier on fMRI signals, we were able to accurately classify cortical areas exhibiting increased E:I. This classifier was validated in an independent cohort of Fmr1 (y/-) knockout mice, a model for autism with well-documented loss of parvalbumin neurons and chronic alterations of E:I. Our findings demonstrate a promising novel approach towards inferring microcircuit abnormalities from macroscopic fMRI measurements.

Since noise and artifacts generated by non-neuronal physiological activities are predominant in raw rs-fMRI data, effective noise removal is one of the most important preprocessing steps prior to any subsequent analysis. For rs-fMRI denoising, a common trend is to decompose rs-fMRI data into multiple components and then regress out noise-related components. Therefore, various machine learning techniques have been used in such analyses with predefined procedures and manually engineered features. However, the lack of a universal definition of a noise-related source or artifact complicates manual feature engineering. Manual feature selection can result in the failure to capture unknown types of noise. Furthermore, the possibility that the hand-crafted features will only work for the broader population (e.g., healthy adults) but not for "outliers"(e.g., infants or subjects that belong to a disease cohort) is quite high. In practice, we have limited knowledge of which features should be extracted; thus, multi-classifier assembly must be implemented to improve performance, although this process is quite time-consuming. However, in real rs-fMRI applications, fast and accurate automatic identification of noise-related components on different datasets is critical. To solve this problem, we propose a novel, automatic, and end-to-end deep learning framework dedicated to noise-related component identification via a faster and more effective multi-layer feature extraction strategy that learns deeply embedded spatio-temporal features of the components. In this study, we achieved remarkable performance on various rs-fMRI datasets, including multiple adult rs-fMRI datasets from different rs-fMRI studies and an infant rs-fMRI dataset, which is quite heterogeneous and differs from that of adults. Our proposed framework also dramatically increases the noise detection speed owing to its inherent ability for deep learning ( < 1s for single-component classification). It can be easily integrated into any preprocessing pipeline, even those that do not use standard procedures but depend on alternative toolboxes.

In a meta-analysis, results of different studies on the same topic are combined. To combine the results, it is necessary that all studies provide equivalent pieces of information. However, in task-based fMRI studies we see a large variety in reporting styles. Several specific meta-analysis methods have been developed to deal with the reporting practices occurring in task-based fMRI studies, therefore each requiring a specific type of input. In this manuscript we provide an overview of the meta-analysis methods and the specific input they require. Subsequently we discuss how decisions made during the study influence the eligibility of a study for a meta-analysis and finally we formulate some recommendations about how to report an fMRI study so that it complies with as many meta-analysis methods as possible.

As one of the main funding agencies for basic research in China, the National Natural Scientific Foundation of China (NSFC) has initiated various research programs during the last two decades that are related to fMRI research. In this review, we collected and analyzed the metadata of the projects and published studies in research fields using fMRI that were funded by the NSFC. We observed a trend of increasing funding amounts from the NSFC for fMRI research, typically from the General Program and Key Program.

Graph convolutional network for fMRI analysis based on connectivity neighborhood	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Deep learning; Graph convolutional network; Connectivity-based neighborhood	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; AUTISM; MRI; ORGANIZATION	There have been successful applications of deep learning to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where fMRI data were mostly considered to be structured grids, and spatial features from Euclidean neighbors were usually extracted by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the computer vision field. Recently, CNN has been extended to graph data and demonstrated superior performance. Here, we define graphs based on functional connectivity and present a connectivity-based graph convolutional network (cGCN) architecture for fMRI analysis. Such an approach allows us to extract spatial features from connectomic neighborhoods rather than from Euclidean ones, consistent with the functional organization of the brain. To evaluate the performance of cGCN, we applied it to two scenarios with resting-state fMRI data. One is individual identification of healthy participants and the other is classification of autistic patients from normal controls. Our results indicate that cGCN can effectively capture functional connectivity features in fMRI analysis for relevant applications.

The fMRI signal of the human brain is a nonstationary signal with many noise effects and interference. Based on the commonly used nonstationary signal analysis method, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), we propose an improved circle-EMD algorithm to suppress the end effect. The algorithm can extract different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), decompose the fMRI data to filter out low frequency and other redundant noise signals, and more accurately reflect the true characteristics of the original signal. For the filtered fMRI signal, we use three existing different machine learning methods: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) to achieve effective classification of different task states. The experiment compares the results of these machine learning methods and confirms that the deep neural network has the highest accuracy for task-state fMRI data classification and the effectiveness of the improved circle-EMD algorithm.

Some evidence suggests that spatiotemporally coherent waves are a core feature of spontaneous activity that shapes functional connectivity, although this has been difficult to establish using fMRI given the temporal constraints of the hemodynamic signal. Here, we investigated the structure of spontaneous waves in human fMRI and monkey electrocorticography. In both species, we found clear, repeatable, and directionally constrained activity waves coursed along a spatial axis approximately representing cortical hierarchical organization. These cortical propagations were closely associated with activity changes in distinct subcortical structures, particularly those related to arousal regulation, and modulated across different states of vigilance. The findings demonstrate a neural origin of spatiotemporal fMRI wave propagation at rest and link it to the principal gradient of resting-state fMRI connectivity.

The validity of fMRI paradigms might be undermined by well-known sensory processing abnormalities in SZ that could exert distinct effects on neural activity in the presence of scanner background sound. Given the ubiquity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) paradigms in SZ research, elucidating the relationship between neural, hemodynamic, and sensory processing deficits during scanning is necessary to refine the construct validity of the MR neuroimaging environment. We recorded simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI at rest in people with SZ (n = 57) and healthy control participants without a psychiatric diagnosis (n = 46) and identified gamma EEG activity in the same frequency range as the background sounds emitted from our scanner during a resting-state sequence. In participants with SZ, gamma coupling to the hemodynamic signal was reduced in bilateral auditory regions of the superior temporal gyri. Impaired gamma-hemodynamic coupling was associated with sensory gating deficits and worse symptom severity. Fundamental sensory-neural processing deficits in SZ are present at rest when considering scanner background sound as a "stimulus." This finding may impact the interpretation of rs-fMRI activity in studies of people with SZ. Future neuroimaging research in SZ might consider background sound as a confounding variable, potentially related to fluctuations in neural excitability and arousal.

Manual labeling of the brain usually suffers from intra- and inter-rater variability and is highly time-consuming. Hence, an automatic and efficient skull-stripping method is in high demand for mouse fMRI studies. In this study, we investigated a 3D U-Net based method for automatic brain extraction in mouse fMRI studies. Two U-Net models were separately trained on T2-weighted anatomical images and T2*-weighted functional images. The trained models were tested on both interior and exterior datasets. The 3D U-Net models yielded a higher accuracy in brain extraction from both T2-weighted images (Dice > 0.984, Jaccard index > 0.968 and Hausdorff distance < 7.7) and T2*-weighted images (Dice > 0.964, Jaccard index > 0.931 and Hausdorff distance < 3.3), compared with the two widely used mouse skull-stripping methods (RATS and SHERM). The resting-state fMRI results using automatic segmentation with the 3D U-Net models are highly consistent with those obtained by manual segmentation for both the seed-based and group independent component analysis. These results demonstrate that the 3D U-Net based method can replace manual brain extraction in mouse fMRI analysis.

This can be particularly useful as part of the pre-surgical assessment for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in order to predict cognitive outcome and guide surgical decision-making. Whereas language fMRI is widely used, memory fMRI is less frequently employed in adult TLE, and lacking in childhood TLE. We have developed a combined language/memory fMRI paradigm that is suitable for children, to provide clinically useful information for surgical planning in pediatric TLE. We evaluated this paradigm in 28 healthy children, aged 8 to 18 years. The advantages of this paradigm are: (a) it examines the functional mapping of language and memory networks within one scanning session, (b) provides assessment of both memory encoding- and retrieval-related neural networks, (c) examines recall-based retrieval to engage hippocampal involvement compared to recognition-based retrieval, and (d) provides overt verbal responses to monitor in-scanner memory performance. This novel fMRI paradigm was designed for language and memory mapping in pediatric TLE and could provide clinically useful information for surgical planning. Finally, parallel versions of the paradigm allow the comparison of brain activations pre- and post-surgical intervention.

Here we characterized the impact of the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact on resting-state EEG spectral properties and compared the effectiveness of seven common BCG correction methods to preserve EEG spectral features. We also assessed if these methods retained posterior alpha power reactivity to an eyes closure-opening (EC-EO) task and compared the results from EEG-informed fMRI analysis using different BCG correction approaches. MethodElectroencephalographic data from 20 healthy young adults were recorded outside the MR environment and during simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The gradient artifact was effectively removed from EEG-fMRI acquisitions using Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS). The BCG artifact was corrected with seven methods: AAS, Optimal Basis Set (OBS), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), OBS followed by ICA, AAS followed by ICA, PROJIC-AAS and PROJIC-OBS. EEG signal preservation was assessed by comparing the spectral power of traditional frequency bands from the corrected rs-EEG-fMRI data with the data recorded outside the scanner. We then assessed the preservation of posterior alpha functional reactivity by computing the ratio between the EC and EO conditions during the EC-EO task. EEG-informed fMRI analysis of the EC-EO task was performed using alpha power-derived BOLD signal predictors obtained from the EEG signals corrected with different methods. ResultsThe BCG artifact caused significant distortions (increased absolute power, altered relative power) across all frequency bands. Artifact residuals/signal losses were present after applying all correction methods. The EEG reactivity to the EC-EO task was better preserved with ICA-based correction approaches, particularly when using ICA feature extraction to isolate alpha power fluctuations, which allowed to accurately predict hemodynamic signal fluctuations during the EEG-informed fMRI analysis. DiscussionCurrent software solutions for the BCG artifact problem offer limited efficiency to preserve the EEG spectral power properties using this particular EEG setup. The state-of-the-art approaches tested here can be further refined and should be combined with hardware implementations to better preserve EEG signal properties during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Existing and novel BCG artifact correction methods should be validated by evaluating signal preservation of both ERPs and spontaneous EEG spectral power.

The key is the brain repre-sentation, including functional brain networks (FBN) and their corresponding temporal features. Recently, it has been proven that deep learning models have superb representation power on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) over traditional machine learning methods. However, due to the lack of high -quality data and labels, deep learning models tend to suffer from overfitting in the training process. Methods: In this work, we applied a recurrent Wasserstein generative adversarial net (RWGAN) to learn brain representation from volumetric fMRI data. Generative adversarial net (GAN) is widely used in nat-ural image generation and is able to capture the distribution of the input data, which enables the ex-traction of generalized features from fMRI and thus relieves the overfitting issue. The recurrent layers in RWGAN are designed to better model the local temporal features of the fMRI time series. The dis-criminator of RWGAN works as a deep feature extractor. With LASSO regression, the RWGAN model can decompose the fMRI data into temporal features and spatial features (FBNs). Furthermore, the generator of RWGAN can generate high-quality new data for fMRI augmentation. Results: The experimental results on seven tasks from the HCP dataset showed that the RWGAN can learn meaningful and interpretable temporal features and FBNs, compared to HCP task designs and general linear model (GLM) derived networks. Besides, the results on different training datasets showed that the RWGAN performed better on small datasets than other deep learning models. Moreover, we used the generator of RWGAN to yield fake subjects. The result showed that the fake data can also be used to learn meaningful representation compared to those learned from real data. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, this work is among the earliest attempts of applying generative deep learning for modeling fMRI data. The proposed RWGAN offers a novel methodology for learning brain representation from fMRI, and it can generate high-quality fake data for the potential use of fMRI data augmentation.

However, the inherently poor signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the fMRI measurement represents a major barrier to expanding its spatiotemporal scale as well as its utility and ultimate impact. Here we introduce a denoising technique that selectively suppresses the thermal noise contribution to the fMRI experiment. Using 7-Tesla, high-resolution human brain data, we demonstrate improvements in key metrics of functional mapping (temporal-SNR, the detection and reproducibility of stimulus-induced signal changes, and accuracy of functional maps) while leaving the amplitude of the stimulus-induced signal changes, spatial precision, and functional point-spread-function unaltered. We demonstrate that the method enables the acquisition of ultrahigh resolution (0.5mm isotropic) functional maps but is also equally beneficial for a large variety of fMRI applications, including supra-millimeter resolution 3- and 7-Tesla data obtained over different cortical regions with different stimulation/task paradigms and acquisition strategies.

Efforts to characterize the LC's function in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging have been hampered by its small size and location near a large source of noise, the fourth ventricle. We tested whether the ability to characterize LC function is improved by employing neuromelanin-T1 weighted images (nmT1) for LC localization and multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (ME-fMRI) for estimating intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). Analyses indicated that, relative to a probabilistic atlas, utilizing nmT1 images to individually localize the LC increases the specificity of seed time series and clusters in the iFC maps. When combined with independent components analysis (ME-ICA), ME-fMRI data provided significant improvements in the temporal signal to noise ratio and DVARS relative to denoised single echo data (1E-fMRI). The effects of acquiring nmT1 images and ME-fMRI data did not appear to only reflect increases in power: iFC maps for each approach overlapped only moderately. This is consistent with findings that ME-fMRI offers substantial advantages over 1E-fMRI acquisition and denoising. It also suggests that individually identifying LC with nmT1 scans is likely to reduce the influence of other nearby brainstem regions on estimates of LC function.

Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) is a non-invasive procedure allowing the self-regulation of brain functions via enhanced self-control of fMRI based neural activation. In semantic rt-fMRI-NF, an estimated relation between multivariate fMRI activation patterns and abstract mental states is exploited for a multi-dimensional feedback stimulus via real-time representational similarity analysis (rt-RSA). Here, we assessed the performances of this framework in a multi-subject multi-session study on a 3 T MRI clinical scanner. Approach. Eighteen healthy volunteers underwent two semantic rt-fMRI-NF sessions on two different days. In each session, participants were first requested to engage in specific mental states while local fMRI patterns of brain activity were recorded during stimulated mental imagery of concrete objects (pattern generation). The obtained neural representations were to be replicated and modulated by the participants in subsequent runs of the same session under the guidance of a rt-RSA generated visual feedback (pattern modulation). Performance indicators were derived from the rt-RSA output to assess individual abilities in replicating (and maintaining over time) a target pattern. Simulations were carried out to assess the impact of the geometric distortions implied by the low-dimensional representation of patterns' dissimilarities in the visual feedback. Main results. Sixteen subjects successfully completed both semantic rt-fMRI-NF sessions. Considering some performance indicators, a significant improvement between the first and the second runs, and within run increasing modulation performances were observed, whereas no improvements were found between sessions. Simulations confirmed that in a small percentage of cases visual feedback could be affected by metric distortions due to dimensionality reduction implicit to the rt-RSA approach. Significance. Our results proved the feasibility of the semantic rt-fMRI-NF at 3 T, showing that subjects can successfully modulate and maintain a target mental state when guided by rt-RSA derived feedback. Further development is needed to encourage future clinical applications.

We discuss how the combination of MR hardware, advanced acquisition techniques and various MR contrast mechanisms have enabled recent progress in functional neuroimaging. However, these advanced fMRI practices have only been applied to a handful of neuroscience questions to date, with the majority of the neuroscience community still using conventional imaging techniques. We thus discuss upcoming challenges and possibilities for fMRI technology development in human neuroscience.

To account for these changes in fMRI activation signal, we used breath-hold tasks to mimic hemodynamic changes in brain tumor subjects and scaled the activation response. Methods:Motor and/or language fMRI was performed in 21 subjects with brain tumor. A breath-hold task was also performed in these subjects to obtain the hemodynamic response changes independent of neural changes. The task activation signals were calibrated on a voxel wise basis for all the subjects. Direct cortical stimulation was used to verify the scaled results of task-based fMRI. Results:After scaling for the hemodynamic response function (HRF) on a voxel wise basis, the spatial extent of the scaled activation was more clustered together and appeared to minimize false positives. Similarly, accounting for the underlying canonical HRF, the percentage increase of active voxels after scaling had lower standard non-deviation suggesting that the activation response across voxels were more similar. Conclusion:Although preliminary in nature, this study suggests that the variation in hemodynamic changes can be calibrated using breath-hold in brain tumor subjects and can also be used for other clinical cases where the underlying HRF has been altered.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in design studies: Methodological considerations, challenges, and recommendations	DESIGN STUDIES			English	Article						design cognition; design studies; research methods; psychology of design; functional magnetic resonance imaging	MRI	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables identification of the brain regions and networks underpinning cognitive tasks. It has the potential to significantly advance cognitive design science, but is challenging to apply in design studies and methodological guidance for design researchers is lacking. In this Research Note, we reflect on our experiences and other work to outline the activities involved in developing and executing fMRI design studies. The implications for research quality at each stage are highlighted. We then consider the challenges for fMRI research on design and make recommendations for addressing them. Four critical areas are identified: establishing experimental protocols; establishing a cognitive design ontology; generating foundational knowledge about brain activation; and balancing fMRI constraints against ecological validity.

In this study, we aimed at identifying functional asymmetry effects in fMRI and exploring its potential as a target for fMRI NFB studies by re-analyzing an existing data set containing a resting state measurement and a sad mood induction task of n = 30 participants with remitted major depressive disorder and n = 30 matched healthy controls. We applied low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF, and regional homogeneity and estimated functional asymmetry in both a voxel-wise and regional manner. We assessed functional asymmetry during rest and negative mood induction as well as functional asymmetry changes between the phases, and associated the induced mood change with the change in functional asymmetry. Analyses were conducted within as well as between groups. Despite extensive analyses, we identified only very limited effects. While some tests showed nominal significance, our results did not contain any clear identifiable patterns of effects that would be expected if a true underlying effect would be present. In conclusion, we do not find evidence for FA effects related to negative mood in fMRI, which questions the usefulness of FA measures for real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a treatment approach for affective disorders.

These capabilities have been realized with the recent technical advances of optogenetics and its combination with fMRI, here termed "opto-fMRI." Opto-fMRI allows for targeted brain region-, cell-type-, or projection-specific manipulation and targeted Ca2 + activity measurement to be linked with global brain signaling and behavior. We cover the history, technical advances, applications, and important considerations of opto-fMRI in anesthetized and awake rodents and the future directions of the combined techniques in neuroscience and neuroimaging.

Machine-learning approaches have been widely used in neuroimaging studies; however, few studies have investigated the single-voxel modeling of fMRI data under cognitive tasks. We proposed a hybrid one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) based on the temporal dynamics of single-voxel fMRI time-series and successfully differentiated two continuous task states, namely, self-initiated (SI) and visually guided (VG) motor tasks. First, 25 activation peaks were identified from the contrast maps of SI and VG tasks in a blocked design. Then, the fMRI time-series of each peak voxel was transformed into a temporal-frequency domain by using continuous wavelet transform across a broader frequency range (0.003-0.313 Hz, with a step of 0.01 Hz). The transformed time-series was inputted into a 1D-CNN model for the binary classification of SI and VG continuous tasks. Compared with the univariate analysis, e.g., amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) at each frequency band, including, wavelet-ALFF, the 1D-CNN model highly outperformed wavelet-ALFF, with more efficient decoding models [46% of 800 models showing area under the curve (AUC) > 0.61] and higher decoding accuracies (94% of the efficient models), especially on the high-frequency bands (>0.1 Hz). Moreover, our results also demonstrated the advantages of wavelet decompositions over the original fMRI series by showing higher decoding performance on all peak voxels. Overall, this study suggests a great potential of single-voxel analysis using 1D-CNN and wavelet transformation of fMRI series with continuous, naturalistic, steady-state task design or resting-state design. It opens new avenues to precise localization of abnormal brain activity and fMRI-guided precision brain stimulation therapy.

Multimodal fusion of multiple rest fMRI networks and MRI gray matter via parallel multilink joint ICA reveals highly significant function/structure coupling in Alzheimer's disease	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						AD; multimodal fusion; multiple fMRI networks; overlapping fMRI; parahippocampus; parallel multilink jICA; posterior cingulate; thalamus	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; WHOLE-BRAIN; STATE FMRI; ALGORITHM; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISCONNECTION	In this article, we focus on estimating the joint relationship between structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) gray matter (GM), and multiple functional MRI (fMRI) intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). To achieve this, we propose a multilink joint independent component analysis (ml-jICA) method using the same core algorithm as jICA. To relax the jICA assumption, we propose another extension called parallel multilink jICA (pml-jICA) that allows for a more balanced weight distribution over ml-jICA/jICA. We assume a shared mixing matrix for both the sMRI and fMRI modalities, while allowing for different mixing matrices linking the sMRI data to the different ICNs. We introduce the model and then apply this approach to study the differences in resting fMRI and sMRI data from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus controls. The results of the pml-jICA yield significant differences with large effect sizes that include regions in overlapping portions of default mode network, and also hippocampus and thalamus. Importantly, we identify two joint components with partially overlapping regions which show opposite effects for AD versus controls, but were able to be separated due to being linked to distinct functional and structural patterns. This highlights the unique strength of our approach and multimodal fusion approaches generally in revealing potentially biomarkers of brain disorders that would likely be missed by a unimodal approach. These results represent the first work linking multiple fMRI ICNs to GM components within a multimodal data fusion model and challenges the typical view that brain structure is more sensitive to AD than fMRI.

However, at 3T, the majority of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI experiments are performed using T*(2) -weighted GE sequences because of their superior sensitivity compared to SE-fMRI. The presented SE implementation of a highly accelerated GE pulse sequence therefore aims to improve the sensitivity of SE-fMRI while profiting from a reduction of susceptibility-induced signal dropout. Methods: Spin-echo MR encephalography (SE-MREG) is compared with the more conventionally used spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) and spin-echo simultaneous multislice (SE-SMS) at 3T in terms of capability to detect neuronal activations and resting-state functional connectivity. For activation analysis, healthy subjects underwent consecutive SE-MREG (pulse repetition time [TR] = 0.25 seconds), SE-SMS (TR = 1.3 seconds), and SE-EPI (TR = 4.4 seconds) scans in pseudorandomized order applied to a visual block design paradigm for generation of t-statistics maps. For the investigation of functional connectivity, additional resting-state data were acquired for 5 minutes and a seed-based correlation analysis using Stanford's FIND (Functional Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders) atlas was performed. Results: The increased sampling rate of SE-MREG relative to SE-SMS and SE-EPI improves the sensitivity to detect BOLD activation by 33% and 54%, respectively, and increases the capability to extract resting-state networks. Compared with a brain region that is not affected by magnetic field inhomogeneities, SE-MREG shows 2.5 times higher relative signal strength than GE-MREG in mesial temporal structures. Conclusion: SE-MREG offers a viable possibility for whole-brain fMRI with consideration of brain regions that are affected by strong susceptibility-induced magnetic field gradients.

Moderated<i> t-</i> tests for group-level fMRI analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Moderated t-test; fMRI; Group analysis; LIMMA; LIMMI	SHRINKAGE; RELIABILITY; FAILURE	In recent years, there has been significant criticism of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with small sample sizes. The argument is that such studies have low statistical power, as well as reduced likelihood for statistically significant results to be true effects. The prevalence of these studies has led to a situation where a large number of published results are not replicable and likely false. Despite this growing body of evidence, small sample fMRI studies continue to be regularly performed; likely due to the high cost of scanning. In this report we investigate the use of a moderated t-statistic for performing group-level fMRI analysis to help alleviate problems related to small sample sizes. The proposed approach, implemented in the popular R-package LIMMA (linear models for microarray data), has found wide usage in the genomics literature for dealing with similar issues. Utilizing task-based fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we compare the performance of the moderated t-statistic with the standard t-statistic, as well as the pseudo t-statistic commonly used in non parametric fMRI analysis. We find that the moderated t-test significantly outperforms both alternative approaches for studies with sample sizes less than 40 subjects. Further, we find that the results were consistent both when using voxel-based and cluster-based thresholding. We also introduce an R-package, LIMMI (linear models for medical images), that provides a quick and convenient way to apply the method to fMRI data.

So far, numerous methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of Schizophrenia (SZ) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), among which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) modalities are known as a popular method among physicians. This paper presents an SZ and ADHD intelligent detection method of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) modality using a new deep learning method. The University of California Los Angeles dataset, which contains the rs-fMRI modalities of SZ and ADHD patients, has been used for experiments. The FMRIB software library toolbox first performed preprocessing on rs-fMRI data. Then, a convolutional Autoencoder model with the proposed number of layers is used to extract features from rs-fMRI data. In the classification step, a new fuzzy method called interval type-2 fuzzy regression (IT2FR) is introduced and then optimized by genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and gray wolf optimization (GWO) techniques. Also, the results of IT2FR methods are compared with multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system methods. The experiment results show that the IT2FR method with the GWO optimization algorithm has achieved satisfactory results compared to other classifier methods. Finally, the proposed classification technique was able to provide 72.71% accuracy.

The losses of BOLD sensitivity because of different types of technical and physiological noise remain major sources of fMRI artifacts. Due to difficulty of subjective visual perception of image distortions during data acquisitions, a comprehensive automatic rtQA is needed. To facilitate rapid rtQA of fMRI data, we applied real-time and recursive quality assessment methods to whole-brain fMRI volumes, as well as time-series of target brain areas and resting-state networks. We estimated recursive temporal signal-to-noise ratio (rtSNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (rtCNR), and real-time head motion parameters by a framewise rigid-body transformation (translations and rotations) using the conventional current to template volume registration. In addition, we derived real-time framewise (FD) and micro (MD) displacements based on head motion parameters and evaluated the temporal derivative of root mean squared variance over voxels (DVARS). For monitoring time-series of target regions and networks, we estimated the number of spikes and amount of filtered noise by means of a modified Kalman filter. Finally, we applied the incremental general linear modeling (GLM) to evaluate real-time contributions of nuisance regressors (linear trend and head motion). Proposed rtQA was demonstrated in real-time fMRI neurofeedback runs without and with excessive head motion and real-time simulations of neurofeedback and resting-state fMRI data. The rtQA was implemented as an extension of the open-source OpenNFT software written in Python, MATLAB and C++ for neurofeedback, task-based, and resting-state paradigms. We also developed a general Python library to unify real-time fMRI data processing and neurofeedback applications. Flexible estimation and visualization of rtQA facilitates efficient rtQA of fMRI data and helps the robustness of fMRI acquisitions by means of substantiating decisions about the necessity of the interruption and re-start of the experiment and increasing the confidence in neural estimates.

Critical factors in achieving fine-scale functional MRI: Removing sources of inadvertent spatial smoothing	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cortical surface-based analysis; fMRI preprocessing; high-resolution fMRI; spatial blur; spatial specificity; ultra-high field MRI; V2 stripes	CORTICAL SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; 7 T; ANALYSIS STRATEGIES; FMRI; RESOLUTION; V2; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; COLOR	Ultra-high Field (>= 7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-fMRI) provides opportunities to resolve fine-scale features of functional architecture such as cerebral cortical columns and layers, in vivo. While the nominal resolution of modern fMRI acquisitions may appear to be sufficient to resolve these features, several common data preprocessing steps can introduce unwanted spatial blurring, especially those that require interpolation of the data. These resolution losses can impede the detection of the fine-scale features of interest. To examine quantitatively and systematically the sources of spatial resolution losses occurring during preprocessing, we used synthetic fMRI data and real fMRI data from the human visual cortex-the spatially interdigitated human V2 "thin" and "thick" stripes. The pattern of these cortical columns lies along the cortical surface and thus can be best appreciated using surface-based fMRI analysis. We used this as a testbed for evaluating strategies that can reduce spatial blurring of fMRI data. Our results show that resolution losses can be mitigated at multiple points in preprocessing pathway. We show that unwanted blur is introduced at each step of volume transformation and surface projection, and can be ameliorated by replacing multi-step transformations with equivalent single-step transformations. Surprisingly, the simple approaches of volume upsampling and of cortical mesh refinement also helped to reduce resolution losses caused by interpolation. Volume upsampling also serves to improve motion estimation accuracy, which helps to reduce blur. Moreover, we demonstrate that the level of spatial blurring is nonuniform over the brain-knowledge which is critical for interpreting data in high-resolution fMRI studies. Importantly, our study provides recommendations for reducing unwanted blurring during preprocessing as well as methods that enable quantitative comparisons between preprocessing strategies. These findings highlight several underappreciated sources of a spatial blur. Individually, the factors that contribute to spatial blur may appear to be minor, but in combination, the cumulative effects can hinder the interpretation of fine-scale fMRI and the detectability of these fine-scale features of functional architecture.

One important application is to classify the levels of pain perception from patients' fMRI for clinical pain assessment. However, the huge number of fMRI features and the complex relationships between fMRI and pain levels affect the performance of pain classification models heavily. In this article, we introduce a new fuzzy-rule-based hybrid optimization approach for dimension reduction and multiclassification problems using chaotic map, crow search optimization (CSO), and self-organizing fuzzy logic prototype (SOFLP). The approach is named as CCSO-SOFLP. In the proposed approach, chaotic map-based CSO is employed to find the optimal features from ultra-high-dimensional fMRI, and the fuzzy-rule-based SOFLP is employed for multiclassification of pain levels. In this sense, CSO is provided to avoid being stuck in local minima and to increase the computational performance. On the other hand, multilayer SOFLP classifier can continuously learn from new data and identify prototypes from the observed data and use them to build fuzzy rules, to define a suitable local area for each prototype, and to avoid overlapping. The proposed approach is applied on a pain-evoked fMRI data set to classify the levels of pain. Results indicate that the proposed approach can decode levels of pain and identify predictive fMRI patterns with higher accuracy and convergence speed and shorter execution time. Therefore, the new type of fuzzy-rule-based system with chaotic swarm intelligence holds great potential to predict pain perception in clinical uses.

Methods: A structured literature search was performed and studies with electrode-level data comparing fMRI and ESM for language localization were analyzed. Outcome measures included pooled estimates of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, and specificity. Sources of heterogeneity were explored with a meta-regression framework. Results: Nine studies were included in the analysis having 5-40 patients with mean age 11.3-43.4 years. Verb generation and picture naming were the most common fMRI tasks, while picture naming was the most common ESM task. Sensitivity (0.37-0.95), specificity (0.36-0.97), and DOR (1.9-44.6) for fMRI compared to ESM varied widely across studies with statistically significant heterogeneities. Pooled estimates were: sensitivity 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.54, 0.83), specificity 0.74 (0.58, 0.85), and DOR 7.0 (3.5, 13.8), from a valid meta-analysis (area under the summary receiver-operating-curve 0.78). fMRI was noted to have higher sensitivity in studies using higher maximal ESM currents. fMRI variables could not be included in the meta-regression because of substantial methodological differences among studies. Conclusions: fMRI is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for language localization compared to ESM in well-designed studies. However, because the confidence limits for sensitivity and DOR are close to the line of no effect, and there is high unmeasured heterogeneity, fMRI cannot perhaps be used as the only modality for language localization to inform neurosurgical decisions at present.

But only when stimulation and recordings are combined, the direct impact of the stimulation on neural activity can be evaluated. In humans, this can be achieved non-invasively through the concurrent combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Concurrent TMS-fMRI allows the assessment of the neurovascular responses evoked by TMS with excellent spatial resolution and full-brain coverage. This enables the functional mapping of both local and remote network effects of TMS in cortical as well as deep subcortical structures, offering unique opportunities for basic research and clinical applications. The purpose of this review is to introduce the reader to this powerful tool. We will introduce the technical challenges and state-of-the art solutions and provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and the available experimental approaches. We will highlight the unique insights that can be gained from concurrent TMS-fMRI, including the state-dependent assessment of neural responsiveness and inter-regional effective connectivity, the demonstration of functional target engagement, and the systematic evaluation of stimulation parameters. We will also discuss how concurrent TMS-fMRI during a behavioral task can help to link behavioral TMS effects to changes in neural network activity and to identify peripheral co-stimulation confounds. Finally, we will review the use of concurrent TMS-fMRI for developing TMS treatments of psychiatric and neurological disorders and suggest future improvements for further advancing the application of concurrent TMS-fMRI.

Multivariate analysis methods, such as Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (gCCA), have been increasingly employed in fMRI data analysis, due to their ability to overcome this limitation. This study, evaluates the improvement of sensitivity of the GLM, by applying gCCA to fMRI data after standard preprocessing steps. Data from a block-design fMRI experiment was used, where 25 healthy volunteers completed two action observation tasks at 1.5T. Whole brain analysis results indicated that the application of gCCA resulted in significantly higher intensity of activation in several regions in both tasks and helped reveal activation in the primary somatosensory and ventral premotor area, theoretically known to become engaged during action observation. In subject-level ROI analyses, gCCA improved the signal to noise ratio in the averaged timeseries in each preselected ROI, and resulted in increased extent of activation, although peak intensity was considerably higher in just two of them. In conclusion, gCCA is a promising method for improving the sensitivity of conventional statistical modeling in task related fMRI experiments.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenia: current evidence, methodological advances, limitations and future directions	WORLD PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; functional magnetic resonance imaging; biomarkers; negative symptoms; functional outcomes; cognition; treatment response; therapeutic mechanisms; precision medicine; clinical utility	RESTING-STATE FMRI; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION THERAPY; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; ULTRA-HIGH-RISK; TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Functional neuroimaging emerged with great promise and has provided fundamental insights into the neurobiology of schizophrenia. However, it has faced challenges and criticisms, most notably a lack of clinical translation. This paper provides a comprehensive review and critical summary of the literature on functional neuroimaging, in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in schizophrenia. We begin by reviewing research on fMRI biomarkers in schizophrenia and the clinical high risk phase through a historical lens, moving from case-control regional brain activation to global connectivity and advanced analytical approaches, and more recent machine learning algorithms to identify predictive neuroimaging features. Findings from fMRI studies of negative symptoms as well as of neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits are then reviewed. Functional neural markers of these symptoms and deficits may represent promising treatment targets in schizophrenia. Next, we summarize fMRI research related to antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions, and neurostimulation, including treatment response and resistance, therapeutic mechanisms, and treatment targeting. We also review the utility of fMRI and data-driven approaches to dissect the heterogeneity of schizophrenia, moving beyond case-control comparisons, as well as methodological considerations and advances, including consortia and precision fMRI. Lastly, limitations and future directions of research in the field are discussed. Our comprehensive review suggests that, in order for fMRI to be clinically useful in the care of patients with schizophrenia, research should address potentially actionable clinical decisions that are routine in schizophrenia treatment, such as which antipsychotic should be prescribed or whether a given patient is likely to have persistent functional impairment. The potential clinical utility of fMRI is influenced by and must be weighed against cost and accessibility factors. Future evaluations of the utility of fMRI in prognostic and treatment response studies may consider including a health economics analysis.

J	Wilzén, J; Eklund, A; Villani, M				Wilzen, Josef; Eklund, Anders; Villani, Mattias			Physiological Gaussian process priors for the hemodynamics in fMRI analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; MCMC; fMRI; Hemodynamics; Gaussian processes; Misspecification	RESPONSE FUNCTION; REGULARIZATION; CHILDREN; MODELS	Background: Inference from fMRI data faces the challenge that the hemodynamic system that relates neural activity to the observed BOLD fMRI signal is unknown. New method: We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the underlying hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled nonparametrically with a Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by physiological information and (iii) the predicted BOLD is not necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We place a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD response, rather than on the hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This allows us to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a flexible way, and simultaneously gives us the nonparametric flexibility of the GP. Results: Results on simulated data show that the proposed model is able to discriminate between active and nonactive voxels also when the GP prior deviates from the true hemodynamics. Our model finds time varying dynamics when applied to real fMRI data. Comparison with existing method(s): The proposed model is better at detecting activity in simulated data than standard models, without inflating the false positive rate. When applied to real fMRI data, our GP model in several cases finds brain activity where previously proposed LTI models does not. Conclusions: We have proposed a new non-linear model for the hemodynamics in task fMRI, that is able to detect active voxels, and gives the opportunity to ask new kinds of questions related to hemodynamics.

Although we have already validated an fMRI-NF protocol targeting the facial expressions processing network (FEPN), its dissemination is hampered by the economical and logistical constraints of fMRI-NF interventions, which may be however surpassed by transferring it to EEG setups, due to their low cost and portability. One of the major challenges of this procedure is then to reconstruct the BOLD-fMRI signal measured at the FEPN using only EEG signals. Because these types of approaches have been poorly explored so far, here we systematically investigated the extent at which the BOLD-fMRI signal recorded from the FEPN during a fMRI-NF protocol could be reconstructed from the simultaneously recorded EEG signal.Approach.Several features from both scalp and source spaces (the latter estimated using continuous EEG source imaging) were extracted and used as predictors in a regression problem using random forests. Furthermore, three different approaches to deal with the hemodynamic delay of the BOLD signal were tested. The resulting models were compared with the only approach already proposed in the literature that uses spectral features and considers different time delays.Main results.The combination of linear and non-linear features (particularly the largest Lyapunov exponent and entropy measures) projected into the source space, spatially filtered by independent component analysis (ICA) and convolved with multiple HRF functions peaking at different latencies, increases significantly the reconstruction accuracy (defined as the correlation between the measured and approximated BOLD signal) from 20% (direct comparison with the method used in the current literature) to 56%.Significance.With this pipeline, a more accurate reconstruction of the BOLD signal can be obtained, which will positively impact the transfer of fMRI-based neurofeedback interventions to EEG setups, and more importantly, their dissemination and efficacy in modulating the activity of the desired brain areas.

However, resting-state fMRI has a bias depending on the scanner site, which makes it difficult to diagnose depression at a new site. In this paper, we propose methods to improve the performance of the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) at an independent site by reducing the site bias effects using regression. For this, we used a subgroup of healthy subjects of the independent site to regress out site bias. We further improved the classification performance of patients with depression by focusing on melancholic depressive disorder. Our proposed methods would be useful to apply depression classifiers to subjects at completely new sites.

This reduces its localization specificity with respect to neuronal responses, a disadvantage for neuroscientific research. Here, we modified a submillimeter BOLD protocol to selectively reduce venous and tissue signal and increase cerebral blood volume weighting through a pulsed saturation scheme (dubbed Arterial Blood Contrast) at 7 T. Adding Arterial Blood Contrast on top of the existing BOLD contrast modulated the intracortical contrast. Isolating the Arterial Blood Contrast showed a response free of pial-surface bias. The results suggest that Arterial Blood Contrast can modulate the typical fMRI spatial specificity, with important applications in in-vivo neuroscience.

Precision medicine in pediatric temporal epilepsy surgery: optimization of outcomes through functional MRI memory tasks and tailored surgeries	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						surgical epilepsy; temporal lobe epilepsy; fMRI; memory outcomes; precision medicine	LOBE EPILEPSY; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; AMERICAN ACADEMY; VERBAL MEMORY; CHILDREN; RESECTION; ADULTS; FMRI	OBJECTIVE The goal of epilepsy surgery is both seizure cessation and maximal preservation of function. In temporal lobe (TL) cases, the lack of functional MRI (fMRI) tasks that effectively activate mesial temporal structures hampers pre-operative memory risk assessment, especially in children. This study evaluated pediatric TL surgery outcome optimiza-tion associated with tailored resection informed by an fMRI memory task.METHODS The authors identified focal onset TL epilepsy patients with 1) TL resections; 2) viable fMRI memory scans; and 3) pre-and postoperative neuropsychological (NP) evaluations. They retrospectively evaluated preoperative fMRI memory scans, available Wada tests, pre-and postoperative NP scores, postoperative MRI scans, and postoperative Engel class outcomes. To assess fMRI memory task outcome prediction, the authors 1) overlaid preoperative fMRI activation onto postoperative structural images; 2) classified patients as having "overlap" or "no overlap" of activation and resection cavities; and 3) compared these findings with memory improvement, stability, or decline, based on Reliable Change Index calculations.RESULTS Twenty patients met the inclusion criteria. At a median of 2.1 postoperative years, 16 patients had Engel class IA outcomes and 1 each had Engel class IB, ID, IIA, and IID outcomes. Functional MRI activation was linked to NP memory outcome in 19 of 20 cases (95%). Otherwise, heterogeneity characterized the cohort.CONCLUSIONS Functional MRI memory task activation effectively predicted individual NP outcomes in the context of tailored TL resections. Patients had excellent seizure and overall good NP outcomes. This small study adds to extant literature indicating that pediatric TL epilepsy does not represent a single clinical syndrome. Findings support individual-ized surgical intervention using fMRI memory activation to help guide this precision medicine approach.

Emerging fMRI-based evidence suggests that the brain is also affected by CSM. This systematic review aimed to understand the usefulness of brain fMRI in CSM. A comprehensive literature search was conducted until March 2023 according to PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion criteria included original research articles in English, primarily studying the human brain's functional changes in CSM using fMRI with at least 5 participants. The extracted data from each study included demographics, disease severity, MRI machine characteristics, affected brain areas, functional changes, and clinical utilities. A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the fMRI methods, resting-state fMRI was the most widely used experimental paradigm, followed by motor tasks. The brain areas associated with motor control were most affected in CSM, followed by the superior frontal gyrus and occipital cortex. Functional changes in the brain were correlated to clinical metrics showing clinical utility. However, the evidence that a specific fMRI metric correlating with a clinical metric was "very low" to "insufficient" due to a low number of studies and negative results. In conclusion, fMRI can potentially facilitate the diagnosis of CSM by quantitatively interrogating the functional changes of the brain, particularly areas of the brain associated with motor control. However, this field is in its early stages, and more studies are needed to establish the usefulness of brain fMRI in CSM.

Denoising task-related fMRI: Balancing noise reduction against signal loss	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						noise-reduction techniques; pain; systemic physiological changes; task-related fMRI	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MOTION CORRECTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; ICA-AROMA; PAIN; ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; ACQUISITION	Preprocessing fMRI data requires striking a fine balance between conserving signals of interest and removing noise. Typical steps of preprocessing include motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing, and high-pass filtering. However, these standard steps do not remove many sources of noise. Thus, noise-reduction techniques, for example, CompCor, FIX, and ICA-AROMA have been developed to further improve the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The ability of these techniques to minimize noise while conserving signals of interest has been tested almost exclusively in resting-state fMRI and, only rarely, in task-related fMRI. Application of noise-reduction techniques to task-related fMRI is particularly important given that such procedures have been shown to reduce false positive rates. Little remains known about the impact of these techniques on the retention of signal in tasks that may be associated with systemic physiological changes. In this paper, we compared two ICA-based, that is FIX and ICA-AROMA, two CompCor-based noise-reduction techniques, that is aCompCor, and tCompCor, and standard preprocessing using a large (n = 101) fMRI dataset including noxious heat and non-noxious auditory stimulation. Results show that preprocessing using FIX performs optimally for data obtained using noxious heat, conserving more signals than CompCor-based techniques and ICA-AROMA, while removing only slightly less noise. Similarly, for data obtained during non-noxious auditory stimulation, FIX noise-reduction technique before analysis with a covariate of interest outperforms the other techniques. These results indicate that FIX might be the most appropriate technique to achieve the balance between conserving signals of interest and removing noise during task-related fMRI.	[Hoeppli, M.

Utilizing deep learning techniques, the quality of reconstructed images can be significantly improved. This however is subject to availability of sufficient number of pair samples, which is not currently the case. In this study, we propose to perform alternating encoding and decoding to realize the mutual promotion of both based on shared semi-supervised learning and accomplish better reconstruction of natural images from the corresponding fMRI voxels. In our proposed method, the encoder and decoder are used to respectively map the images to the fMRI voxels (visual encoding), and the fMRI voxels to the images (visual reconstruction). We argue that combining the encoder and decoder in different sequences can form two converse and shared autoencoders to regularize the supervised learning of both through the unsupervised learning of fMRI voxels and images. More importantly, we alternatingly train the encoder and decoder with shared autoencoder regularization. Here, the premise is that a better encoder can produce a better decoder, and vice versa. The pixel level identification of the proposed method achieves up to 89.5%, which indicates at least 2% superiority and is the new state-of-the-art compared to the previous works in terms of the image reconstruction performance.

We used word encoding, word recognition, image encoding, and image recognition memory tasks, and semantic description, reading comprehension, and listening comprehension language tasks. We used three common lateralization metrics: network spatial distribution, maximum statistical value, and laterality index (LI).Results: Lateralization of signal spatial distribution resulted in poor similarity between verbal memory and language fMRI tasks. Signal maximum lateralization showed significant (>.8) but not perfect (1) similarity. Word encoding LI showed significant correlation only with listening comprehension LI (p = .016). Word recognition LI was significantly correlated with expressive language semantic description LI (p = .024) and receptive language reading and listening comprehension LIs (p = .015 and p = .019, respectively). There was no correlation between LIs of the visuospatial tasks and LIs of the language tasks.Conclusions: Our results support the association between language and verbal memory lateralization, optimally determined by LI quantification, and the introduction of quantitative means for language fMRI interpretation in clinical settings where verbal memory lateralization is imperative.

While there have been many developments for statistical models of dFC in resting-state fMRI, there remains a gap in the literature on how to simultaneously model both dFC and time-varying activation when the study participants are undergoing experimental tasks designed to probe at a cognitive process of interest. A method is proposed to estimate dFC between two regions of interest (ROIs) in task-based fMRI where the activation effects are also allowed to vary over time. The proposed method, called TVAAC (time-varying activation and connectivity), uses penalized splines to model both time-varying activation effects and time-varying functional connectivity and uses the bootstrap for statistical inference. Simulation studies show that TVAAC can estimate both static and time-varying activation and functional connectivity, while ignoring time-varying activation effects would lead to poor estimation of dFC. An empirical illustration is provided by applying TVAAC to analyze two subjects from an event-related fMRI learning experiment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the nature of the functional networks revealed by BOLD fMRI can be ambiguous, as highlighted by a recent series of experiments that have suggested that typical resting-state networks can be replicated from purely vascular or physiologically driven BOLD signals. After going through a brief review of the key concepts of brain network analysis, we explore how the vascular and neuronal systems interact to give rise to the brain functional networks measured with BOLD fMRI. This leads us to emphasize a view of the vascular network not only as a confounding element in fMRI but also as a functionally relevant system that is entangled with the neuronal network. To study the vascular and neuronal underpinnings of BOLD functional connectivity, we consider a combination of methodological avenues based on multiscale and multimodal optical imaging in mice, used in combination with computational models that allow the integration of vascular information to explain functional connectivity.

To spatio-temporally resolve cardiac signals in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series of the human brain using neither external physiological measurements nor ad hoc modelling assumptions. Approach. Cardiac pulsation is a physiological confound of fMRI time-series that introduces spurious signal fluctuations in proximity to blood vessels. fMRI alone is not sufficiently fast to resolve cardiac pulsation. Depending on the ratio between the instantaneous heart-rate and the acquisition sampling frequency (1/TR, with TR being the repetition time), the cardiac signal may alias into the frequency band of neural activation so that its removal through spectral filtering techniques is generally not possible. In this paper, we show that it is feasible to temporally and spatially resolve cardiac signals throughout the brain even when cardiac aliasing occurs by combining fMRI hyper-sampling with simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging. The technique, which we name WHOle-brain CArdiac signal REgression from highly accelerated simultaneous multi-Slice fMRI acquisitions (WHOCARES), was developed on 695 healthy subjects selected from the Human Connectome Project and its performance validated against the RETROICOR, HAPPY and the pulse oxymeter signal regression methods. Main results. WHOCARES is capable of retrieving voxel-wise cardiac signal regressors. This is achieved without employing external physiological recordings nor through ad hoc modelling assumptions. The performance of WHOCARES was, on average, superior to RETROICOR, HAPPY and the pulse oxymeter regression methods. Significance. WHOCARES holds basis for the reliable mapping of cardiac activity in fMRI time-series. WHOCARES can be employed for the retrospective removal of cardiac noise in publicly available fMRI datasets where physiological recordings are not available.

However, optimized response for different clinical indications may depend on specific neuromodulation parameters, and systematic assessments of their influence are still needed to optimize this promising approach. Hypothesis: We proposed that stimulation frequency would have a significant effect on nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) functional MRI (fMRI) response to respiratory-gated taVNS (RAVANS). Methods: Brainstem fMRI response to auricular RAVANS (cymba conchae) was assessed for four different stimulation frequencies (2, 10, 25, 100 Hz). Sham (no current) stimulation was used to control for respiration effects on fMRI signal. Results: Our findings demonstrated that RAVANS delivered at 100 Hz evoked the strongest brainstem response, localized to a cluster in the left (ipsilateral) medulla and consistent with purported NTS. A co-localized, although weaker, response was found for 2 Hz RAVANS. Furthermore, RAVANS delivered at 100 Hz also evoked stronger fMRI responses for important monoamine neurotransmitter source nuclei (LC, noradrenergic; MR, DR, serotonergic) and pain/homeostatic regulation nuclei (i.e. PAG). Conclusion: Our fMRI results support previous localization of taVNS afference to pontomedullary aspect of NTS in the human brainstem, and demonstrate the significant influence of the stimulation frequency on brainstem fMRI response.

Temporal non-local means filtering for studies of intrinsic brain connectivity from individual resting fMRI	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Connectivity; FMRI; Non-local means filtering; Optimization	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; CORTEX	Characterizing functional brain connectivity using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging due to the relatively small Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent contrast and low signal-to-noise ratio. Denoising using surface-based Laplace-Beltrami (LB) or volumetric Gaussian filtering tends to blur boundaries between different functional areas. To overcome this issue, a time-based Non-Local Means (tNLM) filtering method was previously developed to denoise fMRI data while preserving spatial structure. The kernel and parameters that define the tNLM filter need to be optimized for each application. Here we present a novel Global PDF-based tNLM filtering (GPDF) algorithm that uses a data-driven kernel function based on a Bayes factor to optimize filtering for spatial delineation of functional connectivity in resting fMRI data. We demonstrate its performance relative to Gaussian spatial filtering and the original tNLM filtering via simulations. We also compare the effects of GPDF filtering against LB filtering using individual in-vivo resting fMRI datasets. Our results show that LB filtering tends to blur signals across boundaries between adjacent functional regions. In contrast, GPDF filtering enables improved noise reduction without blurring adjacent functional regions. These results indicate that GPDF may be a useful preprocessing tool for analyses of brain connectivity and network topology in individual fMRI recordings. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we utilize 7 Tesla fMRI to examine the neural substrates of meditation and replicate existing widespread findings, after accounting for relevant physiological confounds.Methods: In this feasibility study, we scanned 10 beginner meditators (N = 10) while they either attended to breathing (focused attention meditation) or engaged in restful thinking (non-focused rest). We also measured and adjusted the fMRI signal for key physiological differences between meditation and rest. Finally, we explored changes in state mindfulness, state anxiety and focused attention attributes for up to 2 weeks following the single fMRI meditation session.Results: Group-level task fMRI analyses revealed significant reductions in activity during meditation relative to rest in default-mode network hubs, i.e., antero-medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, precuneus, as well as visual and thalamic regions. These findings survived stringent statistical corrections for fluctuations in physiological responses which demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) between meditation and rest. Compared to baseline, State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores were significantly elevated (F (3,9) = 8.16, p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) following the fMRI meditation session, and were closely maintained at 2-week follow up.Conclusions: This pilot study establishes the feasibility and utility of investigating focused attention meditation using ultra-high field (7 Tesla) fMRI, by supporting widespread evidence that focused attention meditation attenuates default-mode activity responsible for self-referential processing. Future functional neuroimaging studies of meditation should control for physiological confounds and include behavioural assessments.

As more researchers come to view the brain as a complex dynamical system, tools are increasingly being drawn from other fields to characterize the complexity of the brain's activity. However, given that the signal measured with rs-fMRI arises from the hemodynamic response to neural activity, the extent to which complexity metrics reflect neural complexity as compared to signal properties related to image quality remains unknown. To provide some insight into this question, correlation dimension, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent were calculated for different rs-fMRI scans from the same subject to examine their reliability. The metrics of complexity were then compared to several properties of the rs-fMRI signal from each brain area to determine if basic signal features could explain differences in the complexity metrics. Differences in complexity across brain areas were highly reliable and were closely linked to differences in the frequency profiles of the rs-fMRI signal. The spatial distributions of the complexity and frequency metrics suggest that they are both influenced by location-dependent signal properties that can obscure changes related to neural activity.

Registration to an individual space can avoid this problem. However, in the current fMRI registration algorithm based on individual space, the reference image is often selected by researchers or randomly selected fMRI images at a certain time point. This makes the quality of the reference image very dependent on the experience and ability of the researchers and has great contingency. Whether the reference image is appropriate and reasonable affects the rationality and accuracy of the registration results to a great extent. Therefore, a method for constructing a 3D custom fMRI template is proposed. First, the data are preprocessed; second, by taking a group of two-dimensional slices corresponding to the same layer of the brain in three-dimensional fMRI images at multiple time points as image sequences, each group of slice sequences are registered and fused; and finally, a group of fused slices corresponding to different layers of the brain are obtained. In the process of registration, in order to make full use of the correlation information between the sequence data, the feature points of each two slices of adjacent time points in the sequence are matched, and then according to the transformation relationship between the adjacent images, they are recursively forwarded and mapped to the same space. Then, the fused slices are stacked in order to form a three-dimensional customized fMRI template with individual pertinence. Finally, in the classic registration algorithm, the difference in the registration accuracy between using a custom fMRI template and different standard spaces is compared, which proves that using a custom template can improve the registration effect to a certain extent.

To validate our overt continuous speech paradigm, we mapped the speech production network (SPN) in typical speakers (n = 19, 10 females) and speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria as a manifestation of Parkinson disease (HKD; n = 21, 8 females) in fMRI. We then compared it with the SPN derived during overt speech production by O-15-water PET in the same group of typical speakers and another HKD cohort (n = 10, 2 females). The fMRI overt connected speech paradigm did not result in excessive motion artifacts and successfully identified the same brain areas demonstrated in the PET studies in the two cohorts. The SPN derived in fMRI demonstrated significant spatial overlap with the corresponding PET derived maps (typical speakers: r = 0.52; speakers with HKD: r = 0.43) and identified the components of the neural circuit of speech production belonging to the feedforward and feedback subsystems. The fMRI study in speakers with HKD identified significantly decreased activity in critical feedforward (bilateral dorsal premotor and motor cortices) and feedback (auditory and somatosensory areas) subsystems replicating previous PET study findings in this cohort. These results demonstrate that the overt connected speech paradigm is feasible during fMRI and can accurately localize the neural substrates of typical and disordered speech production. Our fMRI paradigm should prove useful for study of motor speech and voice disorders, including stuttering, apraxia of speech, dysarthria, and spasmodic dysphonia.

This paper explores recent reports on using advanced simultaneous EEG-fMRI methods proposed to map the regions and networks involved in focal epileptic seizure generation. One of the applications of EEG and fMRI combination as a valuable clinical approach is the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy to map and localize the precise brain regions associated with epileptiform activity. In the process of conventional analysis using EEG-fMRI data, the interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are visually extracted from the EEG data to be convolved as binary events with a predefined hemodynamic response function (HRF) to provide a model of epileptiform BOLD activity and use as a regressor for general linear model (GLM) analysis of the fMRI data. This review examines the methodologies involved in performing such studies, including techniques used for the recording of EEG inside the scanner, artifact removal, and statistical analysis of the fMRI signal. It then discusses the results reported for patients with primary generalized epilepsy and patients with different types of focal epileptic disorders. An important matter that these results have brought to light is that the brain regions affected by interictal epileptic discharges might not be limited to the ones where they have been generated. The developed methods can help reveal the regions involved in or affected by a seizure onset zone (SOZ). As confirmed by the reviewed literature, EEG-fMRI provides information that comes particularly useful when evaluating patients with refractory epilepsy for surgery.

What may be surprising is that higher imaging resolution may provide both higher specificity and sensitivity due to reductions in partial volume effects and reduced physiological noise. However, challenges remain to ensure high data quality and to reduce variability in ultra-high field fMRI. We discuss session-specific biases including those caused by factors related to instrumentation, anatomy, and physiology-which can translate into variability across sessions-and how to minimize these to help ultra-high field fMRI reach its full potential for individual-focused studies.

However, recent advances in ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have made it feasible to reasonably resolve layer-specific fMRI signals with sub-millimeter resolution. Here, we propose an experimental and analytical framework that enables the noninvasive functional characterization of layer-specific cortical microcircuits. Specifically, we illustrate this framework by characterizing layer-specific functional pathways in the corticogeniculate network of the human visual system by obtaining sub-millimeter fMRI at 7T using a task which engages the magnocellular pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex. Our results demonstrate that: (i) center-surround inhibition in magnocellular neurons within LGN is detectable using localized fMRI responses; (ii) feedforward (LGN -> layers VI/IV, layer IV -> layer VI) and feedback (layer VI -> LGN) functional pathways, known to exist from invasive animal studies, can be inferred using dynamic directional connectivity models of fMRI and could potentially explain the mechanism underlying center-surround inhibition as well as gain control by layer VI in the human visual system. Our framework is domain-neutral and could potentially be employed to investigate the layer-specific cortical microcircuits in other systems related to cognition, memory and language.

The efforts to monitor and predict treatment outcome in participants with obesity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) depends on the reliability of the investigated task-fMRI brain activation. To date, no study has investigated whole-brain reliability of neural food cue-reactivity. To close this gap, we analyzed the longitudinal reliability of an established food cue-reactivity task. Longitudinal reliability of neural food-cue-induced brain activation and subjective food craving ratings over three fMRI sessions (T0: 2 weeks before surgery, T1: 8 weeks and T2: 24 weeks after surgery) were investigated in N = 11 participants with obesity. We computed an array of established reliability estimates, including the intraclass correlation (ICC), the Dice and Jaccard coefficients and similarity of brain activation maps. The data indicated good reliability (ICC > 0.6) of subjective food craving ratings over 26 weeks and excellent reliability (ICC > 0.75) of brain activation signals for the contrast of interest (food > neutral) in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, middle cingulum, inferior, middle and superior occipital gyri, and middle and superior temporal gyri and cunei. Using similarity estimates, it was possible to re-identify individuals based on their neural activation maps (73%) with a fading degree of accuracy, when comparing fMRI sessions further apart. The results show excellent reliability of task-fMRI neural brain activation in several brain regions. Current data suggest that fMRI-based measures might indeed be suitable to monitor and predict treatment outcome in participants with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery.

Optimizing data processing to improve the reproducibility of single-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						functional magnetic resonance imaging; motion correction; reproducibility; spatial smoothing	LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; VISUAL ACTIVATION; MOTION CORRECTION; FMRI ACTIVATION; RELIABILITY; VARIABILITY; SOFTWARE; IMPLEMENTATION; LOCALIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Introduction High reproducibility is critical for ensuring the confidence needed to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps for presurgical planning. Methods In this study, the comparison of different motion correction methods, spatial smoothing methods, regression methods, and thresholding methods was performed to see whether specific data processing methods can be employed to improve the reproducibility of single-subject fMRI activation. Three test-retest metrics were used: the percent difference in activation volume (PDAV), the difference in the center of mass (DCM), and the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results The PDAV was minimized when using little or no spatial smoothing and AMPLE thresholding. The DCM was minimized when using affine motion correction and little or no spatial smoothing. The DSC was improved when using affine motion correction and generous spatial smoothing. However, it is believed that the overlap metric may be unsuitable for testing fMRI reproducibility. Conclusion Processing methods to improve fMRI reproducibility were determined. Importantly, the processing methods needed to improve reproducibility were dependent on the fMRI activation metric of interest.

Functional MRI (fMRI) is considered the most useful to determine language lateralization noninvasively. However, there are no standardized language fMRI protocols, and several issues remain unresolved. In particular, the language tasks normally used are predominantly active paradigms that require the overt participation of patients, making assessment difficult for pediatric patients or patients with intellectual disabilities. In this study, task-based fMRI with passive narrative listening was applied to evaluate speech comprehension to estimate language function in Japanese-speaking patients with drug-resistant TLE. Methods: Twenty-one patients (six with intellectual disabilities) participated. Patients listened to passive auditory stimuli with combinations of forward and silent playback, and forward and backward playback. The activation results were extracted using a block design, and lateralization indices were calculated. The obtained fMRI results were compared to the results of the Wada test. Results: The concordance rate between fMRI and the Wada test was 95.2%. Meaningful responses were successfully obtained even from participants with intellectual disabilities. Conclusions: This passive fMRI paradigm can provide safe and easy presurgical language evaluation, particularly for individuals who may not readily engage in active paradigms.

Despite the evidence, no study has attempted to understand the compensatory process in light of 'formal' models of compensation. We used a quantitative model of compensation - the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH), to characterise compensation in pre-HD using fMRI. Pre-HD individuals (n = 15) and controls (n = 15) performed a modified stop-signal task that incremented in four levels of stop difficulty. Our results did not support the critical assumption of the CRUNCH model - controls did not show increased fMRI activity with increased level of stop difficulty; however, controls showed decreased fMRI activity with increased stop difficulty in right inferior frontal gyrus and right caudate nucleus. Relative to controls, pre-HD individuals showed increased fMRI activity in right inferior frontal gyrus and in right caudate nucleus at higher levels of stop difficulty, which is the opposite effect to that predicted by the model. Our findings suggest a compensatory process of the response inhibition network in pre-HD; however, the pattern of fMRI activity was not in the manner expected by CRUNCH.

Jon			Mapping of whole-cerebrum resting-state networks using ultra-high resolution acquisition protocols	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EPIK; half-mm in-plane resolution; resting-state fMRI; TR-external phase correction; whole-cerebrum	HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; ECHO; BOLD; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; EPI	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used in numerous studies to map networks in the brain that employ spatially disparate regions. However, attempts to map networks with high spatial resolution have been hampered by conflicting technical demands and associated problems. Results from recent fMRI studies have shown that spatial resolution remains around 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm(3), with only partial brain coverage. Therefore, this work aims to present a novel fMRI technique that was developed based on echo-planar-imaging with keyhole (EPIK) combined with repetition-time-external (TR-external) EPI phase correction. Each technique has been previously shown to be effective in enhancing the spatial resolution of fMRI, and in this work, the combination of the two techniques into TR-external EPIK provided a nominal spatial resolution of 0.51 x 0.51 x 1.00 mm(3) (0.26 mm(3) voxel) with whole-cerebrum coverage. Here, the feasibility of using half-millimetre in-plane TR-external EPIK for resting-state fMRI was validated using 13 healthy subjects and the corresponding reproducible mapping of resting-state networks was demonstrated. Furthermore, TR-external EPIK enabled the identification of various resting-state networks distributed throughout the brain from a single fMRI session, with mapping fidelity onto the grey matter at 7T. The high-resolution functional image further revealed mesoscale anatomical structures, such as small cerebral vessels and the internal granular layer of the cortex within the postcentral gyrus.

One of the most commonly used methods to explore the RS-fMRI signal is the Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (PICA). PICA allows to depict brain functional connectivity (FC) networks. Yet most of the IC maps obtained with this method do not represent any particular FC network. Consequently, those IC maps are classified as artifacts or noise of an unknown source. We hypothesized that the unexplained RS-fMRI signal patterns that are picked up by the PICA can be related to the differences in oxygen metabolism and blood flow in cortical layers. This study aimed at (1) providing preliminary evidence to the effects of laminar organization of neocortex on the RS-fMRI signal, and (2) evaluating the application of laminar maps to aid the classification of IC maps. We created laminar maps 1-4 that depict relative cortical thickness of layers IV and VI. Our data show that the RS-fMRI signal is significantly related to the relative thickness of the cortical layer VI but not layer IV. Importantly, the laminar maps 1-4 overlap with four separate IC maps. Thus, the laminar maps 1-4 improve classification and interpretation of the IC maps. Moreover, the laminar maps 1-4 may be considered as FC networks that are the bridging piece between particular cognitive functions. Together, these data provide preliminary evidence to the fundamental questions about the role of cortical layering in the RS-fMRI signal and brain FC networks.

Statistical methods that simultaneously model temporal and spatial variations of fMRI data are promising tools for dynamic functional connectivity (FC) estimation. Although different approaches are available, they need to manually set the parameters, or may disregard some important fMRI features such as the autocorrelation. In addition, no reliable method exists for the validation of dynamic FC analysis models.Approach. In the present study, we have proposed an autoregressive dynamic conditional correlation model to deal with the temporal autocorrelation and non-stationarity in fMRI time-series. This model assumes that the brain time courses follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and that the conditional mean, variance and covariances change in an autoregressive form. Also, we proposed a new measurement index for the evaluation of the statistical consistency between the inferred dynamic functional connectivity and the real fMRI data. The performance of our model was tested in both simulated and real fMRI data.Main results.The model was associated with independent Gaussian residuals, and identified the dynamic connectivity patterns with high precision. Applying the model to the fMRI data from typically developing and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder subjects, brain connectivities were significantly different between the two groups.Significance.Prominent features of our model were the consideration of the fMRI autocorrelation, no need to adjust the window length, and also elimination of the variance changes in each brain time-course from its connectivity changes.

Sensitivity limitations of high-resolution perfusion-based human fMRI at 7 Tesla	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Perfusion imaging; High-resolution fMRI; Blood oxygenation-level dependent fMRI; Cerebral blood flow-based fMRI	OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; BOLD FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; BLOOD-FLOW; SPIN-ECHO; SIGNAL; ACTIVATION; GRADIENT; CONTRAST; FIELD	The study of the brain's functional organization at laminar and columnar level of the cortex with blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) is affected by the contribution of large veins downstream from the microvascular response to brain activity. Blood volume-and especially perfusion-based techniques may reduce this problem because of their reduced sensitivity to venous effects, but may not allow the same spatial resolution because of smaller signal changes associated with brain activity. Here we investigated the practical resolution limits of perfusion-weighted fMRI in human visual stimulation experiments. For this purpose, we used a highly sensitive, single-shot perfusion labeling (SSPL) technique at 7 T and compared sensitivity to detect visual activation at low (2 mm, n = 10) and high (1 mm, n = 8) nominal isotropic spatial, and 3 s temporal, resolution with BOLD in 51/2-minute-long experiments. Despite the smaller absolute signal change with activation, 2 mm resolution SSPL yielded comparable sensitivity to BOLD. This was attributed to a superior suppression of physiological noise with SSPL. However, at 1 mm nominal resolution, SSPL sensitivity fell on average at least 42% below that of BOLD, and detection of visual activation was compromised. This is explained by the fact that at high resolution, with both techniques, typically thermal noise rather than physiological noise dominates sensitivity. The observed sensitivity loss implies that to perform 1-mm resolution, perfusion weighted fMRI with a robustness similar to BOLD, scan times that are almost 3 times longer than the comparable BOLD experiment are required. This is in line with or slightly better than previous comparisons between perfusion weighted fMRI and BOLD. The lower sensitivity has to be weighed against the spatial fidelity advantages of high-resolution perfusion-weighted fMRI.

Currently, general linear model (GLM), independent component analysis (ICA), sparse dictionary learning, and recently deep learning models, are major methods for fMRI data analysis in either spatial or temporal domains, but there are few joint spatial-temporal methods proposed, as far as we know. As a result, the 4-D nature of fMRI data has not been effectively investigated due to this methodological gap. The recent success of deep learning applications for functional brain decoding and encoding greatly inspired us in this paper to propose a novel framework called spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (ST-CNN) to extract both spatial and temporal characteristics from targeted networks jointly and automatically identify of functional networks. The identification of default mode network (DMN) from fMRI data was used for evaluation of the proposed framework. Results show that only training the framework on one fMRI data set is sufficiently generalizable to identify the DMN from different data sets of different cognitive tasks and resting state. Further investigation of the results shows that the joint-learning scheme can capture the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal characteristics of DMN and thus it ensures the accurate identification of DMN from independent data sets. The ST-CNN model brings new tools and insights for fMRI analysis in cognitive and clinical neuroscience studies.

Emotional faces processing in major depressive disorder and prediction of antidepressant treatment response: A NeuroPharm study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Major depressive disorder; SSRI; fMRI; amygdala; antidepressant; emotional faces	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; AMYGDALA REACTIVITY; RATING-SCALE; BRAIN; HETEROGENEITY; HABITUATION; ACTIVATION; NETWORK; BINDING; BURDEN	Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric illness for which it is important to resolve underlying brain mechanisms. Current treatments are often unsuccessful, precipitating a need to identify predictive markers. Aim: We evaluated (1) alterations in brain responses to an emotional faces functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm in individuals with MDD, compared to controls, (2) whether pretreatment brain responses predicted antidepressant treatment response, and (3) pre-post change in brain responses following treatment. Methods: Eighty-nine medication-free, depressed individuals and 115 healthy controls completed the fMRI paradigm. Depressed individuals completed a nonrandomized, open-label, 8-week treatment with escitalopram, including the option to switch to duloxetine after 4 weeks. We examined patientcontrol group differences in regional fMRI responses at baseline, whether baseline fMRI responses predicted treatment response at 8weeks, including early life stress moderating effects, and change in fMRI responses in 36 depressed individuals rescanned following 8weeks of treatment. Results: Task reaction time was 5% slower in patients. Multiple brain regions showed significant task-related responses, but we observed no statistically significant patient-control group differences (Cohen's d <0.35). Patient pretreatment brain responses did not predict antidepressant treatment response (area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) <0.6) and brain responses were not statistically significantly changed after treatment (Cohen's d < 0.33). Conclusion: This represents the largest prediction study to date examining emotional faces fMRI features as predictors of antidepressant treatment response. Brain response to this fMRI emotional faces paradigm did not distinguish depressed individuals from healthy controls, nor was it predictive of antidepressant treatment response.

However, the typical, asymmetrical and mass-univariate approach cannot capture the inherent, higher order structure in the EEG data, nor multivariate relations in the fMRI data, and it is nontrivial to accurately handle varying neurovascular coupling over patients and brain regions. We aim to overcome these drawbacks in a data-driven manner by means of a novel structured matrix-tensor factorization: the single-subject EEG data (represented as a third-order spectrogram tensor) and fMRI data (represented as a spatiotemporal BOLD signal matrix) are jointly decomposed into a superposition of several sources, characterized by space-time-frequency profiles. In the shared temporal mode, Toeplitz-structured factors account for a spatially specific, neurovascular 'bridge' between the EEG and fMRI temporal fluctuations, capturing the hemodynamic response's variability over brain regions. By analyzing interictal data from twelve patients, we show that the extracted source signatures provide a sensitive localization of the ictal onset zone (10/12). Moreover, complementary parts of the IOZ can be uncovered by inspecting those regions with the most deviant neurovascular coupling, as quantified by two entropy-like metrics of the hemodynamic response function waveforms (9/12). Hence, this multivariate, multimodal factorization provides two useful sets of EEG-fMRI biomarkers, which can assist the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.

Methods An improved, completely self-navigated version of the TURBINE sampling scheme was designed for fMRI at 7 Telsa. To demonstrate the image quality and spatial specificity of the acquisition, thin-slab visual and motor BOLD fMRI at 0.67 mm isotropic resolution (16 mm slab, TRvol = 2.32 s), and 0.8 x 0.8 x 2.0 mm (whole-brain, TRvol = 2.4 s) data were acquired. To prioritize the high spatial fidelity, we employed a temporally regularized reconstruction to improve sensitivity without any spatial bias. Results TURBINE images provide high structural fidelity with almost no distortion, dropout, or T-2* blurring for the thin-slab acquisitions compared to conventional 3D EPI owing to the radial sampling in-plane and the short echo train used. This results in activation that can be localized to pre- and postcentral gyri in a motor task, for example, with excellent correspondence to brain structure measured by a T-1-MPRAGE. The benefits of TURBINE (low distortion, dropout, blurring) are reduced for the whole-brain acquisition due to the longer EPI train. We demonstrate robust BOLD activation at 0.67 mm isotropic resolution (thin-slab) and also anisotropic 0.8 x 0.8 x 2.0 mm (whole-brain) acquisitions. Conclusion TURBINE is a promising acquisition approach for high-resolution, minimally distorted fMRI at 7 Tesla and could be particularly useful for fMRI in areas of high B-0 inhomogeneity.

However, fMRI maps related to Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IED) commonly show multiple regions of signal change rather than focal ones. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) can estimate effective connectivity, i.e. the causal effects exerted by one brain region over another, based on fMRI data. Here, we employed DCM on fMRI data in 10 focal epilepsy patients with multiple IED-related regions of BOLD signal change, to test whether this approach can help the localization process of EZ. For each subject, a family of competing deterministic, plausible DCM models were constructed using IED as autonomous input at each node, one at time. The DCM findings were compared to the presurgical evaluation results and classified as: "Concordant" if the node identified by DCM matches the presumed focus, "Discordant" if the node is distant from the presumed focus, or "Inconclusive" (no statistically significant result). Furthermore, patients who subsequently underwent intracranial EEG recordings or surgery were considered as having an independent validation of DCM results. The effective connectivity focus identified using DCM was Concordant in 7 patients, Discordant in two cases and Inconclusive in one. In four of the 6 patients operated, the DCM findings were validated. Notably, the two Discordant and Invalidated results were found in patients with poor surgical outcome. Our findings provide preliminary evidence to support the applicability of DCM on fMRI data to investigate the epileptic networks in focal epilepsy and, particularly, to identify the EZ in complex cases.

Recordings consist of single neurons, local field potential, and intracranial EEG activity acquired from depth electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial frontal cortex implanted for monitoring of epileptic seizures. Participants watched an 8-min long excerpt from the video "Bang! You're Dead" and performed a recognition memory test for movie content. 3 T fMRI activity was recorded prior to surgery in 11 of these participants while performing the same task. This NWB- and BIDS-formatted dataset includes spike times, field potential activity, behavior, eye tracking, electrode locations, demographics, and functional and structural MRI scans. For technical validation, we provide signal quality metrics, assess eye tracking quality, behavior, the tuning of cells and high-frequency broadband power field potentials to familiarity and event boundaries, and show brain-wide inter-subject correlations for fMRI. This dataset will facilitate the investigation of brain activity during movie watching, recognition memory, and the neural basis of the fMRI-BOLD signal.

Equipment Setup and Artifact Removal for Simultaneous Electroencephalogram and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Clinical Review in Epilepsy	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Review							DELTA ACTIVITY; EEG; FMRI; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Simultaneous electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is a unique combined technique that provides synergy in the understanding and localization of seizure onset in epilepsy. However, reported experimental protocols for EEG-fMRI recordings fail to address details about conducting such procedures on epilepsy patients. In addition, these protocols are limited solely to research settings. To fill the gap between patient monitoring in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) and conducting research with an epilepsy patient, we introduce a unique EEG-fMRI recording protocol of epilepsy during the interictal period. The use of an MR conditional electrode set, which can also be used in the EMU for a simultaneous scalp EEG and video recording, allows an easy transition of EEG recordings from the EMU to the scanning room for concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings. Details on the recording procedures using this specific MR conditional electrode set are provided. In addition, the study explains step-by-step EEG processing procedures to remove the imaging artifacts, which can then be used for clinical review. This experimental protocol promotes an amendment to the conventional EEG-fMRI recording for enhanced applicability in both clinical (i.e., EMU) and research settings. Furthermore, this protocol provides the potential to expand this modality to postictal EEG-fMRI recordings in the clinical setting.

However, exploring the test-retest reliability of the metrics derived from the rs-fMRI BOLD signal is essential, particularly in the studies of patients with neurological disorders. Here, two factors, namely, the effect of anesthesia and scan length, have been estimated on the reliability of rs-fMRI measurements. A total of nine patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) requiring interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) were scanned in two states. The first scan was performed in an awake state before surgery on the same patient. The second scan was performed 2 weeks later under general anesthesia necessary for LITT surgery. At each state, two rs-fMRI sessions were obtained that each one lasted 15 min, and the effect of scan length was evaluated. Voxel-wise rs-fMRI metrics, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), functional connectivity (FC), and regional homogeneity (ReHo), were measured. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to estimate the reliability of the measurements in two states of awake and under anesthesia. Overall, it appeared that the reliability of rs-fMRI metrics improved under anesthesia. From the 15-min data, we found mean ICC values in awake state including 0.81, 0.51, 0.65, and 0.84 for ALFF, fALFF, FC, and ReHo, respectively, as well as 0.80, 0.59, 0.83, and 0.88 for ALFF, fALFF, FC, and ReHo, respectively, under anesthesia. Additionally, our findings revealed that reliability increases as the function of scan length. We showed that the optimized scan length to achieve less variability of rs-fMRI measurements was 3.1-7.5 min shorter in an anesthetized, compared to a wakeful state.

Comparison of Whole-Head Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy With Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Potential Application in Pediatric Neurology	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						fNIRS; fMRI; Motor cortex; Auditory cortex; Functional cortical activity	AUTOREGULATION MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; FMRI; NIRS; RESPONSES; BOLD	Background: Changes in cerebral blood flow in response to neuronal activation can be measured by time dependent fluctuations in hemoglobin species within the brain; this is the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). There is a clinical need for portable neural imaging systems, such as fNIRS, to accommodate patients who are unable to tolerate an MR environment. Objective: Our objective was to compare task-related full-head fNIRS and fMRI signals across cortical regions. Methods: Eighteen healthy adults completed a same-day fNIRS-fMRI study, in which they performed right-and left-hand finger tapping tasks and a semantic-decision tones-decision task. First-and second level general linear models were applied to both datasets. Results: The finger tapping task showed that significant fNIRS channel activity over the contralateral primary motor cortex corresponded to surface fMRI activity. Similarly, significant fNIRS channel activity over the bilateral temporal lobe corresponded to the same primary auditory regions as surface fMRI during the semantic-decision tones-decision task. Additional channels were significant for this task that did not correspond to surface fMRI activity. Conclusion: Although both imaging modalities showed left-lateralized activation for language processing, the current fNIRS analysis did not show concordant or expected localization at the level necessary for clinical use in individual pediatric epileptic patients. Future work is needed to show whether fNIRS and fMRI are comparable at the source level so that fNIRS can be used in a clinical setting on individual patients. If comparable, such an imaging approach could be applied to children with neurological disorders. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although default mode network connectivity is disrupted in numerous brain pathologies, default mode network deactivation has not been studied in patients with brain tumors. We investigated default mode network deactivation with language task?based fMRI by measuring the anticorrelation of a critical default mode network node, the posterior cingulate cortex, in patients with gliomas and controls; furthermore, we examined default mode network functional connectivity in these patients with task-based and resting-state fMRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 10 healthy controls and 30 patients with gliomas, the posterior cingulate cortex was identified on task-based fMRI and was used as an ROI to create connectivity maps from task-based and resting-state fMRI data. We compared the average correlation in each default mode network region between patients and controls for each correlation map and stratified patients by tumor location, hemisphere, and grade. RESULTS: Patients with gliomas (P = .001) and, in particular, patients with tumors near the posterior default mode network (P < .001) showed less posterior cingulate cortex anticorrelation in task-based fMRI than controls. Patients with both left- and right-hemisphere tumors, as well as those with grade IV tumors, showed significantly lower posterior cingulate cortex anticorrelation than controls (P = .02, .03, and <.001, respectively). Functional connectivity in each default mode network region was not significantly different between task-based and resting-state maps. CONCLUSIONS: Task-based fMRI showed impaired deactivation of the default mode network in patients with gliomas. The functional connectivity of the default mode network in both task-based and resting-state fMRI in patients with gliomas using the posterior cingulate cortex identified in task-based fMRI as an ROI for seed-based correlation analysis has strong overlap.

R-fMRI reconstruction from <i>k</i>-<i>t</i> undersampled data using a subject-invariant dictionary model and VB-EM with nested minorization	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						R-fMRI; Undersample; Reconstruction; Variational Bayesian factorization; Expectation maximization; Nested minorization; Dictionary prior; Robust; Subject-invariant; Sparse; Spatial regularization	LOW-RANK; UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MRI; ACQUISITION; ACCELERATION; RESOLUTION; ALGORITHM; SPARSITY; TIME	Higher spatial resolution in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) can give reliable information about the functional networks in the cerebral cortex. Typical methods can achieve higher spatial or temporal resolution by speeding up scans using either (i) complex pulse-sequence designs or (ii) k-space undersampling coupled with priors on the signal. We propose to undersample the R-fMRI acquisition in k-space and time to speedup scans in order to improve spatial resolution. We propose a novel model-based R-fMRI reconstruction framework using a robust, subject-invariant, spatially regularized dictionary prior on the signal. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference framework based on variational Bayesian expectation maximization with nested minorization (VB-EM-NM). Our inference framework allows us to provide an estimate of uncertainty of the reconstruction, unlike typical reconstruction methods. Empirical evaluation of (i) simulated R-fMRI reconstruction and (ii) functional-network estimates from brain R-fMRI reconstructions demonstrate that our framework improves over the state of the art, and, additionally, enables significantly higher spatial resolution.

Combined Isoflurane-Remifentanil Anaesthesia Permits Resting-State fMRI in Children with Severe Epilepsy and Intellectual Disability	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						fMRI; Anaesthesia; Intellectual disability; Epilepsy; Isoflurane; Remifentanil; Paediatric	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROME; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; SPIKE ACTIVITY; BRAIN; NETWORKS; ARCHITECTURE; SEVOFLURANE	Head motion is a significant barrier to functional MRI (fMRI) in patients who are unable to tolerate awake scanning, including young children or those with cognitive and behavioural impairments. General anaesthesia minimises motion and ensures patient comfort, however the optimal anaesthesia regimen for fMRI in the paediatric setting is unknown. In this study, we tested the feasibility of anaesthetised fMRI in 11 patients (mean age = 9.8 years) with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy associated with intellectual disability. fMRI was acquired during clinically-indicated MRI sessions using a synergistic anaesthesia regimen we typically administer for epilepsy neurosurgery: combined low-dose isoflurane (<= 0.8% end-tidal concentration) with remifentanil (<= 0.1 mcg/kg/min). Using group-level independent component analysis, we assessed the presence of resting-state networks by spatially comparing results in the anaesthetised patients to resting-state network templates from the 'Generation R' study of 536 similarly-aged non-anaesthetised healthy children (Muetzel et al. in Hum Brain Mapp 37(12):4286-4300, 2016). Numerous resting-state networks commonly studied in non-anaesthetised healthy children were readily identifiable in the anaesthetised patients, including the default-mode, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal networks. Independent component time-courses associated with these networks showed spectral characteristics suggestive of a neuronal origin of fMRI signal fluctuations, including high dynamic range and temporal frequency power predominantly below 0.1 Hz. These results demonstrate the technical feasibility of anaesthetised fMRI in children, suggesting that combined isoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia may be an effective strategy to extend the emerging clinical applications of resting-state fMRI (for example, neurosurgical planning) to the variety of patient groups who may otherwise be impractical to scan.

Firstly, due to the lack of sufficient data, deep learning models tend to suffer from overfitting in the training process. Secondly, it is still challenging to model the temporal dynamics from fMRI, due to that the brain state is continuously changing over scan time. In addition, existing methods rarely studied and applied fMRI data augmentation. Approach. In this work, we construct a deep recurrent variational auto-encoder (DRVAE) that combined variational auto-encoder and recurrent neural network, aiming to address all of the above mentioned challenges. The encoder of DRVAE can extract more generalized temporal features from assumed Gaussian distribution of input data, and the decoder of DRVAE can generate new data to increase training samples and thus partially relieve the overfitting issue. The recurrent layers in DRVAE are designed to effectively model the temporal dynamics of functional brain activities. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression is applied on the temporal features and input fMRI data to estimate the corresponding spatial networks. Main results. Extensive experimental results on seven tasks from HCP dataset showed that the DRVAE and LASSO framework can learn meaningful temporal patterns and spatial networks from both real data and generated data. The results on group-wise data and single subject suggest that the brain activities may follow certain distribution. Moreover, we applied DRVAE on four resting state fMRI datasets from ADHD-200 for data augmentation, and the results showed that the classification performances on augmented datasets have been considerably improved. Significance. The proposed method can not only derive meaningful temporal features and spatial networks from fMRI, but also generate high-quality new data for fMRI data augmentation and associated applications.

Recent interest in quantitative fMRI has renewed the importance of oxidative neuroenergetics as reflected by cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) to support brain function. Dynamic CMRO2 mapping by calibrated fMRI require multi-modal measurements of BOLD signal along with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and/or volume (CBV). In human subjects this "calibration" is typically performed using a gas mixture containing small amounts of carbon dioxide and/or oxygen-enriched medical air, which are thought to produce changes in CBF (and CBV) and BOLD signal with minimal or no CMRO2 changes. However non-human studies have demonstrated that the "calibration" can also be achieved without gases, revealing good agreement between CMRO2 changes and underlying neuronal activity (e.g., multi-unit activity and local field potential). Given the simpler set-up of gas-free calibrated fMRI, there is evidence of recent clinical applications for this less intrusive direction. This up-to-date review emphasizes technological advances for such translational gas-free calibrated fMRI experiments, also covering historical progression of the calibrated fMRI field that is impacting neurological and neurodegenerative investigations of the human brain.

Graph neural network (GNN) gains popularity in fMRI representation learning and brain disorder analysis with powerful graph representation capabilities. Training a general GNN often necessitates a large-scale dataset from multiple imaging centers/sites, but centralizing multi-site data generally faces inherent challenges related to data privacy, security, and storage burden. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralized multi-site fMRI data. Unfortunately, previous FL approaches for fMRI analysis often ignore site-specificity, including demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level. To this end, we propose a specificity-aware federated graph learning (SFGL) framework for rs-fMRI analysis and automated brain disorder identification, with a server and multiple clients/sites for federated model aggregation and prediction. At each client, our model consists of a shared and a personalized branch, where parameters of the shared branch are sent to the server while those of the personalized branch remain local. This can facilitate knowledge sharing among sites and also helps preserve site specificity. In the shared branch, we employ a spatio-temporal attention graph isomorphism network to learn dynamic fMRI representations. In the personalized branch, we integrate vectorized demographic information (i.e., age, gender, and education years) and functional connectivity networks to preserve site specific characteristics. Representations generated by the two branches are then fused for classification. Experimental results on two fMRI datasets with a total of 1218 subjects suggest that SFGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

The performance of specific neural coding depends extremely on brain-like models. However, the bio-interpretability of the topology of a brain-like model is still insufficient. The purpose of this paper is to investigate a more biological interpretative brain-like model verified by the performance of specific neural coding. In this study, we used the topology constrained by human brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to construct a new spiking neural network (SNN) as a brain-like model called fMRI-SNN. In the fMRI-SNN, the nodes are Izhikevich neuron models, and the edges are synaptic plasticity models with time-delay. Then, we investigated the specific neural coding of fMRI-SNN, and discussed its mechanism. Our results indicated that: (i) fMRI-SNN has obvious specific neural coding based on time coding for different external stimulations. Furthermore, our discussion on relevance analysis implies that the intrinsic element of specific neural coding is synaptic plasticity. (ii) The specific neural coding of fMRI-SNN outperforms that of scale-free SNN and small-world SNN. Furthermore, our discussion on dynamic topological characteristics implies that the network topology is an element that impacts the performance level of the specific neural coding. (iii) Taking a speech recognition task as a case study, the performance of fMRI-SNN outperforms that of scale-free SNN and small-world SNN in terms of speech recognition accuracy.

Currently, several machine-learning approaches and neuroimaging modalities are utilized for diagnosing AD. Among the available neuroimaging modalities, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is extensively utilized for studying brain activities related to AD. However, analyzing complex brain structures in fMRI is a time-consuming and complex task; so, a novel automated model was proposed in this manuscript for early diagnosis of AD using fMRI images. Initially, the fMRI images are acquired from an online dataset: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Further, the quality of the acquired fMRI images was improved by implementing a normalization technique. Then, the Segmentation by Aggregating Superpixels (SAS) method was implemented for segmenting the brain regions (AD, Normal Controls (NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Significant Memory Concern (SMC)) from the denoised fMRI images. From the segmented brain regions, feature vectors were extracted by employing Gabor and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) techniques. The obtained feature vectors were dimensionally reduced by implementing Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm (HBOA) and fed to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for classifying the fMRI images as AD, NC, MCI, EMCI, LMCI, and SMC. The extensive investigation indicated that the presented model attained 99.44% of classification accuracy, 88.90% of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 90.82% of Jaccard Coefficient (JC), and 88.43% of Hausdorff Distance (HD). The attained results are better compared with the conventional segmentation and classification models.

Traditional analyses are limited to associating activation patterns in particular regions with specific cognitive operation, largely ignoring regional cross-talk or dynamic connectivity, which we propose is crucial for characterization of brain function in the context of task fMRI. We use connectotyping, which efficiently models functional brain connectivity to reveal the progression of temporal brain connectivity patterns in task fMRI. Connectotyping was employed on data from twenty-four participants (12 male, mean age 24.8 years, 2.57 std. dev) who performed a widely spaced event-related fMRI word vs. pseudoword decision task, where stimuli were presented every 20 s. After filtering for movement, we ended up with 15 participants that completed each trial and had enough usable data for our analyses. Connectivity matrices were calculated per participant across time for each stimuli type. A Repeated Measures ANOVA applied on the connectotypes was used to characterize differences across time for words and pseudowords. Our group level analyses found significantly different dynamic connectivity patterns during word vs. pseudoword processing between the Fronto-Parietal and Cingulo-Parietal Systems, areas involved in cognitive task control, memory retrieval, and semantic processing. Our findings support the presence of dynamic changes in functional connectivity during task execution and that such changes can be characterized using connectotyping but not with traditional Pearson's correlations.

J	Golestani, AM; Chen, JJ				Golestani, Ali M.; Chen, J. Jean			Performance of Temporal and Spatial Independent Component Analysis in Identifying and Removing Low-Frequency Physiological and Motion Effects in Resting-State fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; resting-state; temporal ICA; spatial ICA; head motion; physiological noise	END-TIDAL CO2; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GLOBAL NOISE; ICA; NETWORKS; SIGNAL; ROBUST; SEGREGATION; STRATEGIES; ARTIFACTS	Effective separation of signal from noise (including physiological processes and head motion) is one of the chief challenges for improving the sensitivity and specificity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) measurements and has a profound impact when these noise sources vary between populations. Independent component analysis (ICA) is an approach for addressing these challenges. Conventionally, due to the lower amount of temporal than spatial information in rs-fMRI data, spatial ICA (sICA) is the method of choice. However, with recent developments in accelerated fMRI acquisitions, the temporal information is becoming enriched to the point that the temporal ICA (tICA) has become more feasible. This is particularly relevant as physiological processes and motion exhibit very different spatial and temporal characteristics when it comes to rs-fMRI applications, leading us to conduct a comparison of the performance of sICA and tICA in addressing these types of noise. In this study, we embrace the novel practice of using theory (simulations) to guide our interpretation of empirical data. We find empirically that sICA can identify more noise-related signal components than tICA. However, on the merit of functional-connectivity results, we find that while sICA is more adept at reducing whole-brain motion effects, tICA performs better in dealing with physiological effects. These interpretations are corroborated by our simulation results. The overall message of this study is that if ICA denoising is to be used for rs-fMRI, there is merit in considering a hybrid approach in which physiological and motion-related noise are each corrected for using their respective best-suited ICA approach.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is arguably one of the most widely used algorithm for the analysis of brain imaging data, which can be used to extract intrinsic networks of brain from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Witnessed by recent studies, a more flexible model known as restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) can also be used to extract spatial maps and time courses of intrinsic networks from resting state fMRI, moreover, RBM shows superior temporal features than ICA. Here, we seek to employ RBM to improve the performance of classifying individuals. Experiments are performed on healthy controls and subjects at the early stage of AD, i.e., cognitive normal (CN) and early mild cognitive impairment participants (EMCI), and two types of data, i.e., structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and fMRI data. Results: (1) By separately employing ICA for sMRI and fMRI, the features extracted from fMRI improve classification accuracy by 7.5% for CN and EMCI; (2) instead of applying ICA to fMRI, using RBM further improves classification accuracy by 7.75% for CN and EMCI; (3) the lesions at the early stage of AD are more likely to occur in the regions around slices 4, 6, 10, 14, 19, 51 and 59 of the whole brain in the longitudinal direction. Conclusion: By using fMRI instead of sMRI and RBM instead of ICA, we can classify CN and EMCI more efficiently.

Empirical evaluation of human fetal fMRI preprocessing steps	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Fetal fMRI; Preprocessing; Normalization; Denoising; Smoothing; Functional connectivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME-SERIES; IMPACT; MOTION; BOLD	Increased study and methodological innovation have led to growth in the field of fetal brain fMRI. An important gap yet to be addressed is optimization of fetal fMRI preprocessing. Rapid developmental changes, imaged within the maternal compartment using an abdominal coil, introduce novel constraints that challenge established methods used in adult fMRI. This study evaluates the impact of (1) normalization to a group mean-age template versus normalization to an age-matched template; (2) independent components analysis (ICA) denoising at two criterion thresholds; and (3) smoothing using three kernel sizes. Data were collected from 121 fetuses (25-39 weeks, 43.8% female). Results indicate that the mean age template is superior in older fetuses, but less optimal in younger fetuses. ICA denoising at a more stringent threshold is superior to less stringent denoising. A larger smoothing kernel can enhance cross-hemisphere functional connectivity. Overall, this study provides improved understanding of the impact of specific steps on fetal image quality. Findings can be used to inform a common set of best practices for fetal fMRI preprocessing.

Patterns in fMRI data, detected in a data-driven manner, have uncovered recurring configurations that relate to individual and group differences in behavioral, cognitive, and clinical traits. However, resolving the neural and physiological processes that un-derlie such measurements is challenging, particularly without external measurements of brain state. A growing body of work points to underlying changes in vigilance as one driver of time-windowed fMRI connectivity states, calculated on the order of tens of seconds. Here we examine the degree to which the low-dimensional spatial structure of instantaneous fMRI activity is associated with vigilance levels, by testing whether vigilance-state detection can be carried out in an unsupervised manner based on individual BOLD time frames. To investigate this question, we first reduce the spatial dimensionality of fMRI data, and apply Gaussian Mixture Modeling to cluster the resulting low-dimensional data without any a priori vigilance information. Our analysis includes long-duration task and resting-state scans that are conducive to shifts in vigilance. We observe a close align-ment between low-dimensional fMRI states (data-driven clusters) and measurements of vigilance derived from concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and behavior. Whole-brain coactivation analysis revealed cortical anti -correlation patterns that resided primarily during higher behavioral-and EEG-defined levels of vigilance, while cortical activity was more often spatially uniform in states corresponding to lower vigilance. Overall, these find-ings indicate that vigilance states may be detected in the low-dimensional structure of fMRI data, even within individual time frames.

J	Cui, D; Nelissen, K				Cui, Ding; Nelissen, Koen			Examining cross-modal fMRI adaptation for observed and executed actions in the monkey brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Macaque; fMRI; Adaptation; Cross-modal; Action; Motor	MIRROR NEURONS; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; ORGANIZATION; SELECTIVITY; RESPONSES; CONVEXITY; CIRCUIT; MOTOR; F5	While mirror neurons have been found in several monkey brain regions, their existence in the human brain is still largely inferred from indirect non-invasive measurements like functional MRI. It has been proposed that, beyond showing overlapping brain responses during action observation and execution tasks, candidate mirror neuron regions should demonstrate cross-modal action specificity, in line with a defining physiological characteristic of these neurons in the monkey brain. Although cross-modal fMRI adaptation has been put forward as a suited method to test this key feature of cross-modal action specificity in the human brain, so far, the overall usefulness of this technique to demonstrate mirror neuron activity remains unclear. To date, it has never been tested to what extent monkey brain regions known to house mirror neurons, would yield uni- and/or cross-modal fMRI adaptation effects. We therefore performed an fMRI adaptation experiment while male rhesus macaques either performed or observed two different goal-directed hand actions. Executing grasp/lift or touch/press actions in the dark, as well as observing videos of these monkey hand actions, yielded robust responses throughout the brain, including overlapping fMRI responses in parietal and premotor mirror neuron regions. Uni-modal adaptation effects were mostly restricted to the visual modality and the early visual cortices. Both frequentist and Bayesian statistical analyses however suggested no evidence for cross-modal fMRI adaptation effects in monkey parietal and premotor mirror neuron regions. Overall, these findings suggest monkey mirror neuron activity does not readily translate into cross-modal repetition suppression effects that can be detected by fMRI.

Thus, data fusion should employ all dimensions of data to both extract the shared information, and distinguish the dissimilarities of modalities. Method: In this paper, we present a new method based on Advanced Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (ACMTF) method to decompose the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix. We remove the confining assumption of identical shared components in ACMTF and propose an approach to maximize the correlation between the shared components of EEG and fMRI in the common mode, while removing the smearing effect of hemodynamic response function on fMRI data. This method is called Correlated Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (CCMTF). Results: Two simulation scenarios with different noise levels are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed CCMTF method. The simulation results show 30.1% and 23.38% average improvement of Match Scores over ACMTF and N-way Partial Least Square (N-PLS) methods, respectively. The proposed method is also applied to a real dataset of an auditory oddball paradigm. The results of real data analysis show that the proposed CCMTF method estimates the unknown number of shared components between EEG and fMRI data, with p-value less than 0.007. Conclusion and Significance: In addition to the improvement of match score, the simulation results demonstrate that CCMTF has higher performance than ACMTF for fusion of EEG and fMRI datasets in case of extracting the dissimilarities in modalities, and it provides more convenient interpretation of the results, in comparison to N-PLS method.

However, multi-subject fMRI data are noisy and have high spatiotemporal variability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D weighted spatial pooling preprocessing that compresses and smooths multi-subject fMRI data and assigns a higher weight to in-brain voxels but a lower weight to out-brain voxels. This strategy not only largely reduces the size of spatial images but also improves the robustness to noise. Furthermore, to address the high spatiotemporal variability, the rank-(L, L, 1, 1) BTD model of the reduced fMRI data is relaxed by incorporating temporal shift-invariance and spatial orthonormality constraints to extract pooled multi-subject shared spatial maps, shared time courses, subject-specific time delays and intensities. Finally, multi-subject intact shared spatial maps are obtained based on shift-invariant rank-(L, L, 1, 1) BTD of intact fMRI data. The simulated and experimental fMRI data experiments both verify that the proposed method achieves better separation performance and stronger robustness to noise than rank-(L, L, 1, 1) BTD with a spatial orthonormality constraint and a method combining independent component analysis and shift-invariant CPD. Moreover, the proposed method with 3D spatial pooling yields better separation performance than that with 2D spatial pooling, because 3D spatial pooling preserves refined voxels, thereby retaining more information of adjacent slices.

Studies using task-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe neural dysfunction in irritability have increased. However, an integrated review summarizing the published methods and synthesized fMRI results remains lacking.Method: We conducted a systematic search using irritability terms and task functional neuroimaging in key databases in March 2021, and identified 30 studies for our systematic review. Sample characteristics and fMRI methods were summarized. A subset of 28 studies met the criteria for extracting coordinate-based data for quantitative meta-analysis. Ten activation-likelihood estimations were performed to examine neural convergence across ir-ritability measures and fMRI task domains.Results: Systematic review revealed small sample sizes (median = 58, mean age range = 8-16 years) with heterogeneous sample characteristics, ir-ritability measures, tasks, and analytical procedures. Meta-analyses found no evidence for neural activation convergence of irritability across neuro-cognitive functions related to emotional reactivity, cognitive control, and reward processing, or within each domain. Sensitivity analyses partialing out variances driven by heterogeneous tasks, irritability measures, stimulus types, and developmental ages all yielded null findings. Results were compared with a review on irritability-related structural anomalies from 11 studies.Conclusion: The lack of neural convergence suggests a need for common, standardized irritability assessments and more homogeneous fMRI tasks. Thoughtfully designed fMRI studies probing commonly defined neurocognitive functions may be more fruitful to elucidate the neural mechanisms of irritability. Open science practices, data mining in large neuroscience databases, and standardized analytical methods promote meaningful collaboration in irritability research.

A frontotemporal network generated by means of gamma oscillations and comprising the auditory cortex (AC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to be involved in the cognitively demanding auditory information processing. This study aims to reveal patterns of functional and effective connectivity within this network in healthy subjects by means of simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI in 28 healthy subjects during the performance of a cognitively demanding auditory choice reaction task. Connectivity between the ACC and AC was analysed employing EEG and fMRI connectivity measures. We found a significant BOLD signal correlation between the ACC and AC, a significant task-dependant increase of fMRI connectivity (gPPI) and a significant increase in functional coupling in the gamma frequency range between these regions (LPS), which was increased in top-down direction (granger analysis). EEG and fMRI connectivity measures were positively correlated. The results of these study point to a role of a top-down influence of the ACC on the AC executed by means of gamma synchronisation. The replication of fMRI connectivity patterns in simultaneously recorded EEG data and the correlation between connectivity measures from both domains found in our study show, that brain connectivity based on the synchronisation of gamma oscillations is mirrored in fMRI connectivity patterns.

J	Li, Q; Wu, X; Liu, TM				Li, Qing; Wu, Xia; Liu, Tianming			Differentiable neural architecture search for optimal spatial/temporal brain function network decomposition	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Differentiable neural architecture search; Task-based fMRI; Recurrent neural networks; Spatial; temporal	FMRI DATA; SPARSE REPRESENTATION; TASK; CONNECTIVITY; MRI	It has been a key topic to decompose the brain's spatial/temporal function networks from 4D functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. With the advantages of robust and meaningful brain pattern extraction, deep neural networks have been shown to be more powerful and flexible in fMRI data modeling than other traditional methods. However, the challenge of designing neural network architecture for high-dimensional and complex fMRI data has also been realized recently. In this paper, we propose a new spatial/temporal differentiable neural architecture search algorithm (ST-DARTS) for optimal brain network decomposition. The core idea of ST-DARTS is to optimize the inner cell structure of the vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN) in order to effectively decom pose spatial/tem poral brain function networks from fMRI data. Based on the evaluations on all seven fMRI tasks in human connectome project (HCP) dataset, the ST-DARTS model is shown to perform promisingly, both spatially (i.e., it can recognize the most stimuli-correlated spatial brain network activation that is very similar to the benchmark) and temporally (i.e., its temporal activity is highly positively correlated with the task-design). To further improve the efficiency of ST-DARTS model, we introduce a flexible early-stopping mechanism, named as ST DARTS + , which further improves experimental results significantly. To our best knowledge, the proposed ST-DARTS and ST-DARTS + models are among the early effort s in optimally decomposing spatial/temporal brain function networks from fMRI data with neural architecture search strategy and they demonstrate great promise.

J	Nathan, PJ; Bakker, G				Nathan, Pradeep J.; Bakker, Geor			Lessons learned from using fMRI in the early clinical development of a mu-opioid receptor antagonist for disorders of compulsive consumption	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI; Drug development; Target engagement; Efficacy; Biomarker	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; POWER FAILURE; HUMAN BRAIN; OCCUPANCY; TIME; GSK1521498; BEHAVIOR; AMYGDALA; TOOL	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to gain a greater understanding of brain circuitry abnormalities in CNS disorders. fMRI has also been used to examine pharmacological modulation of brain circuity and is increasingly being used in early clinical drug development as functional pharmacodynamic index of target engagement, and to provide early indication of clinical efficacy. In this short review, we summarize data from experimental medicine and early clinical development studies of a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, GSK1521498 developed for disorders of compulsive consumption including binge eating in obesity. We demonstrate how fMRI can be used to answer important questions of early clinical drug development relating to; (1) target engagement, (2) dose response relationships, (3) differential efficacy and (4) prediction of behavioural and clinically relevant outcomes. We also highlight important methodological factors that need to be considered when conducting fMRI studies in drug development given the challenges faced with small sample sizes in Phase 1 and early proof of mechanism studies. While these data highlight the value of fMRI as a biomarker in drug development, its use for making Go/No-go decisions is still faced with challenges given the variability of responses, interpretation of brain activation changes and the limited data linking drug induced changes in brain activity to clinical or behavioural outcome. These challenges need to be addressed to fulfil the promise of fMRI as a tool in clinical drug development.

J	Bai, WJ				Bai, Wenjun			Smoothness Harmonic: A Graph-Based Approach to Reveal Spatiotemporal Patterns of Cortical Dynamics in fMRI Data	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						computational neuroscience; fMRI data; graph analysis; connectome Laplacian analysis; cortical dynamics	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK SCIENCE; BRAIN; THINKING; MIND	Featured Application Benefiting from its convenient derivation without resorting to complex learning algorithms, our smoothness harmonic approach can be deployed in numerous neuroscientific discoveries. This includes differentiating various types of neuropsychiatric disorders by utilizing the extracted smoothness harmonics and exploring the distinctive harmonic features between sleep and awake states of in vivo neuronal recordings. Despite fMRI data being interpreted as time-varying graphs in graph analysis, there has been more emphasis on learning sophisticated node embeddings and complex graph structures rather than providing a macroscopic description of cortical dynamics. In this paper, I introduce the notion of smoothness harmonics to capture the slowly varying cortical dynamics in graph-based fMRI data in the form of spatiotemporal smoothness patterns. These smoothness harmonics are rooted in the eigendecomposition of graph Laplacians, which reveal how low-frequency-dominated fMRI signals propagate across the cortex and through time. We showcase their usage in a real fMRI dataset to differentiate the cortical dynamics of children and adults while also demonstrating their empirical merit over the static functional connectomes in inter-subject and between-group classification analyses.

J	Bergmann, E; Gofman, X; Kavushansky, A; Kahn, I				Bergmann, Eyal; Gofman, Xenia; Kavushansky, Alexandra; Kahn, Itamar			Individual variability in functional connectivity architecture of the mouse brain	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION; FMRI; MOTION; ROBUST; MICE; MRI; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; MODE	In recent years precision fMRI has emerged in human brain research, demonstrating characterization of individual differences in brain organization. However, mechanistic investigations to the sources of individual variability are limited in humans and thus require animal models. Here, we used resting-state fMRI in awake mice to quantify the contribution of individual variation to the functional architecture of the mouse cortex. We found that the mouse connectome is also characterized by stable individual features that support connectivity-based identification. Unlike in humans, we found that individual variation is homogeneously distributed in sensory and association networks. Finally, connectome-based predictive modeling of motor behavior in the rotarod task revealed that individual variation in functional connectivity explained behavioral variability. Collectively, these results establish the feasibility of precision fMRI in mice and lay the foundation for future mechanistic investigations of individual brain organization and pre-clinical studies of brain disorders in the context of personalized medicine. Bergmann et al. employ resting state fMRI to understand how individual variation affects the functional architecture of the mouse cortex. The results of this study lay the foundation for precision fMRI use in mice investigating individual brain organization.

It is a non-invasive research tool that is utilized in neuroscience research and is highly beneficial to the clinical community, especially for the management of neurological diseases, provided that proper equipment and protocols are administered during data acquisition. Although recording EEG-fMRI is apparently straightforward, the correct preparation, especially in placing and securing the electrodes, is not only important for safety but is also critical in ensuring the reliability and analyzability of the EEG data obtained. This is also the most experience-demanding part of the preparation. To address these issues, a straightforward protocol that ensures data quality was developed. This article provides a step-by-step guide for acquiring reliable EEG data during EEG-fMRI using this protocol that utilizes readily available medical products. The presented protocol can be adapted to different applications of EEG-fMRI in research and clinical settings, and may be beneficial to both inexperienced and expert operators.

Alterations in Resting-State Functional Brain Connectivity and Correlations with Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening Measures in Postconcussion Vestibular Dysfunction	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Concussion; vestibular; resting-state fMRI; Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening; traumatic brain injury		BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vestibular symptoms after concussion are common and associated with protracted recovery. The purpose of this study is to define resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) brain connectivity alterations in patients with postconcussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD) and correlations between rs-fMRI connectivity and symptoms provoked during Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening (VOMS) assessment. METHODS: Prospective IRB approved study. Study group: 12 subjects with subacute PCVD (2-10 weeks); control group: 10 age-matched subjects without history of concussion or vestibular impairment. Both groups underwent clinical vestibular assessment. rs-fMRI was acquired on 3.0T Siemens Trio with a 12-channel head coil. rs-fMRI data analysis included independent component analysis-based functional connectivity group differences, graph theory analysis, and ROI-to-ROI connectivity correlation analysis with VOMS clinical derivatives. Group difference maps between resting-state networks were calculated using dual regression method and corrected for multiple comparisons. Correlation analysis between ROI-to-ROI rs-fMRI brain activation and VOMS assessment ratings was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient, with a significance threshold of P <= .05. RESULTS: Compared to controls, PCVD group demonstrated significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity between the default-mode network and right middle frontal gyrus and right postcentral gyrus; and between a vestibular-sensorimotor network and right prefrontal cortex. Significant positive correlations were found between clinical derivative VOMS scores and components of the vestibular, visual networks, and multisensory processing cortical representations. CONCLUSION: Altered rs-fMRI brain connectivity with increased connectivity of visual input, multisensory processing, and spatial memory in PCVD is correlative with clinical derivative VOMS scores, suggesting maladaptive brain plasticity underlying vestibular symptomatology.

However, fMRI has several disadvantages such as high cost and low portability. In addition, fMRI may not be appropriate for people with metal or electronic implants in their bodies, with claustrophobia and who are pregnant. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), a method of neuroimaging using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to reconstruct three-dimensional brain activity images, offers a non-invasive alternative, because fNIRS as well as fMRI measures changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations and, in addition, fNIRS is free of above disadvantages. We recently proposed a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) DOT algorithm and verified its performance in terms of task-related brain responses. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the HB DOT in terms of estimating RSFC. In 20 healthy males (21-38 years old), 10 min of resting-state data was acquired with 3T MRI scanner or high-density NIRS on different days. The NIRS channels consisted of 96 long (29-mm) source-detector (SD) channels and 56 short (13-mm) SD channels, which covered bilateral frontal and parietal areas. There were one and two resting-state runs in the fMRI and fNIRS experiments, respectively. The reconstruction performances of our algorithm and the two currently prevailing algorithms for DOT were evaluated using fMRI signals as a reference. Compared with the currently prevailing algorithms, our HB algorithm showed better performances in both the similarity to fMRI data and inter-run reproducibility, in terms of estimating the RSFC.

Resting-State Brain Activity for Early Prediction Outcome in Postanoxic Patients in a Coma with Indeterminate Clinical Prognosis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT NETWORK; SURVIVORS; CONSCIOUSNESS; MRI; HYPOTHERMIA; GUIDELINES	The authors used resting-state fMRI in a prospective study to compare whole-brain functional connectivity between patients with good and poor outcomes, implementing support vector machine learning. They automatically predicted coma outcome using resting-state fMRI and also compared the prediction based on resting-state fMRI with the outcome prediction based on DWI. Of 17 eligible patients who completed the study procedure (among 351 patients screened), 9 regained consciousness and 8 remained comatose. They found higher functional connectivity in patients recovering consciousness, with greater changes occurring within and between the occipitoparietal and temporofrontal regions. Coma outcome prognostication based on resting-state fMRI machine learning was very accurate, notably for identifying patients with good outcome. They conclude that resting-state fMRI might bridge the gap left in early prognostication of postanoxic patients in a coma by identifying those with both good and poor outcomes. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early outcome prediction of postanoxic patients in a coma after cardiac arrest proves challenging. Current prognostication relies on multimodal testing, using clinical examination, electrophysiologic testing, biomarkers, and structural MR imaging. While this multimodal prognostication is accurate for predicting poor outcome (ie, death), it is not sensitive enough to identify good outcome (ie, consciousness recovery), thus leaving many patients with indeterminate prognosis. We specifically assessed whether resting-state fMRI provides prognostic information, notably in postanoxic patients in a coma with indeterminate prognosis early after cardiac arrest, specifically for good outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used resting-state fMRI in a prospective study to compare whole-brain functional connectivity between patients with good and poor outcomes, implementing support vector machine learning. Then, we automatically predicted coma outcome using resting-state fMRI and also compared the prediction based on resting-state fMRI with the outcome prediction based on DWI. RESULTS: Of 17 eligible patients who completed the study procedure (among 351 patients screened), 9 regained consciousness and 8 remained comatose. We found higher functional connectivity in patients recovering consciousness, with greater changes occurring within and between the occipitoparietal and temporofrontal regions. Coma outcome prognostication based on resting-state fMRI machine learning was very accurate, notably for identifying patients with good outcome (accuracy, 94.4%; area under the receiver operating curve, 0.94). Outcome predictors using resting-state fMRI performed significantly better (P < .05) than DWI (accuracy, 60.0%; area under the receiver operating curve, 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Indeterminate prognosis might lead to major clinical uncertainty and significant variations in life-sustaining treatments. Resting-state fMRI might bridge the gap left in early prognostication of postanoxic patients in a coma by identifying those with both good and poor outcomes.

Hence, we designed this study to explore the effects of VR-based intervention on upper extremity motor function and associated brain activation in stroke patients.Methods/design: In this single-center, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with a blinded assessment of outcomes, a total of 78 stroke patients will be assigned randomly to either the VR group or the control group. All stroke patients who have upper extremity motor deficits will be tested with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and clinical evaluation. Clinical assessment and fMRI will be performed three times on each subject. The primary outcome is the change in performance on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity Scale (FMA-UE). Secondary outcomes are functional independence measure (FIM), Barthel Index (BI), grip strength, and changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect in the ipsilesional and contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) on the left and right hemispheres assessed with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), task-state fMRI (ts-fMRI), and changes in EEG at the baseline and weeks 4 and 8.Discussion: This study aims to provide high-quality evidence for the relationship between upper extremity motor function and brain activation in stroke. In addition, this is the first multimodal neuroimaging study that explores the evidence for neuroplasticity and associated upper motor function recovery after VR in stroke patients.

Resting fMRI-guided TMS results in subcortical and brain network modulation indexed by interleaved TMS/fMRI	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						TMS; fMRI; Neuroimaging; Anxiety; Depression	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CORTEX; TARGETS; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; EMOTION; ANXIETY	Traditional non-invasive imaging methods describe statistical associations of functional co-activation over time. They cannot easily establish hierarchies in communication as done in non-human animals using invasive methods. Here, we interleaved functional MRI (fMRI) recordings with non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to map causal communication between the frontal cortex and subcortical target structures including the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the amygdala. Seed-based correlation maps from each participant's resting fMRI scan determined individual stimulation sites with high temporal correlation to targets for the subsequent TMS/fMRI session(s). The resulting TMS/fMRI images were transformed to quantile responses, so that regions of high-/low-quantile response corresponded to the areas of the brain with the most positive/negative evoked response relative to the global brain response. We then modeled the average quantile response for a given region (e.g., structure or network) to determine whether TMS was effective in the relative engagement of the downstream targets. Both the sgACC and amygdala were differentially influenced by TMS. Furthermore, we found that the sgACC distributed brain network was modulated in response to fMRI-guided TMS. The amygdala, but not its distributed network, also responded to TMS. Our findings suggest that individual targeting and brain response measurements reflect causal circuit mapping to the sgACC and amygdala in humans. These results set the stage to further map circuits in the brain and link circuit pathway integrity to clinical intervention outcomes, especially when the intervention targets specific pathways and networks as is possible with TMS.

A significant problem, when analyzing fMRI time series, is the finding of functional brain networks when the brain is at rest, i.e. no external stimulus is applied to the subject. In this work, we present a probabilistic method to estimate the Resting State Networks (RSNs) using a model-based approach. More specifically, RSNs are assumed to be the result of a clustering procedure. In order to perform the clustering, a mixture of regression models are used. Furthermore, special care has been given in order to incorporate important functionalities, such as spatial and embedded sparsity enforcing properties, through the use of informative priors over the model parameters. Another interesting feature of the proposed scheme is the flexibility to handle all the brain time series at once, allowing more robust solutions. We provide comparative experimental results, using an artificial fMRI dataset and two real resting state fMRI datasets, that empirically illustrate the efficiency of the proposed regression mixture model.

In this work, a field camera is used to assess the benefits of retrospectively correcting B-0 field perturbations on Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) sensitivity in non-Cartesian three-dimensional (3D)-SPARKLING fMRI acquisitions.Methods: fMRI data were acquired at 1 mm(3) and for a 2.4s-TR while concurrently monitoring in real-time field perturbations using a Skope Clip-on field camera in a novel experimental setting involving a shorter TR than the required minimal TR of the field probes. Measurements of the dynamic field deviations were used along with a static Delta B-0 map to retrospectively correct static and dynamic field imperfections, respectively. In order to evaluate the impact of such a correction on fMRI volumes, a comparative study was conducted on healthy volunteers.Results: Correction of B(0 )deviations improved image quality and yielded between 20% and 30% increase in median temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR).Using fMRI data collected during a retinotopic mapping experiment, we demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity to the BOLD contrast and improved accuracy of the BOLD phase maps: 44% (resp., 159%) more activated voxels were retrieved when using a significance control level based on a p-value of 0.001 without correcting for multiple comparisons (resp., 0.05 with a false discovery rate correction).Conclusion: 3D-SPARKLING fMRI hugely benefits from static and dynamic B-0 imperfections correction. However, the proposed experimental protocol is flexible enough to be deployed on a large spectrum of encoding schemes, including arbitrary non-Cartesian readouts.

The aim of this study was to assess visuospatial memory functions and memory-related networks using an adapted version of Roland's Hometown Walking (RHWT) functional MRI (fMRI) task in patients with TLE. Methods We used fMRI to study activation patterns based on a visuospatial memory paradigm in 32 TLE patients (9 right; 23 left) and also within subgroups of lesional and non-lesional TLE. To test for performance, a correlational analysis of fMRI activation patterns and out-of-scanner neuropsychological visuospatial memory testing was performed. Additionally, we assessed memory-related networks using functional connectivity (FC). Results Greater contralateral than ipsilateral mesiotemporal (parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus) activation was observed in left (n = 23)/right (n = 9) TLE. In lesional left TLE (n = 17), significant activations were seen in right more than left mesiotemporal areas (parahippocampal gyrus), while non-lesional left TLE patients (n = 6) showed significant bilateral (left>right) activations in mesiotemporal structures (parahippocampal gyrus). In left TLE, visuospatial cognitive testing correlated with fMRI activations in left (parahippocampal gyrus) and right mesiotemporal structures (hippocampus), characterized by greater fMRI activation being associated with better memory scores. In right TLE, higher scores in visuospatial memory testing were associated with greater fMRI activations in left and right insular regions. FC patterns of memory-related networks differ in right and left TLE. Conclusion While TLE in general leads to asymmetrical mesiotemporal activation, lesion-induced and non-lesional TLE patients reveal different memory fMRI activation patterns. In right TLE, insular regions try to compensate for impaired right mesiotemporal structures during the performance of visuospatial tasks. Underlying functional visuospatial memory networks differ in right and left TLE.

This is particularly important in the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where feed forward systems gather data from imagined brain activity and then send that information to an effector. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a computational approach that enables an accurate mapping of spatial brain activity (fMRI) in relation to the temporal receptors (EEG electrodes) associated with imagined lower limb movement. New method: EEG and fMRI data from 16 healthy, male participants while imagining lower limb movement were used for this purpose. A combined analysis of fMRI data and EEG electrode locations was developed to identify EEG electrodes with a high likelihood of capturing imagined lower limb movement originating from various clusters of brain activity. This novel feature selection tool was used to develop an artificial neural network model to classify right and left lower limb movement. Results: Results showed that left versus right lower limb imagined movement could be classified with 66.5% accuracy using this approach. Comparison with existing methods: Adopting a purely data-driven approach for feature selection to use in the right/left classification task resulted in the same accuracy (66.6%) but with reduced interpretability. Conclusions: The developed fMRI-informed EEG approach could pave the way towards improved brain computer interfaces for lower limb movement while also being applicable to other systems where fMRI could be helpful to inform EEG acquisition and processing.

Identifying neural mechanisms mediating processes of conditional adaptation in humans is an active area of research. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) captures functional connectivity theorized to represent the underlying functional architecture of the brain. This allows for investigating how underlying functional brain connections are related to early experiences during development, as well as current traits and behaviors. This review explores the potential of RS-fMRI of the amygdala (AMY) for advancing research on the neural mechanisms underlying adaptive strategies developed in early adverse environments. RS-fMRI studies of early life stress (ELS) and AMY functional connectivity within the frame of evolutionary theories are reviewed, specifically regarding the development of self-regulatory strategies. The potential of RS-fMRI for investigating the effects of ELS on developmental trajectories of self-regulation is discussed.

However, its circuit level functional anatomy remains poorly understood, partly because in-vivo fMRI cannot directly perturb a brain system and map its casual input-output relationship. Also, routine 3T fMRI has an insufficient spatial resolution. We performed electrical microstimulation (EM) of the striatum in lightly-anesthetized NHPs while simultaneously mapping whole-brain activation, using contrast-enhanced fMRI at ultra-high-field 7T. By stimulating multiple positions along the striatum's main (dorsal-to-ventral) axis, we revealed its complex functional circuit concerning mutually connected subsystems in both cortical and subcortical areas. Indeed, within the striatum, there were distinct brain activation patterns across different stimulation sites. Specifically, dorsal stimulation revealed a medial-to-lateral elongated shape of activation in upper caudate and putamen areas, whereas ventral stimulation evoked areas confined to the medial and lower caudate. Such dorsoventral gradients also appeared in neocortical and thalamic activations, indicating consistent embedding profiles of the striatal system across the whole brain. These findings reflect different forms of within-circuit and inter-regional neuronal connectivity between the dorsal and ventromedial striatum. These patterns both shared and contrasted with previous anatomical tract-tracing and in-vivo resting-state fMRI studies. Our approach of combining microstimulation and whole-brain fMRI mapping in NHPs provides a unique opportunity to integrate our understanding of a targeted brain area's meso-and macro-scale functional systems.

Automatic identification of atypical clinical fMRI results	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Functional MRI; Motor cortex; Language; Brain function; Clinical fMRI	DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; BRAIN-TUMORS; TEST-RETEST; MOTOR; REPRODUCIBILITY; RELIABILITY; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION	Purpose Functional MRI is not routinely used for neurosurgical planning despite potential important advantages, due to difficulty of determining quality. We introduce a novel method for objective evaluation of fMRI scan quality, based on activation maps. A template matching analysis (TMA) is presented and tested on data from two clinical fMRI protocols, performed by healthy controls in seven clinical centers. Preliminary clinical utility is tested with data from low-grade glioma patients. Methods Data were collected from 42 healthy subjects from seven centers, with standardized finger tapping (FT) and verb generation (VG) tasks. Copies of these "typical" data were deliberately analyzed incorrectly to assess feasibility of identifying them as "atypical." Analyses of the VG task administered to 32 tumor patients assessed sensitivity of the TMA method to anatomical abnormalities. Results TMA identified all atypical activity maps for both tasks, at the cost of incorrectly classifying 3.6 (VG)-6.5% (FT) of typical maps as atypical. For patients, the average TMA was significantly higher than atypical healthy scans, despite localized anatomical abnormalities caused by a tumor. Conclusion This study supports feasibility of TMA for objective identification of atypical activation patterns for motor and verb generation fMRI protocols. TMA can facilitate the use and evaluation of clinical fMRI in hospital settings that have limited access to fMRI experts. In a clinical setting, this method could be applied to automatically flag fMRI scans showing atypical activation patterns for further investigation to determine whether atypicality is caused by poor scan data quality or abnormal functional topography.

Language lateralization from task-based and resting state functional MRI in patients with epilepsy	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						epilepsy; fMRI; functional laterality; language; magnetic resonance imaging; resting state; seizures	ATYPICAL LANGUAGE; HUMAN BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; ASYMMETRY; NETWORKS; PREDICTS; OUTCOMES; SURGERY; CORTEX	We compared resting state (RS) functional connectivity and task-based fMRI to lateralize language dominance in 30 epilepsy patients (mean age = 33; SD = 11; 12 female), a measure used for presurgical planning. Language laterality index (LI) was calculated from task fMRI in frontal, temporal, and frontal + temporal regional masks using LI bootstrap method from SPM12. RS language LI was assessed using two novel methods of calculating RS language LI from bilateral Broca's area seed based connectivity maps across regional masks and multiple thresholds (p < .05, p < .01, p < .001, top 10% connections). We compared LI from task and RS fMRI continuous values and dominance classifications. We found significant positive correlations between task LI and RS LI when functional connectivity thresholds were set to the top 10% of connections. Concordance of dominance classifications ranged from 20% to 30% for the intrahemispheric resting state LI method and 50% to 63% for the resting state LI intra- minus interhemispheric difference method. Approximately 40% of patients left dominant on task showed RS bilateral dominance. There was no difference in LI concordance between patients with right-sided and left-sided resections. Early seizure onset (<6 years old) was not associated with atypical language dominance during task-based or RS fMRI. While a relationship between task LI and RS LI exists in patients with epilepsy, language dominance is less lateralized on RS than task fMRI. Concordance of language dominance classifications between task and resting state fMRI depends on brain regions surveyed and RS LI calculation method.

However, having insufficient training data due to the difficulty in collecting fMRI data causes poor generalization capability. Thus, models suffer from the projection domain shift problem when novel target categories are decoded. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot neural decoding approach with semi-supervised multi-view embedding. We introduce the semi-supervised approach that utilizes additional images related to the target categories without fMRI activity patterns. Furthermore, we project fMRI activity patterns into a multi-view embedding space, i.e., visual and semantic feature spaces of viewed images to effectively exploit the complementary information. We define several source and target groups whose image categories are very different and verify the zero-shot neural decoding performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach rectifies the projection domain shift problem and outperforms existing methods.

Unlike correlation, covariance analysis preserves signal amplitude information, which feature of fMRI time series may carry physiological significance. Additionally, we demonstrate that dimensionality reduction of the fMRI data offers several computational advantages including projection onto a space of manageable dimension, enabling linear operations on functional connectivity measures and exclusion of variance unrelated to resting state network structure. We show that group-averaged, dimensionality reduced, covariance and correlation matrices are related, to reasonable approximation, by a single scalar factor. We apply this methodology to the analysis of a large, resting state fMRI data set acquired in a prospective, controlled study of mindfulness training and exercise in older, sedentary participants at risk for developing cognitive decline. Results show marginally significant effects of both mindfulness training and exercise in both covariance and correlation measures of functional connectivity.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used to detect the microstructure of white matter and the function of gray matter, respectively. The damage of these structures will lead to the change of cognitive level in patients with moyamoya disease. In this paper, the principles of DTI and fMRI, their applications and challenges in moyamoya disease are reviewed.

Traces of EEG-fMRI coupling reveals neurovascular dynamics on sleep inertia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; NEURONS; AUTOCORRELATION; TOOLBOX; REGIONS; RHYTHM	Upon emergence from sleep, individuals experience temporary hypo-vigilance and grogginess known as sleep inertia. During the transient period of vigilance recovery from prior nocturnal sleep, the neurovascular coupling (NVC) may not be static and constant as assumed by previous neuroimaging studies. Stemming from this viewpoint of sleep inertia, this study aims to probe the NVC changes as awakening time prolongs using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. The time-lagged coupling between EEG features of vigilance and BOLD-fMRI signals, in selected regions of interest, was calculated with one pre-sleep and three consecutive post-awakening resting-state measures. We found marginal changes in EEG theta/beta ratio and spectral slope across post-awakening sessions, demonstrating alterations of vigilance during sleep inertia. Time-varying EEG-fMRI coupling as awakening prolonged was evidenced by the changing time lags of the peak correlation between EEG alpha-vigilance and fMRI-thalamus, as well as EEG spectral slope and fMRI-anterior cingulate cortex. This study provides the first evidence of potential dynamicity of NVC occurred in sleep inertia and opens new avenues for non-invasive neuroimaging investigations into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying brain state transitions.

Bayesian model selection favors parametric over categorical fMRI subsequent memory models in young and older adults	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						subsequent memory effect; Bayesian model selection; episodic memory; parametric fMRI; aging	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RECOLLECTION; FAMILIARITY; PREDICTS; ATROPHY	Subsequent memory paradigms allow to identify neural correlates of successful encoding by separating brain responses as a function of memory performance during later retrieval. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the paradigm typically elicits activations of medial temporal lobe, prefrontal and parietal cortical structures in young, healthy participants. This categorical approach is, however, limited by insufficient memory performance in older and particularly memory-impaired individuals. A parametric modulation of encoding-related activations with memory confidence could overcome this limitation. Here, we applied cross-validated Bayesian model selection (cvBMS) for first-level fMRI models to a visual subsequent memory paradigm in young (18-35 years) and older (51-80 years) adults. Nested cvBMS revealed that parametric models, especially with non-linear transformations of memory confidence ratings, outperformed categorical models in explaining the fMRI signal variance during encoding. We thereby provide a framework for improving the modeling of encoding-related activations and for applying subsequent memory paradigms to memory-impaired individuals.

Compared with fMRI, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an alternative low-cost, real-time, and non-invasive tool, which can be applied in out-of-hospital settings. To develop and optimize vasoactive stress tests for NIRS, several hypercapnia-induced tasks were tested using concurrent-NIRS/fMRI on healthy subjects. The results indicated that the cerebral and extracerebral reactivity to elevated PaCO(2)depended on the rate of the CO(2)increase. A steep increase resulted in different cerebral and extracerebral reactivities, leading to unpredictable NIRS measurements compared with fMRI. However, a ramped increase, induced by ramped-CO(2)inhalation or breath-holding tasks, induced synchronized cerebral, and extracerebral reactivities, resulting in consistent NIRS and fMRI measurements. These results demonstrate that only tasks that increase PaCO(2)gradually can produce reliable NIRS results.

PD diagnosis heavily depends on clinical features using the patient's symptoms. Therefore, an accurate, robust, and non-invasive bio-marker is of critical clinical importance for PD. This study proposes to develop a new bio-marker for PD diagnosis using resting-state func-tional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI). Unlike most existing rs-fMRI data analytics using correlational anal-ysis, a Topological Machine Learning approach is proposed to construct the bio-marker. The default functional network is identified first using rs-fMRI. Next, rs-fMRI's high dimensional spatial-temporal data structure is mapped on a Riemann Manifold using topological dimensional reduction. Following the topological dimensional reduction, machine learning is used for classification and sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology is applied to three open fMRI databases for demonstration and validation. The PD diagnosis accuracy can reach 96:4% when the proposed methodology is used. Thus, rs-fMRI and topological machine learning provide a quan-tifiable and verifiable bio-marker for future PD early detection and treatment evaluation.(c) 2022 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

FMRI-derived functional connectivity exhibits spatial reconfigurations or time-varying dynamics at infraslow (<0.1Hz) speeds. Conversely, electrophysiological connectivity is based on cross-region coupling of fast oscillations (similar to 1-100Hz). It is unclear whether such fast oscillation-based coupling varies at infraslow speeds, temporally coinciding with infraslow dynamics across the fMRI-based connectome. If so, does the association of fMRI-derived and electrophysiological dynamics spatially vary over the connectome across the functionally distinct electrophysiological oscillation bands? In two concurrent electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI resting-state datasets, oscillation-based coherence in all canonical bands (delta through gamma) indeed reconfigured at infraslow speeds in tandem with fMRI-derived connectivity changes in corresponding region-pairs. Interestingly, irrespective of EEG frequency-band the cross-modal fie of connectivity dynamics comprised a large proportion of connections distributed across the entire connectome. However, there were frequency-specific differences in the relative strength of the cross-modal association. This association was strongest in visual to somatomotor connections for slower EEG-bands, and in connections involving the Default Mode Network for faster EEG-bands. Methodologically, the findings imply that neural connectivity dynamics can be reliably measured by fMRI despite heavy susceptibility to noise, and by EEG despite shortcomings of source reconstruction. Biologically, the findings provide evidence that contrast with known territories of oscillation power, oscillation coupling in all bands slowly reconfigures in a highly distributed manner across the whole-brain connectome.

Previous studies use autoencoder and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve the quality of stimuli image reconstruction from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, these methods mainly focus on acquiring relevant features between two different modalities of data, i.e., stimuli images and fMRI, while ignoring the temporal information of fMRI data, thus leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a temporal information-guided GAN (TIGAN) to reconstruct visual stimuli from human brain activities. Specifically, the proposed method consists of three key components, including: 1) an image encoder for mapping the stimuli images into latent space; 2) a long short-term memory (LSTM) generator for fMRI feature mapping, which is used to capture temporal information in fMRI data; and 3) a discriminator for image reconstruction, which is used to make the reconstructed image more similar to the original image. In addition, to better measure the relationship of two different modalities of data (i.e., fMRI and natural images), we leverage a pairwise ranking loss to rank the stimuli images and fMRI to ensure strongly associated pairs at the top and weakly related ones at the bottom. The experimental results on real-world data sets suggest that the proposed TIGAN achieves better performance in comparison with several state-of-the-art image reconstruction approaches.

Attenuation of motion artifacts in fMRI using discrete reconstruction of irregular fMRI trajectories (DRIFT)	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						EPI; fMRI; image reconstruction; k-space; prospective motion correction; retrospective motion correction	REAL-TIME CORRECTION; BY-SLICE MOTION; HEAD MOTION; DISTORTION CORRECTION; MRI; REGISTRATION; ACQUISITION; TRACKING; COMPENSATION; ROBUST	Purpose: Numerous studies report motion as the most detrimental source of noise and artifacts in fMRI. Current motion correction methods fail to completely address the motion problem. Retrospective techniques such as spatial realignment can correct for between-volume misalignment but fail to address within volume contamination and spin-history artifacts. Prospective motion correction can prevent spin-history artifacts but currently cannot update the gradients fast enough to remove k-space filling artifacts, calling for a hybrid approach to fully address these problems. Theory and methods: Motion can be mathematically formulated into the MR signal equation to describe the motion artifacts at their origin in k-space. From these equations, it is demonstrated that different motions have different effects on the signal. A novel motion correction algorithm is designed from these equations to remove motion-induced artifacts directly in k-space, discrete reconstruction of irregular fMRI trajectory (DRIFT). This method is evaluated rigorously using fMRI simulations and data from a rotating phantom inside the scanner. Results: The results indicate that although some motion types have negligible effects on the MR signal, others produce catastrophic and lasting artifacts even after motion cessation. In simulation, DRIFT is able to remove motion artifacts in the absence of spin history. In a phantom scan, DRIFT significantly attenuates the motion artifacts in the fMRI data. Conclusion: Neither prospective nor retrospective motion correction methods could completely remove the motion artifacts from the fMRI data. However, DRIFT, as a retrospective technique, when combined with prospective motion correction, can eliminate a significant portion of motion artifacts.

Simultaneous BOLD-fMRI and constant infusion FDG-PET data of the resting human brain	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article							GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; BASAL GANGLIA; STATE; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; METABOLISM; CORTEX; SIGNAL; MOTOR	Simultaneous [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FDG-PET/fMRI) provides the capability to image two sources of energetic dynamics in the brain - cerebral glucose uptake and the cerebrovascular haemodynamic response. Resting-state fMRI connectivity has been enormously useful for characterising interactions between distributed brain regions in humans. Metabolic connectivity has recently emerged as a complementary measure to investigate brain network dynamics. Functional PET (fPET) is a new approach for measuring FDG uptake with high temporal resolution and has recently shown promise for assessing the dynamics of neural metabolism. Simultaneous fMRI/fPET is a relatively new hybrid imaging modality, with only a few biomedical imaging research facilities able to acquire FDG PET and BOLD fMRI data simultaneously. We present data for n=27 healthy young adults (18-20yrs) who underwent a 95-min simultaneous fMRI/fPET scan while resting with their eyes open. This dataset provides significant re-use value to understand the neural dynamics of glucose metabolism and the haemodynamic response, the synchrony, and interaction between these measures, and the development of new single- and multi-modality image preparation and analysis procedures.

Prevalent and sex-biased breathing patterns modify functional connectivity MRI in young adults	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CENTRAL SLEEP-APNEA; FMRI GLOBAL SIGNAL; WOMEN; FLUCTUATIONS; RESPIRATION; WAKEFULNESS; AMPLITUDE; ORGANIZATION; POPULATION; GENDER	Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a tool for investigating human brain organization. Here we identify, visually and algorithmically, two prevalent influences on fMRI signals during 440h of resting state scans in 440 healthy young adults, both caused by deviations from normal breathing which we term deep breaths and bursts. The two respiratory patterns have distinct influences on fMRI signals and signal covariance, distinct timescales, distinct cardiovascular correlates, and distinct tendencies to manifest by sex. Deep breaths are not sex-biased. Bursts, which are serial taperings of respiratory depth typically spanning minutes at a time, are more common in males. Bursts share features of chemoreflex-driven clinical breathing patterns that also occur primarily in males, with notable neurological, psychiatric, medical, and lifespan associations. These results identify common breathing patterns in healthy young adults with distinct influences on functional connectivity and an ability to differentially influence resting state fMRI studies. Functional connectivity measured from fMRI data is widely used in neuroscience. Here the authors report an association between two types of breathing signature and obtained BOLD data, and associated sex differences.

The translational gap remains in clinical treatments based on neural substrates of anhedonia. Our pilot study found that depressed individuals depended less on goal-directed (GD) reward learning (RL), with reduced reward prediction error (RPE) BOLD signal. Previous studies have found that anhedonia is related to abnormal activities and/or functional connectivities of the central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN), both of which belong to the goal-directed system. In addition, it was found that real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) could improve the balance between CEN and SN in healthy individuals. Therefore, we speculate that rt-fMRI NF of the CEN and SN associated with the GD system may improve depressive and/or anhedonic symptoms. Therefore, this study (1) will examine individuals with anhedonic depression using GD-RL behavioral task, combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational modeling to explore the role of CEN/SN deficits in anhedonic depression; and (2) will utilize network-based rt-fMRI NF to investigate whether it is feasible to regulate the differential signals of brain CEN/SN of GD system through rt-fMRI NF to alleviate depressive and/or anhedonic symptoms. This study highlights the need to elucidate the intervention effects of rt-fMRI NF and the underlying computational network neural mechanisms.

The localization of the appropriate activity clusters requires sophisticated instrumentation and complex measuring protocol. As the inclusion of the activation pattern in modern self-tailored 3D based radiotherapy has notable advantages, this method is applied frequently. Unfortunately, no standardized method has been published yet for the integration of the fMRI data into the planning process and the detailed description of the individual applications is usually missing. Thirteen patients with brain tumors, receiving fMRI based RT planning were enrolled in this study. The delivered dose maps were exported from the treatment planning system and processed for further statistical analysis. Two parameters were introduced to measure the geometrical distance Hausdorff Distance (HD), and volumetric overlap Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of fMRI corrected and not corrected dose matrices as calculated by 3D planning to characterize similarity and/or dissimilarity of these dose matrices. Statistical analysis of bootstrapped HD and DSC data was performed to determine confidence intervals of these parameters. The calculated confidence intervals for HD and DSC were (5.04, 7.09), (0.79, 0.86), respectively for the 40 Gy and (5.2, 7.85), (0.74, 0.83), respectively for the 60 Gy dose volumes. These data indicate that in the case of HD 5.04 and/or DSC 5.2 and/or DSC 0.79 for 40 Gy and HD 7.85 and/or DSC < 0.74 for 60 Gy the impact of fMRI utilization in RT planning is excessive. The fMRI activation clusters can be used in daily RT planning routine to spare activation clusters as critical areas in the brain and avoid their high dose irradiation. Parameters HD (as distance) and DSC (as overlap) can be used to characterize the difference and similarity between the radiotherapy planning target volumes and indicate whether the fMRI delivered activation patterns and consequent fMRI corrected planning volumes are reliable or not.

Methods A total of 109 patients with brain tumors occupying PRC underwent rs-fMRI and hand movement task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) scans. Using a NN model trained on fMRI data of 47 healthy controls, individual task activation maps were predicted from their rs-fMRI data. NN-predicted maps were compared with task activation and independent component analysis (ICA)-derived maps. Spatial Pearson's correlation coefficients (CC) matrices and Dice coefficients (DC) between task activation and predicted activation using NN (DCNN_Act) and ICA (DCICA_Act) were calculated and compared using non-parametric tests. The effects of tumor types and head motion on predicted maps were demonstrated. Results The CC matrix of NN-predicted maps showed higher diagonal values compared with ICA-derived maps (p < 0.001). DCNN_Act were higher than DCICA_Act (p < 0.001) for patients with or without motor deficits. Lower DCs were found in subjects with head motion greater than one voxel. DCs were higher on the nontumor side than on the tumor side (p < 0.001), especially in the glioma group compared with meningioma and metastatic groups. Conclusions This study indicated that the NN approach could predict individual motor activation using rs-fMRI data and could have promising clinical applications in brain tumor patients with anatomical and functional reorganizations.

Although the international community for human brain mapping has met since 1995, the researchers fascinated by human brain function are still young and innovative. However, the impact of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on prognosis and treatment decisions is restricted, even though standardized methods have been developed. The tradeoff between the groundbreaking studies on brain function and the attempt to provide reliable biomarkers for clinical decisions is large. By describing some historical developments in the field of fMRI, from a personal view, the rise of this method in clinical neuroscience during the last 25 years might be understandable. We aim to provide some background for (a) the historical developments of fMRI, (b) the establishment of two research units for fMRI in the departments of radiology in Germany, and (c) a description of some contributions within the selected fields of systems neuroscience, clinical neurology, and behavioral psychology.

Graph theoretical analysis of visibility graphs can provide new features for data mining applications in fMRI. However, visibility graphs features have not been used widely in the field of neuroscience. This is likely due to a lack of understanding of their robustness in the presence of noise (e.g., motion) and their test-retest reliability. In this study, we investigated visibility graph properties of fMRI data in the human connectome project (N = 1010) and tested their sensitivity to motion and test-retest reliability. We also characterised the strength of connectivity obtained using degree synchrony of visibility graphs. We found that strong correlation (r > 0.5) between visibility graph properties, such as the number of communities and average degrees, and motion in the fMRI data. The test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)) of graph theoretical features was high for the average degrees (0.74, 95% CI = [0.73, 0.75]), and moderate for clustering coefficient (0.43, 95% CI = [0.41, 0.44]) and average path length (0.41, 95% CI = [0.38, 0.44]). Functional connectivity between brain regions was measured by correlating the visibility graph degrees. However, the strength of correlation was found to be moderate to low (r < 0.35). These findings suggest that even small movement in fMRI data can strongly influence robustness and reliability of visibility graph features, thus, requiring robust motion correction strategies prior to data analysis. Further studies are necessary for better understanding of the potential application of visibility graph features in fMRI.

Since the resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can reflect the brain activity state, automatic diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on re-fMRI has become a critical method which can relieve the pressure of doctors meanwhile improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. Up to now, the traditional diagnosis of ADHD based on rs-fMRI converts rs-fMRI into functional connectivity or low-dimensional data for classification which will lead to original information loss since rs-fMRI contains 3D spatial and 1D temporal information. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model consisting of the spatio-temporal feature extraction and classifier. The nested residual convolutional denoising autoencoder (NRCDAE) is exploited to reduce the spatial dimension of rs-fMRI and extract the 3D spatial features. Then, the 3D convolutional gated recurrent unit (GRU) is adopted to extract the spatial and temporal features simultaneously. The spatio-temporal features extracted are sent into the sigmoid classifier for classification. The training and testing are carried out across five sites of ADHD-200 and the results of experimental show that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification performance between ADHD and typically developing (TD) in the cross-site test set from 1.14% to 10.9% compared with other methods. To our knowledge, the 3D convolutional GRU is first employed to extract the features of the fMRI and the model has better generalization than other models.

Modulatory effects of magnetic vestibular stimulation on resting-state networks can be explained by subject-specific orientation of inner-ear anatomy in the MR static magnetic field	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Magnetic vestibular stimulation; MVS; MRI static magnetic field stimulation; MRI B0 magnetic field; fMRI; Resting state; RS-fMRI; Vestibular system; Inner ear; Laterality; Lateralization	HEAD DIRECTION; DISRUPTION; DOMINANCE; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Strong static magnetic fields, as used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stimulate the vestibular inner ear leading to a state of imbalance within the vestibular system that causes nystagmus. This magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS) also modulates fluctuations of resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) networks. MVS can be explained by a Lorentz force model, indicating that MVS is the result of the interaction of the static magnetic field strength and direction (called "B0 magnetic field" in MRI) with the inner ear's continuous endolymphatic ionic current. However, the high variability between subjects receiving MVS (measured as nystagmus slow-phase velocity and RS-fMRI amplitude modulations) despite matching head position, remains to be explained. Furthermore, within the imaging community, an "easy-to-acquire-and-use" proxy accounting for modulatory MVS effects in RS-fMRI fluctuations is needed. The present study uses MRI data of 60 healthy volunteers to examine the relationship between RS-fMRI fluctuations and the individual orientation of inner-ear anatomy within the static magnetic field of the MRI. The individual inner-ear anatomy and orientation were assessed via high-resolution anatomical CISS images and related to fluctuations of RS-fMRI networks previously associated with MVS. More specifically, we used a subject-specific proxy for MVS (pMVS) that corresponds to the orientation of the individual inner-ear anatomy within the static magnetic field direction (also called "z-direction" in MR imaging). We found that pMVS explained a considerable fraction of the total variance in RS-fMRI fluctuations (for instance, from 11% in the right cerebellum up to 36% in the cerebellar vermis). In addition to pMVS, we examined the angle of Reid's plane, as determined from anatomical imaging as an alternative and found that this angle (with the same sinus transformation as for pMVS) explained considerably less variance, e.g., from 2 to 16%. In our opinion, an excess variability due to MVS should generally be addressed in fMRI research analogous to nuisance regression for movement, pulsation, and respiration effects. We suggest using the pMVS parameter to deal with modulations of RS-fMRI fluctuations due to MVS. MVS-induced variance can easily be accounted by using high-resolution anatomical imaging of the inner ear and including the proposed pMVS parameter in fMRI group-level analysis.

Using fMRI to localize target regions for implanted brain-computer interfaces in locked-in syndrome	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Locked-in syndrome; Electrocorticography; fMRI; Implant	HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SIGNALS; ECOG	Objective: Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have the potential to improve quality of life of people with locked-in syndrome (LIS) by restoring their ability to communi-cate independently. Before implantation of such a system, it is important to localize ECoG electrode target regions. Here, we assessed the predictive value of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for the localization of suitable target regions on the sensorimotor cortex for ECoG-based BCI in people with locked-in syndrome.Methods: Three people with locked-in syndrome were implanted with a chronic, fully implantable ECoG-BCI system. We compared pre-surgical fMRI activity with post-implantation ECoG activity from areas known to be active and inactive during attempted hand movement (sensorimotor hand region and dor-solateral prefrontal cortex, respectively).Results: Results showed a spatial match between fMRI activity and changes in ECoG low and high fre-quency band power (10 - 30 and 65 - 95 Hz, respectively) during attempted movement. Also, we found that fMRI can be used to select a sub-set of electrodes that show strong task-related signal changes that are therefore likely to generate adequate BCI control.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that fMRI is a useful non-invasive tool for the pre-surgical workup of BCI implant candidates. Significance: If these results are confirmed in more BCI studies, fMRI might be used for more efficient sur-gical BCI procedures with focused cortical coverage and lower participant burden.(c) 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Specifically, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to anterior cingulate cortex (DLPFC - ACC) functional connectivity, thought to be crucial for effective and efficient attentional control, is reduced in high trait anxious individuals. The current study examined the potential of connectivity-based real-time functional magnetic imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-nf) for enhancing DLPFC - ACC functional connectivity in trait anxious individuals. We specifically tested if changes in DLPFC - ACC connectivity were associated with reduced anxiety levels and improved attentional control. Thirty-two high trait anxious participants were assigned to either an experimental group (EG), undergoing veridical rt-fMRI-nf, or a control group (CG) that received sham (yoked) feedback. RSFC (using resting state fMRI), anxiety levels and Stroop task performance were assessed pre- and post-rt-fMRI-nf training. Post-rt-fMRI-nf training, relative to the CG, the EG showed reduced anxiety levels and increased DLPFC-ACC functional connectivity as well as increased RSFC in the posterior default mode network. Moreover, in the EG, changes in DLPFC - ACC functional connectivity during rt-fMRI-nf training were associated with reduced anxiety levels. However, there were no group differences in Stroop task performance. We conclude that rt-fMRI-nf targeting DLPFC - ACC functional connectivity can alter network connectivity and interactions and is a feasible method for reducing trait anxiety.

The present study aims to investigate whether dexmedetomidine can inhibit motor plasticity in patients with glioma via fMRI. Methods: 21 patients with brain glioma were prospectively recruited between September 2017 and December 2018. Patients were classified into pre-M1 (primary motor cortex) group (n=9), post-M1 group (n=6), and non-eloquent group (control group) (n=6) according to the tumor position related to M1. The hand movement task-fMRI and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) were performed before and after sedation using dexmedetomidine. The lateralization index (LI) of activation voxels and magnitude and the functional connectivity (FC) of motor network were compared before and after sedation and among different groups. Results: Permanent postoperative motor deficit of the upper limb was found in 5 of 6 patients in the pre-M1 group, and none in other groups (P < .01). Task-fMRI showed the LI of activation volume and activation magnitude at M1 significantly increased only in the pre-M1 group after sedation (P < .05). Rs-fMRI showed 60.0% (27 of 45) FCs of motor network decreased in pre-M1 group after sedation (p[FDR] < .05); whereas there was no FC reduction in post-M1 and control groups (p[FDR] > .05). Conclusions: In patients with eloquent area gliomas, dexmedetomidine can inhibit the unstable compensative motor plasticity on both task-and rs-fMRI. fMRI may be a promising method for elucidating the effect of sedative agents on motor plasticity.

To extract more accurate "fingerprint" encoded in FC, we speculated that the indirect effects in FC might be unfavorable information for subject discriminability, then the remaining component of FC (referred as direct FC (dFC)) may constitute a better "fingerprint." Methods: We adopted the silencing method to infer dFC from experimentally accessible FC and explained the superiority of dFC in subject discriminability from the perspective of test-retest reliability. Results: We showed that the subject discriminability of dFC (even with much shorter fMRI data) is significantly greater than that of FC (calculated from the whole available fMRI data) in three public datasets. Furthermore, we elucidated that the silencing method improved subject discriminability by increasing the test-retest reliability of reliable edges (i.e., edges with high intra-class correlation coefficient) and the reliable edges dominated the subject discriminability of functional brain networks. After silencing, the reliable edges were distributed throughout the brain, especially in the Fronto-parietal Task Control, Salience, Ventral Attention, and Dorsal Attention subnetworks. Finally, the subject discriminability of functional brain networks calculated from task-fMRI data outperformed that calculated from resting-state fMRI data, and the silencing method could significantly improve the subject discriminability of each task-fMRI data, respectively. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the dFC estimated by the silencing method from FC might constitute an accurate "fingerprint" for subject discriminability. Significance: This study made a step forward to the personalized neuroscience with fMRI-based brain "fingerprint."

Yet, currently only a few research groups have had the opportunity to run such experiments; furthermore, there is no existing public dataset for scientists to analyse and investigate some of the factors enabling the manipulation of brain dynamics. We release here the data from published DecNef studies, consisting of 5 separate fMRI datasets, each with multiple sessions recorded per participant. For each participant the data consists of a session that was used in the main experiment to train the machine learning decoder, and several (from 3 to 10) closed-loop fMRI neural reinforcement sessions. The large dataset, currently comprising more than 60 participants, will be useful to the fMRI community at large and to researchers trying to understand the mechanisms underlying non-invasive modulation of brain dynamics. Finally, the data collection size will increase over time as data from newly run DecNef studies will be added.

J	Shi, CL; Xin, XW; Zhang, JC				Shi, Chunlei; Xin, Xianwei; Zhang, Jiacai			A novel multigranularity feature-selection method based on neighborhood mutual information and its application in autistic patient identification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Machine learning; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Feature selection; Multigranularity; Autism spectrum disorder	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPECTRUM DISORDER; CLASSIFICATION; PARCELLATION; AMYGDALA; VOLUME	The high dimensionality and small sample of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is the big challenge for machine learning application in identification of mental disorders from fMRI images. Feature selection provides an effective method to select the task related fMRI features and removing the redundant ones. The existing feature-selection methods improved the performance of machine learning model by selecting the discriminative features under the limitation of weak correlation among candidate features. However, the strong correlation among fMRI features and its actual influence on classification performance is less considered. Herein, a novel multigranularity feature-selection method was proposed, which considers both the feature's discrimination and the correlation between features at the same time. Firstly, k-means clustering was used to divide fMRI samples into subgroup reducing the potential heterogeneity within subgroups. Second, a new weight proportional to features' correlation and inversely proportional to the discrimination was used to create minimum spanning trees representing the fMRI feature space. Third, the impact of the correlation among features on the classification was further examined from optimistic and pessimistic perspectives with multigranularity information. The experimental results on fMRI data from ABIDE database show that our method not only reduced the feature redundancy but also is superior to a variety of competing feature-selection methods in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) recognition.

Recently, the relationship between SWEs and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals was assessed in rodent models which revealed cortex-wide BOLD activation. However, it remains unclear which macroscopic signature corresponds to these specific neurophysiological events in the human brain. Therefore, we analyzed simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG)-fMRI data during human non-REM sleep. SWEs individually detected in the EEG data were used as predictors in event-related fMRI analyses to examine the relationship between SWEs and fMRI signals. For all 10 subjects we identified significant changes in BOLD activity associated with SWEs covering substantial parts of the gray matter. As demonstrated in rodents, we observed a direct relation of a neurophysiological event to specific BOLD activation patterns. We found a correlation between the number of SWEs and the spatial extent of these BOLD activation patterns and discovered that the amplitude of the BOLD response strongly depends on the SWE amplitude. As altered SWE propagation has recently been found in neuropsychiatric diseases, it is critical to reveal the brain's physiological slow wave state networks to potentially establish early imaging biomarkers for various diseases long before disease onset.

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies, although currently limited in number, have provided a better understanding of brain changes in people with FRDA. This systematic review aimed to provide a critical overview of the findings and methodologies of all fMRI studies conducted in genetically confirmed FRDA so far, and to offer recommendations for future study designs. About 12 cross-sectional and longitudinal fMRI studies, included 198 FRDA children and young adult patients and, 205 healthy controls (HCs), according to the inclusion criteria. Details regarding GAA triplet expansion and demographic and clinical severity measures were widely reported. fMRI designs included motor and cognitive task paradigms, and resting-state studies, with widespread changes in functionally activated areas and extensive variability in study methodologies. These studies highlight a mixed picture of both hypoactivation and hyperactivation in different cerebral and cerebellar brain regions depending on fMRI design and cohort characteristics. Functional changes often correlate with clinical variables. In aggregate, the findings provide support for cerebro-cerebellar loop damage and the compensatory mechanism hypothesis. Current literature indicates that fMRI is a valuable tool for gaining in vivo insights into FRDA pathology, but addressing that its limitations would be a key to improving the design, interpretation, and generalizability of studies in the future.

We prospectively studied task-relevant fMRI responses in 19 comatose cardiac arrest patients and five healthy controls to assess the fMRI's utility for neuroprognostication. Tasks involved instrumental music listening, forward and backward language listening, and motor imagery. Task-specific reference images were created from group-level fMRI responses from the healthy controls. Dice scores measured the overlap of individual subject-level fMRI responses with the reference images. Task-relevant responsiveness index (Rindex) was calculated as the maximum Dice score across the four tasks. Correlation analyses showed that increased Dice scores were significantly associated with arousal recovery (P < 0.05) and emergence from the minimally conscious state (EMCS) by one year (P < 0.001) for all tasks except motor imagery. Greater Rindex was significantly correlated with improved arousal recovery (P = 0.002) and consciousness (P = 0.001). For patients who survived to discharge (n = 6), the Rindex's sensitivity was 75% for predicting EMCS (n = 4). Task-based fMRI holds promise for detecting covert consciousness in comatose cardiac arrest patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Caution is necessary when interpreting the absence of task-relevant fMRI responses as a surrogate for inevitable poor neurological prognosis.

In this paper, we design single-graphic and matched/unmatched double-graphic visual stimulus experiments and collect 12 subjects' fMRI data to explore the brain's visual perception processes. In the double-graphic stimulus experiment, we focus on the high-level semantic information as "matching", and remove tail-to-tail conjunction by designing a model to screen the matching-related voxels. Then, we perform Bayesian causal learning between fMRI voxels based on the transfer entropy, establish a hierarchical Bayesian causal network (HBcausalNet) of the visual cortex, and use the model for visual stimulus image reconstruction. HBcausalNet achieves an average accuracy of 70.57% and 53.70% in single- and double-graphic stimulus image reconstruction tasks, respectively, higher than HcorrNet and HcasaulNet. The results show that the matching-related voxel screening and causality analysis method in this paper can extract the "matching" information in fMRI, obtain a direct causal relationship between matching information and fMRI, and explore the causal inference process in the brain. It suggests that our model can effectively extract high-level semantic information in brain signals and model effective connections and visual perception processes in the visual cortex of the brain.

Ongoing experiences in the resting state vary in unobserved and uncontrolled ways across time, individuals, and populations. However, the role of self-generated thoughts in resting-state fMRI remains largely unexplored. In this study, we collected real-time self-generated thoughts during "resting-state " fMRI scans via the think-aloud method (i.e., think-aloud fMRI), which required participants to report whatever they were currently thinking. We first investigated brain activation patterns during a think -aloud condition and found that significantly activated brain areas included all brain regions required for speech. We then calculated the relationship between divergence in thought content and brain activation during think -aloud and found that divergence in thought content was associated with many brain regions. Finally, we explored the neural representation of self-generated thoughts by performing representational similarity analysis (RSA) at three neural scales: a voxel-wise whole-brain searchlight level, a region-level whole-brain analysis using the Schaefer 400-parcels, and at the systems level using the Yeo seven-networks. We found that "resting-state " self -generated thoughts were distributed across a wide range of brain regions involving all seven Yeo networks. This study highlights the value of considering ongoing experiences during resting-state fMRI and providing preliminary methodological support for think-aloud fMRI.

Difficulties performing intraoperative mapping have limited its adoption for lesions in/near eloquent regions. In this institutional case series, we demonstrate the utility of fMRI-adjunct planning for LITT near language or motor areas. Six out of 7 patients proceeded with LITT after fMRI-based tractography determined adequate safety margins for ablation. All underwent successful ablation without new or worsening postoperative symptoms requiring adjuvant corticosteroids, including those with preexisting deficits. fMRI is an easily accessible adjunct which may potentially reduce chances of complications in LITT near eloquent structures.

J	Han, YM				Han, Hyemin			A method to adjust a prior distribution in Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis	PEERJ			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; Cauchy distribution; fMRI; Prior distribution; Meta-analysis; Bayes factor	FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; EXTENT	Previous research has shown the potential value of Bayesian methods in fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) analysis. For instance, the results from Bayes factor-applied second-level fMRI analysis showed a higher hit rate compared with frequentist second-level fMRI analysis, suggesting greater sensitivity. Although the method reported more positives as a result of the higher sensitivity, it was able to maintain a reasonable level of selectivity in term of the false positive rate. Moreover, employment of the multiple comparison correction method to update the default prior distribution significantly improved the performance of Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis. However, previous studies have utilized the default prior distribution and did not consider the nature of each individual study. Thus, in the present study, a method to adjust the Cauchy prior distribution based on a priori information, which can be acquired from the results of relevant previous studies, was proposed and tested. A Cauchy prior distribution was adjusted based on the contrast, noise strength, and proportion of true positives that were estimated from a meta-analysis of relevant previous studies. In the present study, both the simulated images and real contrast images from two previous studies were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results showed that the employment of the prior adjustment method resulted in improved performance of Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis.

However, despite decades of research, the exact nature of these differences between typically developing (TD) individuals and those with ASDs remains unclear. ASDs have been widely studied using resting-state neuroimaging methods, including both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, little is known about how fMRI and EEG measures of spontaneous brain activity are related in ASDs. In the present study, two cohorts of children and adolescents underwent resting-state EEG (n = 38 per group) or fMRI (n = 66 ASD, 57 TD), with a subset of individuals in both the EEG and fMRI cohorts (n = 17 per group). In the EEG cohort, parieto-occipital EEG alpha power was found to be reduced in ASDs. In the fMRI cohort, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) power was regionally increased in right temporal regions and there was widespread overconnectivity between the thalamus and cortical regions in the ASD group relative to the TD group. Finally, multimodal analyses indicated that while TD children showed consistently positive relationships between EEG alpha power and regional BOLD power, these associations were weak or negative in ASDs. These findings suggest atypical links between alpha rhythms and regional BOLD activity in ASDs, possibly implicating neural substrates and processes that coordinate thalamocortical regulation of the alpha rhythm.

J	Pelzer, EA; Sharma, A; Florin, E				Pelzer, Esther A.; Sharma, Abhinav; Florin, Esther			Data-driven MEG analysis to extract fMRI resting-state networks	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						Envelope correlation; fMRI; ICA; MEG; phase-amplitude coupling	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; PHASE; GAMMA	The electrophysiological basis of resting-state networks (RSN) is still under debate. In particular, no principled mechanism has been determined that is capable of explaining all RSN equally well. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography are the methods of choice to determine the electrophysiological basis of RSN, no standard analysis pipeline of RSN yet exists. In this article, we compare the two main existing data-driven analysis strategies for extracting RSNs from MEG data and introduce a third approach. The first approach uses phase-amplitude coupling to determine the RSN. The second approach extracts RSN through an independent component analysis of the Hilbert envelope in different frequency bands, while the third new approach uses a singular value decomposition instead. To evaluate these approaches, we compare the MEG-RSN to the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-RSN from the same subjects. Overall, it was possible to extract RSN with MEG using all three techniques, which matched the group-specific fMRI-RSN. Interestingly the new approach based on SVD yielded significantly higher correspondence to five out of seven fMRI-RSN than the two existing approaches. Importantly, with this approach, all networks-except for the visual network-had the highest correspondence to the fMRI networks within one frequency band. Thereby we provide further insights into the electrophysiological underpinnings of the fMRI-RSNs. This knowledge will be important for the analysis of the electrophysiological connectome.

Initially considered a passive relay between the brain and the periphery, the spinal cord is now recognized as being active and plastic. Yet, it remains largely overlooked by the human neuroscience community, in stark contrast with the wealth of research investigating the brain. In this review, we argue that fMRI, traditionally used to image cerebral function, can be extended beyond the brain to help unravel spinal mechanisms involved in human behaviors. To this end, we first outline strategies that have been proposed to tackle the challenges inherent to spinal cord fMRI. Then, we discuss how they have been utilized to provide insights into the functional organization of spinal sensorimotor circuits, highlighting their potential to address fundamental and clinical questions. By summarizing guidelines and applications of spinal cord fMRI, we hope to stimulate and support further research into this promising yet underexplored field.

Therefore, based on fMRI data of ASD cases, this paper reviews the progress of machine learning methods and deep learning methods in ASD classification and recognition in the last three years and summarizes the different research results of fMRI data extracted from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). From the classification performance of classification and recognition of ASD by the two methods, comparing the important classification indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, the current challenges and future development trends are reported, which can provide an essential reference for the early diagnosis of ASD cases.

J	Kashyap, A; Keilholz, S				Kashyap, Amrit; Keilholz, Shella			Brain network constraints and recurrent neural networks reproduce unique trajectories and state transitions seen over the span of minutes in resting-state fMRI	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Networks to dynamics; Brain network models; Neural mass models; Diffusion tensor imaging; Resting-state fMRI; Recurrent neural networks; Generative models	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; DYNAMICS; REGIONS	Large-scale patterns of spontaneous whole-brain activity seen in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are in part believed to arise from neural populations interacting through the structural network (Honey, Kotter, Breakspear, & Sporns, 2007). Generative models that simulate this network activity, called brain network models (BNM), are able to reproduce global averaged properties of empirical rs-fMRI activity such as functional connectivity (FC) but perform poorly in reproducing unique trajectories and state transitions that are observed over the span of minutes in whole-brain data (Cabral, Kringelbach, & Deco, 2017; Kashyap & Keilholz, 2019). The manuscript demonstrates that by using recurrent neural networks, it can fit the BNM in a novel way to the rs-fMRI data and predict large amounts of variance between subsequent measures of rs-fMRI data. Simulated data also contain unique repeating trajectories observed in rs-fMRI, called quasiperiodic patterns (QPP), that span 20 s and complex state transitions observed using k-means analysis on windowed FC matrices (Allen et al., 2012; Majeed et al., 2011). Our approach is able to estimate the manifold of rs-fMRI dynamics by training on generating subsequent time points, and it can simulate complex resting-state trajectories better than the traditional generative approaches. Author SummaryBrain network models have become a promising theoretical framework for simulating signals that are representative of whole-brain activity such as resting-state fMRI. However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity obtained from simulations with empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics to characterize coordination between regions such as functional connectivity. In this manuscript, we extend this work by utilizing modern machine learning techniques to fit the brain network models to observed data and train on the mismatch between the model and observed signal. Our results show that our system training on these new metrics generalizes to a system that is able to reproduce trajectories and complex state transitions seen in rs-fMRI over the span of minutes. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity.

Global waves synchronize the brain's functional systems with fluctuating arousal	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; PUPIL FLUCTUATIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; MOTION ARTIFACT; BLOOD-FLOW; BOLD-FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION	We propose and empirically support a parsimonious account of intrinsic, brain-wide spatiotemporal organization arising from traveling waves linked to arousal. We hypothesize that these waves are the predominant physiological process reflected in spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal fluctuations. The correlation structure ("functional connectivity") of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity. Last, we demonstrate similar, cortex-wide propagation of neural activity measured with electrocorticography in macaques. These findings suggest that traveling waves spatiotemporally pattern brain-wide excitability in relation to arousal.

However, its application to link the network operation with behavior still remains challenging. Here, we combined chemogenetic silencing of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) with tactile fMRI and related behaviors in macaques. Focal chemogenetic silencing of functionally identified SI hand region impaired grasping behavior. The same silencing also attenuated hand stimulation-evoked fMRI signal at both the local silencing site and the anatomically and/or functionally connected downstream grasping network, suggesting altered network operation underlying the induced behavioral impairment. Furthermore, the hand region silencing unexpectedly disinhibited foot representation with accompanying behavioral hypersensitization. These results demonstrate that focal chemogenetic silencing with sensory fMRI in macaques unveils bidirectional network changes to generate multifaceted behavioral impairments, thereby opening a pivotal window toward elucithe causal network brain functions in	[Hirabayashi, Toshiyuki; Nagai, Yuji; Hori, Yukiko; Suhara, Tetsuya; Higuchi, Makoto; Minamimoto, Takafumi] Natl Inst Quantum & Radiol Sci & Technol, Dept Funct Brain Imaging, Inage Ku, Anagawa 4-9-1, Chiba, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan; [Aoki, Ichio] Natl Inst Quantum & Radiol Sci & Technol, Dept Mol Imaging & Theranost, Inage Ku, Anagawa 4-9-1, Chiba, Japan	National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology; Kyoto University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology	Hirabayashi, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Quantum & Radiol Sci & Technol, Dept Funct Brain Imaging, Inage Ku, Anagawa 4-9-1, Chiba, Japan.	hirabayashi.toshiyuki@qst.go.jp	Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015; Minamimoto, Takafumi/AAD-8726-2020; Aoki, Ichio/ABF-7336-2020	Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280; Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Aoki, Ichio/0000-0002-4429-5053	MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [JP15H05917, JP20H05955, JP17H02219]; AMED [17dm0107066h, JP18dm0207003, JP18dm0307021, JP21dm0307007, JP20dm0107146]; cooperative research program at PRI, Kyoto University; National Bio-Resource Project "Japanese Monkeys'' of MEXT, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20H05955, 20H05062] Funding Source: KAKEN	MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); AMED; cooperative research program at PRI, Kyoto University; National Bio-Resource Project "Japanese Monkeys'' of MEXT, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))	We thank J.

Analysis of task-based functional MRI data preprocessed with fMRIPrep	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							BRAIN; WORD; SEGMENTATION; REGISTRATION; ACCURATE; ROBUST	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a standard tool to investigate the neural correlates of cognition. fMRI noninvasively measures brain activity, allowing identification of patterns evoked by tasks performed during scanning. Despite the long history of this technique, the idiosyncrasies of each dataset have led to the use of ad-hoc preprocessing protocols customized for nearly every different study. This approach is time consuming, error prone and unsuitable for combining datasets from many sources. Here we showcase fMRIPrep (), a robust tool to prepare human fMRI data for statistical analysis. This software instrument addresses the reproducibility concerns of the established protocols for fMRI preprocessing. By leveraging the Brain Imaging Data Structure to standardize both the input datasets (MRI data as stored by the scanner) and the outputs (data ready for modeling and analysis), fMRIPrep is capable of preprocessing a diversity of datasets without manual intervention. In support of the growing popularity of fMRIPrep, this protocol describes how to integrate the tool in a task-based fMRI investigation workflow.

Unveiling the potential of machine learning in schizophrenia diagnosis: A meta-analytic study of task-based neuroimaging data	PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review; Early Access						attention; machine learning; meta-analysis; schizophrenia; task-based fMRI	NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; HIGH-RISK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LATENT INHIBITION; BRAIN NETWORKS; PSYCHOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; FMRI; INDIVIDUALS; ABNORMALITIES	The emergence of machine learning (ML) techniques has opened up new avenues for identifying biomarkers associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) using task-related fMRI (t-fMRI) designs. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 31 t-fMRI studies using a bivariate model. Our findings revealed a high overall sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.82 for t-fMRI studies. Notably, neuropsychological domains modulated the classification performance, with selective attention demonstrating a significantly higher specificity than working memory (beta = 0.98, z = 2.11, P = 0.04). Studies involving older, chronic patients with SCZ reported higher sensitivity (P <0.015) and specificity (P <0.001) than those involving younger, first-episode patients or high-risk individuals for psychosis. Additionally, we found that the severity of negative symptoms was positively associated with the specificity of the classification model (beta = 7.19, z = 2.20, P = 0.03). Taken together, these results support the potential of using task-based fMRI data in combination with machine learning techniques to identify biomarkers related to symptom outcomes in SCZ, providing a promising avenue for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Future attempts to deploy ML classification should consider the factors of algorithm choice, data quality and quantity, as well as issues related to generalization.

However, lesion-induced impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) in the lesion border zone may lead to false-negative fMRI results. The purpose of this study was to determine physiological factors impacting the NVC. Twenty patients suffering from brain lesions were preoperatively examined using multimodal neuroimaging including fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG) during language or sensorimotor tasks (depending on lesion location), and a novel physiologic MRI approach for the combined quantification of oxygen metabolism, perfusion state, and microvascular architecture. Congruence of brain activity patterns between fMRI and MEG were found in 13 patients. In contrast, we observed missing fMRI activity in perilesional cortex that demonstrated MEG activity in seven patients, which was interpreted as lesion-induced impairment of NVC. In these brain regions with impaired NVC, physiologic MRI revealed significant brain tissue hypoxia, as well as significantly decreased macro- and microvascular perfusion and microvascular architecture. We demonstrated that perilesional hypoxia with reduced vascular perfusion and architecture is associated with lesion-induced impairment of NVC. Our physiologic MRI approach is a clinically applicable method for preoperative risk assessment for the presence of false-negative fMRI results and may prevent severe postoperative functional deficits.

Nicotine addiction: Translational insights from circuit neuroscience	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Circuit neuroscience; fMRI; Substance use disorder	HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CYP2A6 GENOTYPE; DRUG-ADDICTION; NETWORK HUBS; SMOKING; ASSOCIATION; PSILOCYBIN; SYSTEMS; CORTEX	Contemporary neuroscience aims to understand how neuronal activity produces internal processes and observable behavioral states. This aim crucially depends on systems-level, circuit-based analyses of the working brain, as behavioral states arise from information flow and connectivity within and between discrete and overlapping brain regions, forming circuits and networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), offers a key to advance circuit neuroscience; fMRI measures inter and intra- regional circuits at behaviorally relevant spatial-temporal resolution. Herein, we argue that cross-sectional observations in human populations can be best understood via mechanistic and causal insights derived from brain circuitry obtained from preclinical fMRI models. Using nicotine addiction as an exemplar of a circuit-based substance use disorder, we review fMRI-based observations of a circuit that was first shown to be disrupted among human smokers and was recently replicated in rodent models of nicotine dependence. Next, we discuss circuits that predispose to nicotine dependence severity and their interaction with circuits that change as a result of chronic nicotine administration using a rodent model of dependence. Data from both clinical and preclinical fMRI experiments argue for the utility of fMRI studies in translation and reverse translation of a circuit-based understanding of brain disease states. We conclude by discussing the future of circuit neuroscience and functional neuroimaging as an essential bridge between animal models and human populations to the understanding of brain function in health and disease.

Effective correction requires accurate knowledge of the traversed k-space trajectory. With the goal of making spiral fMRI more accessible, we have evaluated image reconstruction using trajectories predicted by the gradient impulse response function (GIRF), which can be determined in a one-time calibration step. GIRF-predicted reconstruction was tested for high-resolution (0.8 mm) fMRI at 7T. Image quality and functional results of the reconstructions using GIRF-prediction were compared to reconstructions using the nominal trajectory and concurrent field monitoring. The reconstructions using nominal spiral trajectories contain substantial artifacts and the activation maps contain misplaced activation. Image artifacts are substantially reduced when using the GIRF-predicted reconstruction, and the activation maps for the GIRF-predicted and monitored reconstructions largely overlap. The GIRF reconstruction provides a large increase in the spatial specificity of the activation compared to the nominal reconstruction. The GIRF-reconstruction generates image quality and fMRI results similar to using a concurrently monitored trajectory. The presented approach does not prolong or complicate the fMRI acquisition. Using GIRF-predicted trajectories has the potential to enable high-quality spiral fMRI in situations where concurrent trajectory monitoring is not available.	[Graedel, Nadine N.; Vannesjo, S.

Metabolic and Hemodynamic Resting-State Connectivity of the Human Brain: A High-Temporal Resolution Simultaneous BOLD-fMRI and FDG-fPET Multimodality Study	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						BOLD-fMRI; FDG-PET; fPET; functional connectivity; metabolic connectivity; resting-state; simultaneous MR-PET	BASAL GANGLIA; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; ENERGY-METABOLISM; PET; NETWORKS; MODEL; COVARIANCE; SUBJECT	Simultaneous [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography functional magnetic resonance imaging (FDG-PET/fMRI) provides the capacity to image 2 sources of energetic dynamics in the brain-glucose metabolism and the hemodynamic response. fMRI connectivity has been enormously useful for characterizing interactions between distributed brain networks in humans. Metabolic connectivity based on static FDG-PET has been proposed as a biomarker for neurological disease, but FDG-sPET cannot be used to estimate subject-level measures of "connectivity," only across-subject "covariance." Here, we applied high-temporal resolution constant infusion functional positron emission tomography (fPET) to measure subject-level metabolic connectivity simultaneously with fMRI connectivity. fPET metabolic connectivity was characterized by frontoparietal connectivity within and between hemispheres. fPET metabolic connectivity showed moderate similarity with fMRI primarily in superior cortex and frontoparietal regions. Significantly, fPET metabolic connectivity showed little similarity with FDG-sPET metabolic covariance, indicating that metabolic brain connectivity is a nonergodic process whereby individual brain connectivity cannot be inferred from group-level metabolic covariance. Our results highlight the complementary strengths of fPET and fMRI in measuring the intrinsic connectivity of the brain and open up the opportunity for novel fundamental studies of human brain connectivity as well as multimodality biomarkers of neurological diseases.

The reliability and replicability of the fMRI results, however, have been recently questioned, which has been named the replication crisis. Sufficient statistical power is fundamental to alleviate the crisis, by either "going big," leveraging big datasets, or by "going small," densely scanning several participants. Here we reported a "going small" project implemented in our department, the Bergen breakfast scanning club (BBSC) project, in which three participants were intensively scanned across a year. It is expected this kind of new data collection method can provide novel insights into the variability of brain networks, facilitate research designs and inference, and ultimately lead to the improvement of the reliability of the fMRI results.

Research Note Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Activation During Unscripted Discourse in People With Poststroke Aphasia	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; AGREEMENT; DESIGN; OBJECT; FMRI	Purpose: The purpose of this project was to determine the feasibility of employing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task that captured activation associated with overt, unscripted (or free) discourse of people with aphasia (PWA), using a continuous scan paradigm. Method: Seven participants (six females, ages 48-70 years) with chronic poststroke aphasia underwent two fMRI scanning sessions that included a discourse fMRI paradigm that consisted of five 1-min picture description tasks, using personally relevant photographs, interspersed with two 30-s control periods where participants looked at a fixation cross. Audio during the continuous fMRI scan was collected and marked with speaking times and coded for correct information units. Activation maps from the fMRI data were generated for the contrast between speaking and control conditions. In order to show the effects of the multi-echo data analysis, we compared it to a single-echo analysis by using only the middle echo (echo time of 30 ms). Results: Through the implementation of the free discourse fMRI task, we were able to elicit activation that included bilateral regions in the planum polare, central opercular cortex, precentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, Crus I of the cerebellum, as well as bilateral occipital regions Conclusions: We describe a new tool for assessing discourse recovery in PWA. By demonstrating the feasibility of a natural language paradigm in patients with chronic, poststroke aphasia, we open a new area for future research.

Yet, in recent years, the reliability of fMRI effects has come into question and with it, the feasibility of using task-based fMRI to identify developmental changes related to cognition. Here, we investigated the reliability of task-based fMRI activations with a widely used subsequent memory paradigm using two developmental samples: a crosssectional sample (n = 85, age 8-25 years) and a test-retest sample (n = 24, one-month follow up, age 8-20 years). In the large cross-sectional sample, we found good to excellent group-level reliability when assessing activation patterns related to the encoding task and subsequent memory effects. In the test-retest sample, while group-level reliability was excellent, the consistency of activation patterns within individuals was low, particularly for subsequent memory effects. We observed consistent activation patterns in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices, but comparatively lower test-retest reliability in subcortical regions and the hippocampus. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of interpreting task-based fMRI effects and the importance of incorporating reliability analyses in developmental studies. Leveraging larger and densely collected longitudinal data may help contribute to increased reproducibility and the accumulation of knowledge in developmental sciences.

BrainGNN: Interpretable Brain Graph Neural Network for fMRI Analysis	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						GNN; ASD; fMRI; Biomarker	SOCIAL COGNITION	Understanding which brain regions are related to a specific neurological disorder or cognitive stimuli has been an important area of neuroimaging research. We propose BrainGNN, a graph neural network (GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) and discover neurological biomarkers. Considering the special property of brain graphs, we design novel ROI-aware graph convolutional (Ra-GConv) layers that leverage the topological and functional information of fMRI. Motivated by the need for transparency in medical image analysis, our BrainGNN contains ROI-selection pooling layers (R-pool) that highlight salient ROIs (nodes in the graph), so that we can infer which ROIs are important for prediction. Furthermore, we propose regularization terms-unit loss, topK pooling (TPK) loss and group-level consistency (GLC) loss-on pooling results to encourage reasonable ROI-selection and provide flexibility to encourage either fully individual-or patterns that agree with group-level data. We apply the BrainGNN framework on two independent fMRI datasets: an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) fMRI dataset and data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 900 Subject Release. We investigate different choices of the hyper-parameters and show that BrainGNN outperforms the alternative fMRI image analysis methods in terms of four different evaluation metrics. The obtained community clustering and salient ROI detection results show a high correspondence with the previous neuroimagingderived evidence of biomarkers for ASD and specific task states decoded for HCP.

Yet, mapping the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to distinct neuronal processes continues to be challenging. Here, we investigated the characteristics of 7 T-fMRI compared to 3 T-fMRI in the human brain beyond the effect of increased SNR and verified the benefits of 7 T-fMRI in the detection of tiny, highly specific modulations of functional connectivity in the resting state following a motor task. Methods: 18 healthy volunteers underwent two resting state and a stimulus driven measurement using a finger tapping motor task at 3 and 7 T, respectively. The SNR for each field strength was adjusted by targeted voxel size variation to minimize the effect of SNR on the field strength specific outcome. Spatial and temporal characteristics of resting state ICA, network graphs, and motor task related activated areas were compared. Finally, a graph theoretical approach was used to detect resting state modulation subsequent to a simple motor task. Results: Spatial extensions of resting state ICA and motor task related activated areas were consistent between field strengths, but temporal characteristics varied, indicating that 7 T achieved a higher functional specificity of the BOLD response than 3 T-fMRI. Following the motor task, only 7 T-fMRI enabled the detection of highly specific connectivity modulations representing an "offline replay" of previous motor activation. Modulated connections of the motor cortex were directly linked to brain regions associated with memory consolidation. Conclusion: These findings reveal how memory processing is initiated even after simple motor tasks, and that it begins earlier than previously shown. Thus, the superior capability of 7 T-fMRI to detect subtle functional dynamics promises to improve diagnostics and therapeutic assessment of neurological diseases.

This study was aimed at (1) clarifying the cerebral correlates of speaker recognition in humans, in particular the involvement of prefrontal areas, using multi voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) applied to fMRI data from a relatively large group of participants, and (2) at investigating the relationship across participants between fMRI-based classification and the group's variable behavioural performance at the speaker recognition task. A cohort of subjects (N=40, 28 females) selected to present a wide distribution of voice recognition abilities underwent an fMRI speaker identification task during which they were asked to recognize three previously learned speakers with finger button presses. The results showed that speaker identity could be significantly decoded based on fMRI patterns in voice-sensitive regions including bilateral temporal voice areas (TVAs) along the superior temporal sulcus/gyrus but also in bilateral parietal and left inferior frontal regions. Furthermore, fMRI-based classification accuracy showed a significant correlation with individual behavioural performance in left anterior STG/STS and left inferior frontal gyrus. These results highlight the role of both temporal and extra-temporal regions in performing a speaker identity recognition task with motor responses.

This study presents a sparse machine learning solution across whole-brain functional connectivity measures of three datasets, derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and two task fMRI data including a working memory n-back task (nb-fMRI) and an emotion identification task (em-fMRI). The fMRI data are collected from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) for the prediction of brain age in adolescents. Due to extremely large variable-to-instance ratio of PNC data, a high-dimensional matrix with several irrelevant and highly correlated features is generated, and hence a sparse learning approach is necessary to extract effective features from fMRI data. We propose a sparse learner based on the residual errors along the estimation of an inverse problem for extreme learning machine (ELM). Our proposed method is able to overcome the overlearning problem by pruning several redundant features and their corresponding output weights. The proposed multimodal sparse ELM classifier based on residual errors is highly competitive in terms of classification accuracy compared to its counterparts such as conventional ELM, and sparse Bayesian learning ELM.

Towards safe operation of an active retinal prosthesis during functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Retinal prosthesis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Safety; MRI, implants; Functional MRI; Diffusion tensor imaging	STIMULATION; BRAIN	Objective: To determine if the Argus II retinal prosthesis can operate during functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisitions and if currents induced in the prosthesis by imaging are at safe levels. Materials and methods: One Argus II retinal prosthesis was modified to enable current measurements during imaging. Active electronics were modified to enable operation during scans. Induced current was measured during diagnostic scans, which were previously shown to be safe for implanted patients, and during fMRI and DTI scans. All measurements were performed using an ASTM phantom to ensure reproducible placement. Results: The prosthesis was able to maintain communication with the external RF coil during the fMRI and DTI scans except briefly during pre-scans. Current levels induced during fMRI and DTI scans were consistently below those measured during diagnostic scans. Conclusions: fMRI and DTI may be safely performed while the Argus II retinal prosthesis is operating.

However, fMRI may suffer from confounding factors both on the patient side, as well as on the provider side. In this study, we investigate how patient-related confounds affect the ability of the patient to perform language fMRI tasks (feasibility), the task sensitivity from an image contrast point of view, and the anatomical specificity of expressive and receptive language fMRI protocols. 104 patients were referred for language fMRI in the context of presurgical procedures for epilepsy and brain tumor surgery. Four tasks were used: (1) a verbal fluency (VF) task to map vocabulary use, (2) a semantic description (SD) task to map sentence formation/semantic integration skills, (3) a reading comprehension (RC) task and (4) a listening comprehension (LC) task. Feasibility was excellent in the LC task (100%), but in the acceptable to mediocre range for the rest of the tasks (SD: 87.50%, RC: 85.57%, VF: 67.30%). Feasibility was significantly confounded by age (p = 0.020) and education level (p = 0.003) in VF, by education level (p = 0.004) and lesion laterality (p = 0.019) in SD and by age (p = 0.001), lesion laterality (p = 0.007) and lesion severity (p = 0.048) in RC. All tasks were comparable regarding sensitivity in generating statistically significant image contrast (VF: 90.00%, SD: 92.30%, RC: 93.25%, LC: 88.46%). The lobe of the lesion (p = 0.005) and the age (p = 0.009) confounded contrast sensitivity in the VF and SD tasks respectively. Both VF and LC tasks demonstrated unilateral lateralization of posterior language areas; only the LC task showed unilateral lateralization of anterior language areas. Our study highlights the effects of patient-related confounding factors on language fMRI and proposes LC as the most feasible, less confounded, and efficiently lateralizing task in the clinical presurgical context.

Recent work has focused on whole-brain parcellation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data to identify these subunits and create a functional atlas. Functional connectivity approaches to understand the brain at the network level require such an atlas to assess connections between parcels and extract network properties. While no single functional atlas has emerged as the dominant atlas to date, there remains an underlying assumption that such an atlas exists. Using fMRI data from a highly sampled subject as well as two independent replication data sets, we demonstrate that functional parcellations based on fMRI connectivity data reconfigure substantially and in a meaningful manner, according to brain state.

The physiological basis of this signal is neural-vascular coupling, the process by which neurons signal cerebrovasculature to dilate in response to an increase in active neural metabolism due to stimulation. These fMRI studies of aging rely on the hemodynamic equivalence assumption that this process is not disrupted by physiologic deterioration associated with aging. Studies of neural-vascular coupling challenge this assumption and show that neural-vascular coupling is closely related to cognition. In this review, we put forward a theory of processing speed decline in aging and how it is related to age-related neural-vascular coupling changes based on the results of studies elucidating the relationships between cognition, cerebrovascular dynamics, and aging.

Toward Uniform Insurer Coverage for Functional MRI Following Severe Brain Injury	JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION			English	Article						disorders of consciousness; equity; functional MRI; health policy; neuroethics	IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES; CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS; NEURORADIOLOGY; REIMBURSEMENT; ECONOMICS; POLICY; DRUGS; FMRI	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) now promises to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy for patients with disorders of consciousness, and accordingly has been endorsed by professional society guidelines, including those of the American Academy of Neurology, American College of Rehabilitation Medicine, National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, and the European Academy of Neurology. Despite multiple professional society endorsements of fMRI in evaluating patients with disorders of consciousness following severe brain injury, insurers have yet to issue clear guidance regarding coverage of fMRI for this indication. Lack of insurer coverage may be a rate-limiting barrier to accessing this technique, which could uncover essential diagnostic and prognostic information for patients and their families. The emerging clinical and ethical case for harmonized insurer recognition and reimbursement of fMRI for vulnerable persons following severe brain injury with disorders of consciousness is explained and critically evaluated.

Multiple Functional Brain Networks Related to Pain Perception Revealed by fMRI	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Functional MRI; Functional brain networks; Functional connectivity; Pain; Multivariate least-squares regression; Principal component analysis; Hemodynamic responses; Attention	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DEFAULT-MODE; CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; MATRIX; EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT; SENSATION; SYSTEM; NUMBER	The rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to a deeper understanding of cortical processing of pain. Central to these advances has been the identification and analysis of "functional networks", often derived from groups of pre-selected pain regions. In this study our main objective was to identify functional brain networks related to pain perception by examining whole-brain activation, avoiding the need for a priori selection of regions. We applied a data-driven technique-Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)-that identifies networks without assuming their anatomical or temporal properties. Open-source fMRI data collected during a thermal pain task (33 healthy participants) were subjected to fMRI-CPCA for network extraction, and networks were associated with pain perception by modelling subjective pain ratings as a function of network activation intensities. Three functional networks emerged: a sensorimotor response network, a salience-mediated attention network, and the default-mode network. Together, these networks constituted a brain state that explained variability in pain perception, both within and between individuals, demonstrating the potential of data-driven, whole-brain functional network techniques for the analysis of pain imaging data.

Spatiotemporal trajectories in resting-state FMRI revealed by convolutional variational autoencoder	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; Spatiotemporal dynamics; Deep learning; Variational autoencoder; Resting state networks	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS; ORGANIZATION; GRADIENT; CORTEX	Recent resting-state fMRI studies have shown that brain activity exhibits temporal variations in functional connectivity by using various approaches including sliding window correlation, co-activation patterns, independent component analysis, quasi-periodic patterns, and hidden Markov models. These methods often model the brain activity as a discretized hopping among several brain states that are defined by the spatial configurations of network activity. However, the discretized states are merely a simplification of what is likely to be a continuous process, where each network evolves over time following its unique path. To model these characteristic spatiotemporal trajectories, we trained a variational autoencoder using rs-fMRI data and evaluated the spatiotemporal features of the latent variables obtained from the trained networks. Our results suggest that there are a relatively small number of approximately orthogonal whole-brain spatiotemporal patterns that capture the most prominent features of rs-fMRI data, which can serve as the building blocks to construct all possible spatiotemporal dynamics in resting state fMRI. These spatiotemporal patterns provide insight into how activity flows across the brain in concordance with known network structures and functional connectivity gradients.

Concordance between fMRI and Wada test for memory lateralization in temporal lobe epilepsy: A meta -analysis and systematic review	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Functional MRI; Intracarotid amobarbital test; IAT; Global amnesia; Surgery; Surgical outcome	FUNCTIONAL MRI; LANGUAGE LATERALIZATION; LOBECTOMY; ACTIVATION; DECLINE; CORTEX	Objective: The Wada test (WT) is increasingly being replaced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate memory lateralization before temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery. We aimed to determine, via meta-analysis, agreement between the two tests and identify predictors of disagreement. Methods: We performed a systematic search for studies comparing WT and fMRI for memory lateralization with individual-patient data. If results were provided as laterality indexes instead of hemispheric lateralization, the cutoff point for memory lateralization was set to the usual +/- 2 for WT and +/- 0.20 for fMRI. We also evaluated results at our Epilepsy Center. Results: Seven published series plus our own were included, comprising 124 patients. Wada test was performed by recognizing objects in half of the studies, and scenes, drawings, and words in the rest. All used scenes or pictures encoding for fMRI. Wada test-fMRI agreement across the studies ranged from 21.1 to 100%, averaging 46.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.6-56.0%). When cases with bilateral memory in either test were excluded, agreement reached 78.7% (95% CI: 67.6-89.8%), and concordance with contralateral TLE foci 86.4% for the WT and 83.0% for fMRI. Higher agreement was associated with using multiple items during WT (p = 0.001) and higher disagreement with presence of a lesion on MRI (p = 0.024). Binary logistic regression confirmed use of multiple items on WTas the strongest predictor of agreement (odds ratio [OR]: 6.95, 95% CI: 1.84-26.22; p = 0.004) and a bilateral result on theWT or fMRI of disagreement (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.89 and OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.45; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Concordance between WT and fMRI for memory lateralization is low in patients with TLE and bilateral-memorylmemory distribution or a structural etiology, and it improves with encoding of a varied set of items. Both tests can help to lateralize the TLE foci. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Advances in spiral fMRI: A high-resolution study with single-shot acquisition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GRADIENT SYSTEM CHARACTERIZATION; ECHO-PLANAR; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; VISUAL-CORTEX; FIELD FLUCTUATIONS; CORTICAL DEPTH; BOLD SIGNALS; BLOOD-VOLUME; HUMAN BRAIN	Spiral fMRI has been put forward as a viable alternative to rectilinear echo-planar imaging, in particular due to its enhanced average k-space speed and thus high acquisition efficiency. This renders spirals attractive for contemporary fMRI applications that require high spatiotemporal resolution, such as laminar or columnar fMRI. However, in practice, spiral fMRI is typically hampered by its reduced robustness and ensuing blurring artifacts, which arise from imperfections in both static and dynamic magnetic fields. Recently, these limitations have been overcome by the concerted application of an expanded signal model that accounts for such field imperfections, and its inversion by iterative image reconstruction. In the challenging ultra-high field environment of 7 Tesla, where field inhomogeneity effects are aggravated, both multi-shot and single-shot 2D spiral imaging at sub-millimeter resolution was demonstrated with high depiction quality and anatomical congruency. In this work, we further these advances towards a time series application of spiral readouts, namely, single-shot spiral BOLD fMRI at 0.8 mm in-plane resolution. We demonstrate that high-resolution spiral fMRI at 7 T is not only feasible, but delivers both excellent image quality, BOLD sensitivity, and spatial specificity of the activation maps, with little artifactual blurring. Furthermore, we show the versatility of the approach with a combined in/out spiral readout at a more typical resolution (1.5 mm), where the high acquisition efficiency allows to acquire two images per shot for improved sensitivity by echo combination.

Mesencephalic regions not only control autonomic responses but also participate in the modulation of autonomic, emotional, and motivational responses. The specific contribution of the midbrain to emotion regulation in humans remains elusive. Neuroimaging studies grounding on appraisal models of emotion emphasize a major role of prefrontal cortex in modulating emotion-related cortical and subcortical regions but usually neglect the contribution of the midbrain and other brainstem regions. Here, the role of mesolimbic and mesocortical networks in core affect generation and regulation was explored during emotion regulation guided by real-time fMRI feedback of the anterior insula activity. The fMRI and functional connectivity analysis revealed that the upper midbrain significantly contributes to emotion regulation in humans. Moreover, differential functional interactions between the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system and frontoparietal networks mediate up and down emotion regulatory processes. Finally, these findings further indicate the potential of real-time fMRI feedback approach in guiding core affect regulation.

Evaluating the efficacy of multi-echo ICA denoising on model-based fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi -echo fMRI; preprocessing; TE-dependent ICA; MEICA; Retinotopy; Population receptive field mapping	VISUAL-FIELD MAPS; RESTING-STATE; CONFOUND REGRESSION; NOISE CORRECTION; MOTION ARTIFACT; OPTIMIZED EPI; PLACE AREA; CORTEX; BOLD; NETWORK	fMRI is an indispensable tool for neuroscience investigation, but this technique is limited by multiple sources of physiological and measurement noise. These noise sources are particularly problematic for analysis techniques that require high signal-to-noise ratio for stable model fitting, such as voxel-wise modeling. Multi-echo data acquisition in combination with echo-time dependent ICA denoising (ME-ICA) represents one promising strategy to mitigate physiological and hardware-related noise sources as well as motion-related artifacts. However, most studies employing ME-ICA to date are resting-state fMRI studies, and therefore we have a limited understanding of the impact of ME-ICA on complex task or model-based fMRI paradigms. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by comparing data quality and model fitting performance of data acquired during a visual population receptive field (pRF) mapping ( N = 13 participants) experiment after applying one of three preprocessing procedures: ME-ICA, optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising, and typical single echo processing. As expected, multi-echo fMRI improved temporal signal-to-noise compared to single echo fMRI, with ME-ICA amplifying the improvement compared to optimal combination alone. However, unexpectedly, this boost in temporal signal-to-noise did not directly translate to improved model fitting performance: compared to single echo acquisition, model fitting was only improved after ICA-denoising. Specifically, compared to single echo acquisition, ME-ICA resulted in improved variance explained by our pRF model throughout the visual system, including anterior regions of the temporal and parietal lobes where SNR is typically low, while optimal combination without ICA did not. ME-ICA also improved reliability of parameter estimates compared to single echo and optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising. Collectively, these results suggest that ME-ICA is effective for denoising task-based fMRI data for modeling analyzes and maintains the integrity of the original data. Therefore, ME-ICA may be beneficial for complex fMRI experiments, including voxel-wise modeling and naturalistic paradigms.

While these high -resolution data make it possible to address novel questions of directional information flow within and across brain circuits, the corresponding data analyses are challenged by MRI artifacts, including image blurring, image distortions, low SNR, and restricted coverage. These challenges often result in insufficient spatial accuracy of conventional analysis pipelines. Here we introduce a new software suite that is specifically designed for layer-specific functional MRI: LayNii. This toolbox is a collection of command-line executable programs written in C/C ++ and is distributed opensource and as pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS. LayNii is designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage constraints and thus cannot be straightforwardly analyzed in alternative software packages. Some of the most popular programs of LayNii contain 'layerification' and columnarization in the native voxel space of functional data as well as many other layer-fMRI specific analysis tasks: layer-specific smoothing, model-based vein mitigation of GE-BOLD data, quality assessment of artifact dominated sub-millimeter fMRI, as well as analyses of VASO data.

Accurate alignment of 7T fMRI to structural MRI data is critical for precise cortical surface-based analysis. Purpose To quantify the effectiveness of distortion corrections of 7T fMRI data. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Fifteen healthy individuals aged 19-26 years (mean: 21.9 years). Field Strength/Sequence Multiband gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence at 7T; 3D T-1/T-2-weighted sequences (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo [MPRAGE] and sampling perfection with application optimized contrast using different flip angle evolution [SPACE]) at 3T. Assessment fMRI data at 7T were registered to cortical surfaces reconstructed from 3T structural data acquired in the same subjects. Distortions induced by B-0 inhomogeneity and gradient nonlinearity (B-0 and gradient distortions) were evaluated as cortical fallout (misregistration of noncortical areas) and displacement (misregistration along gray matter). Statistical Tests Repeated measures analyses of variance with post-hoc t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Results The accuracy of fully corrected fMRI images based on the intensity distribution was 89.2%. Without any corrections, 9.7% of vertices in the whole surfaces were fallout and the average displacement was 0.96 mm for the rest of the vertices. B-0 and gradient distortion corrections significantly reduced the fallout (to 2.1% and 8.7%) and displacement (to 0.29 mm and 0.86 mm). These corrections were effective even around regions with moderate distortions (the somatosensory and visual cortices for B-0 distortion, and the anterior frontal, inferior temporal, and posterior occipital cortices for gradient distortion). Data Conclusion B-0 distortion correction is crucial for surface-based analysis of fine-resolution fMRI at 7T. Gradient distortion correction should be considered when regions of interest include regions distant from the isocenter of scanners.

Multimodal studies investigating pathophysiology have explored the role of abnormal thalamic reactivity and have provided further evidence supporting the hypothesis of schizophrenia as a disorder of aberrant connectivity and cortical plasticity. Among studies examining treatment, low-frequency rTMS for the management of persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) was the most studied. While multimodal TMS/fMRI studies have provided evidence of involvement of local speech-related and distal networks on stimulation of the left temporoparietal cortex, current evidence does not suggest the superiority of fMRI based neuronavigation over conventional methods or of active rTMS over sham for treatment of AVH. Apart from these, preliminary findings suggest a role of rTMS in treating deficits in neurocognition, social cognition, and self-agency. However, most of these studies have only examined medication-resistant symptoms and have methodological concerns arising from small sample sizes and short treatment protocols. That being said, combining TMS with fMRI appears to be a promising approach toward elucidating the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and could also open up a possibility toward developing personalized treatment for its persistent and debilitating symptoms.

In recent years, the pursuit of the neurobiological mechanisms of ECT action has generated a significant amount of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. Objective: In this systematic review, we integrated all fMRI research in patients with MDD receiving ECT and, importantly, evaluated the level of convergence and replicability across multiple fMRI metrics. Results: While according to most studies changes in patients with MDD after ECT appear to be widely distributed across the brain, our multimetric review revealed specific changes involving functional connectivity increases in the superior and middle frontal gyri as the most replicated and across-modality convergent findings. Although this modulation of prefrontal connectivity was associated to ECT outcome, we also identified fMRI measurements of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex as the fMRI signals most significantly linked to clinical response. Conclusion: We identified specific prefrontal and cingulate territories which activity and connectivity with other brain regions is modulated by ECT, critically accounting for its mechanism of action.

However, this discovery has been primarily based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The role of this whole-brain organization in fast oscillation-based connectivity as measured, for example, by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is only beginning to emerge. Here, we review studies of intrinsic connectivity and its whole-brain organization in EEG, MEG, and intracranial electrophysiology with a particular focus on direct comparisons to connectome studies in fMRI. Synthesizing this literature, we conclude that irrespective of temporal scale over four orders of magnitude, intrinsic neurophysiological connectivity shows spatial similarity to the connectivity organization commonly observed in fMRI. A shared structural connectivity basis and cross-frequency coupling are possible mechanisms contributing to this similarity. Acknowledging that a stable whole-brain organization governs long-range coupling across all timescales of neural processing motivates researchers to take "baseline" intrinsic connectivity into account when investigating brain-behavior associations, and further encourages more widespread exploration of functional connectomics approaches beyond fMRI by using EEG and MEG modalities.

Foot reflexology is a treatment with the hypothesis that such massage stimulation on the feet may cause a therapeutic effect which should be helpful for smoking cessation. However, its mechanism of action in the brain of smoking people remains unknown. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is helpful for real-time brain activity detection. We aim to compare the brain activity effects of foot reflexology with fMRI between smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Materials and Methods. We divided participants into experimental (smokers) and control groups (nonsmokers). Both groups received similar foot reflexology under the fMRI examination. Then, we compared the mean response score in each brain area before and after foot stimulation among groups and between groups. Results. Five nonsmokers and fifteen smokers had completed the study. All participants were right-handed males, with a mean age of 38.6 years. The fMRI brain response in the areas correlated with foot stimulation, including the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe and the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe, was present for all participants. The fMRI response outside the correlated area, including other parts of the frontal and parietal lobes, the temporal and occipital cortices, and the thalamus, was also found in all participants, but was not consistent. Conclusions. The fMRI of the brain is feasible and safe for demonstrating foot reflexology reactions. The response signal outside the correlated motor-sensory cortical area with foot reflexology may have clinical significance and may be helpful for smoking cessation. We suggest conducting a large-scale, randomized controlled trial to confirm these findings.

Nevertheless, the hypothesis that the neuromodulatory adenosinergic system acts as regulator of the individual neuronal activity remains unexplored. MethodsTherefore, fourteen young men underwent Rs-fMRI, A(1)AR PET scans, and neuropsychological tests after 52 h of SD and after 14 h of recovery sleep. ResultsOur findings suggested higher oscillations or regional homogeneity in multiple temporal and visual cortices, whereas decreased oscillations in cerebellum after sleep loss. At the same time, we found that connectivity strengths increased in sensorimotor areas and decreased in subcortical areas and cerebellum. DiscussionMoreover, negative correlations between A(1)AR availability and rs-fMRI metrics of BOLD activity in the left superior/middle temporal gyrus and left postcentral gyrus of the human brain provide new insights into the molecular basis of neuronal responses induced by high homeostatic sleep pressure.

These mainly include reduced oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range in the EEG and altered activations in frontal and striatal regions in fMRI studies. The aim of the present study is to integrate these results using a coupling of simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI. Simultaneous EEG (64-channel) and fMRI (3-Tesla Siemens Prisma) was recorded whilst participants (19 BPD patients and 18 controls) performed a gambling task. Data was analysed for the two imaging techniques separately as well as in a single-trial coupling of both modalities. Evoked theta oscillatory power as a response to loss feedback was reduced in BPD patients. EEG-fMRI coupling revealed an interaction between feedback valence and group in prefrontal regions centering in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), with healthy controls showing stronger modulation by theta responses during loss when compared to gain feedback and the opposite effect in BPD patients. Our results show multiple alterations in the processing of feedback in BPD, which were partly linked to impulsivity. The dlPFC was identified as the seed of theta-associated activation differences.

We designed an emotional auditory paradigm to explore brain activation during emotional and nonemotional word processing. This study aimed to analyze if longitudinal changes in brain fMRI BOLD activation is present in patients vs. healthy controls. A group of FEP patients (n = 34) received clinical assessment and had a fMRI scan at baseline and follow-up (average, 25-month interval). During the fMRI scan, both emotional and nonemotional words were presented as a block design. Results were compared with a pair of healthy control group (n = 13). Patients showed a decreased activation at follow-up fMRI in amygdala (F = 4.69; p = 0.04) and hippocampus (F = 5.03; p = 0.03) compared with controls. Middle frontal gyrus was the only area that showed a substantial increased activation in patients (F = 4.53; p = 0.04). A great heterogeneity in individual activation patterns was also found. These results support the relevance of the type of paradigm in neuroimaging for psychosis. This is, as far as we know, the first longitudinal study with an emotional auditory paradigm in FEP. Our results suggested that the amygdala and hippocampus play a key role in psychotic disease. More studies are needed to understand the heterogeneity of response at individual level.

A precision neuroscience approach to estimating reliability of neural responses during emotion processing: Implications for task-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Reliability; Neuroimaging; Longitudinal; Individual differences; Translational neuroscience; Clinical neuroscience	STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; AMYGDALA REACTIVITY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MULTILEVEL MODELS; NEUTRAL FACES; FEARFUL FACES; R PACKAGE; BRAIN	Recent work demonstrating low test -retest reliability of neural activation during fMRI tasks raises questions about the utility of task -based fMRI for the study of individual variation in brain function. Two possible sources of the instability in task -based BOLD signal over time are noise or measurement error in the instrument, and meaningful variation across time within -individuals in the construct itself-brain activation elicited during fMRI tasks. Examining the contribution of these two sources of test -retest unreliability in task -evoked brain activity has far-reaching implications for cognitive neuroscience. If test -retest reliability largely reflects measurement error, it suggests that task -based fMRI has little utility in the study of either inter- or intra-individual differences. On the other hand, if task -evoked BOLD signal varies meaningfully over time, it would suggest that this tool may yet be well suited to studying intraindividual variation. We parse these sources of variance in BOLD signal in response to emotional cues over time and within -individuals in a longitudinal sample with 10 monthly fMRI scans. Testretest reliability was low, reflecting a lack of stability in between -person differences across scans. In contrast, within -person, within -session internal consistency of the BOLD signal was higher, and within -person fluctuations across sessions explained almost half the variance in voxel-level neural responses. Additionally, monthly fluctuations in neural response to emotional cues were associated with intraindividual variation in mood, sleep, and exposure to stressors. Rather than reflecting trait -like differences across people, neural responses to emotional cues may be more reflective of intraindividual variation over time. These patterns suggest that task -based fMRI may be able to contribute to the study of individual variation in brain function if more attention is given to within -individual variation approaches, psychometrics-beginning with improving reliability beyond the modest estimates observed here, and the validity of task fMRI beyond the suggestive associations reported here.

Mifepristone enhances the neural efficiency of human visuospatial memory encoding and recall	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; Glucocorticoid receptor; HPA axis; Mifepristone; Working memory; Visuospatial learning	SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTORS; PROGESTERONE; DISORDERS; IMPAIRS; BRAIN; COGNITION; HORMONES; THERAPY; RU-486	Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism is a promising new treatment for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders but the effects of GR antagonism on cognition related brain activity is poorly understood. This study examines the effects of the GR and progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone on the neural correlates of visuospatial learning and working memory in healthy male participants. The study used a pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design to determine mifepristone effects on visuospatial paired associates learning (vPAL) and n-back working memory (WM) fMRI task related brain activations. 20 right-handed healthy male participants received 600 mg mifepristone or placebo on two separate imaging days and each participant performed fMRI tasks four hours later. The effect of mifepristone on task related brain activations was determined using Region of Interest (ROI) fMRI analyses and an exploratory whole brain voxel-wise fMRI task analyses was also conducted. The vPAL task ROI analysis found that mifepristone administration was significantly associated with decreased fusiform cortex activations in first and second encoding blocks (p = 0.007, p = 0.04) and decreased angular and precuneal cortices activations in the first recall block (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in fMRI brain activations associated with mifepristone administration in the n-back task ROI' s (all p > 0.05). Mifepristone administration did not significantly affect fMRI brain activations in the whole brain voxel-wise analyses for both tasks. N-back and vPAL task reaction times and accuracy were similar in both mifepristone and placebo conditions (all p > 0.05). Our finding of decreased fusiform, angular and precuneal vPAL task related brain activity associated with mifepristone administration for the same behavioural performance as found in the placebo condition may represent improved efficiency of visuospatial memory encoding and recall. These findings provide evidence that mifepristone may enhance the efficiency of human visuospatial memory and calls for further studies in patient populations using an fMRI approach to provide proof of concept for new treatments.

Due to a mouse's small size, spontaneous breathing has often been used. Because the vascular physiology affecting fMRI might not be controlled normally, its effects on functional responses were investigated with optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging and 9.4 T BOLD fMRI. Three conditions were tested in C57BL/6 mice: spontaneous breathing under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia (KX), mechanical ventilation under KX, and mechanical ventilation under isoflurane. Spontaneous breathing under KX induced an average pCO(2) of 83 mmHg, whereas a mechanical ventilation condition achieved a pCO(2) of 37-41 mmHg within a physiological range. The baseline diameter of arterial and venous vessels was only 7%-9% larger with spontaneous breathing than with mechanical ventilation under KX, but it was much smaller than that in normocapnic isoflurane-anesthetized mice. Three major functional studies were performed. First, CBV-weighted OIS and arterial dilations to 4-second forepaw stimulation were rapid and larger at normocapnia than hypercapnia under KX, but very small under isoflurane. Second, CBV-weighted OIS and arterial dilations by vasodilator acetazolamide were measured for investigating vascular reactivity and were larger in the normocapnic condition than in the hypercapnic condition under KX. Third, evoked OIS and BOLD fMRI responses in the contralateral mouse somatosensory cortex to 20-second forepaw stimulation were faster and larger in the mechanical ventilation than spontaneous breathing. BOLD fMRI peaked at the end of the 20-second stimulation under hypercapnic spontaneous breathing, and at 9 seconds under mechanical ventilation. The peak amplitude of BOLD fMRI was 2.2% at hypercapnia and 3.4% at normocapnia. Overall, spontaneous breathing induces sluggish reduced hemodynamic and fMRI responses, but it is still viable for KX anesthesia due to its simplicity, noninvasiveness, and well-localized BOLD activity in the somatosensory cortex.

First, a single-subject spike-related analysis was performed: (a) to verify the BOLD concordance with the presumed Epileptogenic Zone (EZ); and (b) to investigate the Intrinsic Connectivity Networks (ICN) involvement. Then, a group analysis was performed to search for common BOLD changes in TLE.Results: Interictal epileptiform discharges were recorded in 25 patients and in 19 (58%), a BOLD response was obtained at the single-subject level. In 42% of the cases, BOLD changes were observed in the temporal lobe, although only one patient had a pure concordant finding, with a single fMRI cluster overlapping (and limited to) the EZ identified by anatomo-electro-clinical correlations. In the remaining 58% of the cases, BOLD responses were localized outside the temporal lobe and the presumed EZ. In every patient, with a spike-related fMRI map, at least one ICN appeared to be involved. Four main ICNs were preferentially involved, namely, motor, visual, auditory/motor speech, and the default mode network. At the single-subject level, EEG-fMRI proved to have high specificity (above 65%) in detecting engagement of an ICN and the corresponding ictal/postictal symptom, and good positive predictive value (above 67%) in all networks except the visual one. Finally, in the group analysis of BOLD changes related to IED revealed common activations at the right precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, and middle cingulate gyrus.Significance: Interictal temporal spikes affect several distant extra-temporal areas, and specifically the motor/premotor cortex. EEG-fMRI in patients with TLE eligible for surgery is recommended not for strictly localizing purposes rather it might be useful to investigate ICNs alterations at the single-subject level.

For some patients and in some situations, AVH cannot be relieved by standard therapeutic approaches. More advanced treatments are needed, among which neurofeedback, and more specifically fMRI-based neurofeedback, has been considered. This paper discusses the different possibilities to approach neurofeedback in the specific context of phasic symptoms, by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the available neurofeedback options. It concludes with the added value of the recently introduced information-based neurofeedback. Although requiring an online fMRI signal classifier, which can be quite complex to implement, this neurofeedback strategy opens a door toward an alternative treatment option for complex phasic symptomatology.

Most current rs-fMRI analyses use linear correlation. Since correlation is a bivariate measure of association, it discards most of the information contained in the spatial variation of the thousands of hemodynamic signals within the voxels in a given brain region. Subject-specific functional RSNs using typical rs-fMRI data, are therefore dominated by indirect connections and loss of spatial information and can only deliver reliable connectivity after group averaging. While bivariate partial correlation can rule out indirect connections, it results in connectivity that is too sparse due to lack of sensitivity. We have developed a method that uses all the spatial variation information in a given parcel by employing a multivariate information-theoretic association measure based on canonical correlations. Our method, multivariate conditional mutual information (mvCMI) reliably constructs single-subject connectivity estimates showing mostly direct connections. Averaging across subjects is not needed. The method is applied to Human Connectome Project data and compared to diffusion MRI. The results are far superior to those obtained by correlation and partial correlation.

Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to evaluate abnormal brain connectivity patterns at rest and brain activation patterns during specific tasks in patients with PD-FOG. This review has examined the existing functional neuroimaging literature in PD-FOG, including those with treatment. Summarizing these articles provides an opportunity for a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology in PD-FOG. Methods According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we performed a literature review of studies using fMRI to investigate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PD-FOG. Results We initially identified 201 documents. After excluding the duplicates, reviews, and other irrelevant articles, 39 articles were finally identified, including 18 task-based fMRI studies and 21 resting-state fMRI studies. Conclusions Studies using fMRI techniques to evaluate PD-FOG have found dysfunctional connectivity in widespread cortical and subcortical regions. Standardized imaging protocols and detailed subtypes of PD-FOG are furthered required to elucidate current findings.

A collection of associated methods aims to replicate observations made in humans and to identify the mechanisms underlying the distributed neuronal activity in the healthy and disordered brain. Animal fMRI studies have developed rapidly over the past years, fueled by the development of resting-state fMRI connectivity and genetically encoded neuromodulatory tools. Yet, comparisons between sites remain hampered by lack of standardization. Recently, we highlighted that mouse resting-state functional connectivity converges across centers, although large discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity remained. Here, we explore past and present trends within the animal fMRI community and highlight critical aspects in study design, data acquisition, and post-processing operations, that may affect the results and influence the comparability between studies. We also suggest practices aimed to promote the adoption of standards within the community and improve between-lab reproducibility. The implementation of standardized animal neuroimaging protocols will facilitate animal population imaging efforts as well as meta-analysis and replication studies, the gold standards in evidence-based science.

A Machine Learning Approach to the Differentiation of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) From a Sedentary Control	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS); logistic regression; machine learning; recursive feature elimination (RFE)	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; BRAIN; FMRI; MULTICOLLINEARITY; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; SEVERITY	Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition estimated to impact at least 1 million individuals in the United States, however there persists controversy about its existence. Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified 29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.

Measuring brain beats: Cardiac-aligned fast functional magnetic resonance imaging signals	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cardiac; CSF; fMRI; SMS; vasculature	HEART-RATE; PHASE; FMRI; FLOW; FLUCTUATIONS; ELASTOGRAPHY; VELOCITY; MRI; ARTERIES	Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulse and flow throughout the brain, driven by the cardiac cycle. These fluid dynamics, which are essential to healthy brain function, are characterized by several noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Recent developments in fast MRI, specifically simultaneous multislice acquisition methods, provide a new opportunity to rapidly and broadly assess cardiac-driven flow, including CSF spaces, surface vessels and parenchymal vessels. We use these techniques to assess blood and CSF flow dynamics in brief (3.5 min) scans on a conventional 3 T MRI scanner in five subjects. Cardiac pulses are measured with a photoplethysmography (PPG) on the index finger, along with functional MRI (fMRI) signals in the brain. We, retrospectively, align the fMRI signals to the heartbeat. Highly reliable cardiac-gated fMRI temporal signals are observed in CSF and blood on the timescale of one heartbeat (test-retest reliability within subjects R-2 > 50%). In blood vessels, a local minimum is observed following systole. In CSF spaces, the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces have a local maximum following systole instead. Slower resting-state scans with slice timing, retrospectively, aligned to the cardiac pulse, reveal similar cardiac-gated responses. The cardiac-gated measurements estimate the amplitude and phase of fMRI pulsations in the CSF relative to those in the arteries, an estimate of the local intracranial impedance. Cardiac aligned fMRI signals can provide new insights about fluid dynamics or diagnostics for diseases where these dynamics are important.

Fetal brain activation and connectivity maps can be heavily influenced by 1) fetal-specific motion effects on the time-series and 2) the accuracy of time-series spatial normalization to a standardized gestational-week (GW) specific fetal template space. Due to the absence of a standardized and generalizable image processing protocol, the objective of the present work was to implement a validated fetal rs-fMRI preprocessing pipeline (RS-FetMRI) divided into 6 inter-dependent preprocessing modules (i.e., M1 to M6) and designed to work entirely as an extension for Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). RS-FetMRI pipeline output analyses on rs-fMRI time-series sampled from a cohort of fetuses acquired on both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanning systems showed increased efficacy of estimation of the degree of movement coupled with an efficient motion censoring procedure, resulting in increased number of motion-uncorrupted volumes and temporal continuity in fetal rs-fMRI time-series data. Moreover, a "structural-free" SPM-based spatial normalization procedure granted a high degree of spatial overlap with high reproducibility and a significant improvement in whole-brain and parcellation-specific Temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (TSNR) mirrored by functional connectivity analysis. To our knowledge, the RS-FetMRI pipeline is the first semi-automatic and easy-to-use standardized fetal rs-fMRI preprocessing pipeline completely integrated in MATLAB-SPM able to remove entry barriers for new research groups into the field of fetal rs-fMRI, for both research or clinical purposes, and ultimately to make future fetal brain connectivity investigations more suitable for comparison and cross-validation.

Although previous studies have achieved promising performances based on either shallow or deep learning models, there is still much space to improve the accuracy of spatio-temporal pattern characterization of FBNs by optimally integrating the four-dimensional (4D) features of fMRI. In this study, we introduce a novel Spatio-Temporal Attention 4D Convolutional Neural Network (STA-4DCNN) model to characterize individualized spatio-temporal patterns of FBNs. Particularly, STA-4DCNN is composed of two subnetworks, in which the first Spatial Attention 4D CNN (SA-4DCNN) models the spatio-temporal features of 4D fMRI data and then characterizes the spatial pattern of FBNs, and the second Temporal Guided Attention Network (T-GANet) further characterizes the temporal pattern of FBNs under the guidance of the spatial pattern together with 4D fMRI data. We evaluate the proposed STA-4DCNN on seven different task fMRI and one resting state fMRI datasets from the publicly released Human Connectome Project. The experimental results demonstrate that STA-4DCNN has superior ability and generalizability in characterizing individualized spatio-temporal patterns of FBNs when compared to other state-of-the-art models. We further apply STA-4DCNN on another independent ABIDE I resting state fMRI dataset including both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical developing (TD) subjects, and successfully identify abnormal spatio-temporal patterns of FBNs in ASD compared to TD. In general, STA-4DCNN provides a powerful tool for FBN characterization and for clinical applications on brain disease characterization at the individual level.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have focused on the temporally evolving characteristics of RSNs, but it is unclear what temporal characteristics are reflected in the networks. To address this issue, we devised a novel method for voxel-based visualization of spatiotemporal characteristics of rs-fMRI with a time scale of tens of seconds. We first extracted clusters of dominant activity-patterns using a region-of-interest approach and then used these temporal patterns of the clusters to obtain voxel-based activation patterns related to the clusters. We found that activation patterns related to the clusters temporally evolved with a characteristic temporal structure and showed mutual temporal alternations over minutes. The voxel-based representation allowed the decoding of activation patterns of the clusters in rs-fMRI using a meta-analysis of functional activations. The activation patterns of the clusters were correlated with behavioral measures. Taken together, our analysis highlights a novel approach to examine brain activity dynamics during rest.

Susceptibility artifact correction for sub-millimeter fMRI using inverse phase encoding registration and T1 weighted regularization	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Susceptibility artifact; Echo-planar imaging; Sub-millimeter fMRI; Inverse phase-encoding; T-1w guided regularization	POINT-SPREAD FUNCTION; IMAGE DISTORTION CORRECTION; ECHO-PLANAR IMAGES; GEOMETRIC DISTORTION; EPI; MRI; BRAIN	Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive examination of both the structure and the function of the human brain. The prevalence of high spatial-resolution (sub-millimeter) fMRI has triggered new research on the intra-cortex, such as cortical columns and cortical layers. At present, echo-planar imaging (EPI) is used exclusively to acquire fMRI data; however, susceptibility artifacts are unavoidable. These distortions are especially severe in high spatial-resolution images and can lead to misrepresentation of brain function in fMRI experiments. New method: This paper presents a new method for correcting susceptibility artifacts by combining a T1-weighted (T-1w) image and inverse phase-encoding (PE) based registration. The latter uses two EPI images acquired using identical sequences but with inverse-PE directions. In the proposed method, the T-1w image is used to regularize the registration, and to select the regularization parameters automatically. The motivation is that the T-1w image is considered to reflect the anatomical structure of the brain. Results: Our proposed method is evaluated on two sub-millimeter EPI-fMRI datasets, acquired using 3T and 7T scanners. Experiments show that the proposed method provides improved corrections that are well-aligned to the T-1w image. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method provides more robust and sharper corrections and runs faster compared with two other state-of-the-art inverse-PE based correction methods, i.e. HySCO and TOPUP. Conclusions: The proposed correction method used the T-1w image as a reference in the inverse-PE registration. Results show its promising performance. Our proposed method is timely, as sub-millimeter fMRI has become increasingly popular.	[Duong, S. T. M.; Phung, S.

Behavioural relevance of spontaneous, transient brain network interactions in fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	How spontaneously fluctuating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in different brain regions relate to behaviour has been an open question for decades. Correlations in these signals, known as functional connectivity, can be averaged over several minutes of data to provide a stable representation of the functional network architecture for an individual. However, associations between these stable features and behavioural traits have been shown to be dominated by individual differences in anatomy. Here, using kernel learning tools, we propose methods to assess and compare the relation between time-varying functional connectivity, time-averaged functional connectivity, structural brain data, and non-imaging subject behavioural traits. We applied these methods to Human Connectome Project resting-state fMRI data to show that time-varying fMRI functional connectivity, detected at time-scales of a few seconds, has associations with some behavioural traits that are not dominated by anatomy. Despite time-averaged functional connectivity accounting for the largest proportion of variability in the fMRI signal between individuals, we found that some aspects of intelligence could only be explained by time-varying functional connectivity. The finding that time-varying fMRI functional connectivity has a unique relationship to population behavioural variability suggests that it might reflect transient neuronal communication fluctuating around a stable neural architecture.

Dynamic functional network connectivity based on spatial source phase maps of complex-valued fMRI data: Application to schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Complex -valued fMRI data; Spatial source phase; Dynamic functional network connectivity; (dFNC); Markov chains; Schizophrenia	AUDITORY VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; ICA; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; BIPOLAR	Background: Dynamic spatial functional network connectivity (dsFNC) has shown advantages in detecting functional alterations impacted by mental disorders using magnitude-only fMRI data. However, complete fMRI data are complex-valued with unique and useful phase information. Methods: We propose dsFNC of spatial source phase (SSP) maps, derived from complex-valued fMRI data (named SSP-dsFNC), to capture the dynamics elicited by the phase. We compute mutual information for connectivity quantification, employ statistical analysis and Markov chains to assess dynamics, ultimately classifying schizophrenia patients (SZs) and healthy controls (HCs) based on connectivity variance and Markov chain state transitions across windows. Results: SSP-dsFNC yielded greater dynamics and more significant HC-SZ differences, due to the use of complete brain information from complex-valued fMRI data. Comparison with Existing Methods: Compared with magnitude-dsFNC, SSP-dsFNC detected additional and meaningful connections across windows (e.g., for right frontal parietal) and achieved 14.6% higher accuracy for classifying HCs and SZs. Conclusions: This work provides new evidence about how SSP-dsFNC could be impacted by schizophrenia, and this information could be used to identify potential imaging biomarkers for psychotic diagnosis.

To date, the majority of real-time resting-state fMRI studies have examined a limited number of brain regions. This is, in part, due to the computational demands of traditional seed- and independent component analysis-based methods, in particular when using increasingly available high-speed fMRI methods. Methods:This study describes a computationally efficient, real-time, seed-based, resting-state fMRI analysis pipeline using moving averaged sliding-windows (ASW) with partial correlations and regression of motion parameters and signals from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Results:Analytical and numerical analyses of ASW correlation and sliding-window regression as a function of window width show selectable bandpass filter characteristics and effective suppression of artifactual correlations resulting from signal drifts and transients. The analysis pipeline is compatible with multislab echo-volumar imaging and simultaneous multislice echo-planar imaging with repetition times as short as 136 msec. High-speed, resting-state fMRI data in healthy controls demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for minimizing artifactual correlations in white and gray matter, which was comparable to conventional regression across the entire scan. Integrating sliding-window averaging (width:W-1) within a second-level sliding-window (width:W-2) enabled monitoring of intra- and internetwork correlation dynamics of up to 12 resting-state networks with bandpass filter characteristics determined by the first-level sliding-window and temporal resolution W-1+W-2. Conclusions:The computational performance and confound tolerance make this seed-based, resting-state fMRI approach suitable for real-time monitoring of data quality and resting-state connectivity dynamics in neuroscience and clinical research studies. Impact statement Using averaged sliding-windows for seed-based correlation and regression of confounding signals provides a powerful model-free approach to increase tolerance to artifactual signal transients in resting-state analysis. The algorithmic efficiency of this sliding-window approach enables real-time, seed-based, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of multiple networks with computation of connectivity matrices and online monitoring of data quality. Integration of a second-level sliding-window enables mapping of resting-state connectivity dynamics. Sensitivity and tolerance to confounding signals compare favorably with conventional correlation and confound regression across the entire scan. This methodological advance has the potential to enhance the clinical utility of resting-state fMRI and facilitate neuroscience applications.

This study aimed to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural network contributing to visual organization abilities in children and adolescents. A two-choice version of the Hooper Visual Organization Test (T-HVOT) was adapted as the fMRI task for the present study. The effects of age and gender on overall visual perceptual functions and related neural foundations were also analyzed. Seventy children and adolescents were administered with the Test of Visual Perceptual Skill-Third Edition and 41 completed the fMRI scans. The whole-brain fMRI mapping results showed the cortical activation of multiple brain areas relating to visual organization. The greatest cortical activities were seen in the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, and two age groups showed significant differences in cortical activation patterns as well. Gender had no significant effects on visual perceptual functions nor related cortical activation patterns. The overall visual perception functions improve with age, and the different cortical activation patterns indicated that the two groups adopt different strategies while performing visual organization tasks. The sensitivity and spatial resolution of fMRI allowed us to make specific conclusions about cortical regions involved in visual organization function and to provide a reference for objectively judging rehabilitative outcomes.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive, powerful technique able to map activity of brain regions and to assess how such regions interact for an efficient brain network. FMRI has been widely applied to study functional brain changes in MS, allowing to investigate functional plasticity consequent to disease-related structural injury. The first studies in MS using active fMRI tasks mainly aimed to study such plastic changes by identifying abnormal activity in salient brain regions (or systems) involved by the task. In later studies the focus shifted towards resting state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) studies, which aimed to map large-scale functional networks of the brain and to establish how MS pathology impairs functional integration, eventually leading to the hypothesized network collapse as patients clinically progress. This review provides a summary of the main findings from studies using task-based and RS fMRI and illustrates how functional brain alterations relate to clinical disability and cognitive deficits in this condition. We also give an overview of longitudinal studies that used task-based and RS fMRI to monitor disease evolution and effects of motor and cognitive rehabilitation. In addition, we discuss the results of studies using newer technologies involving time-varying FC to investigate abnormal dynamism and flexibility of network configurations in MS. Finally, we show some preliminary results from two recent topics (i.e., multimodal MRI analysis and artificial intelligence) that are receiving increasing attention. Together, these functional studies could provide new (conceptual) insights into disease stage-specific mechanisms underlying progression in MS, with recommendations for future research.

However, a recent large-scale study (n = 28,638) found no such correlation, which is probably due to the low precision of fMRI measurements. To address this issue, we used simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking measurements during a commonly employed emotional face recognition task. Eye-tracking provide high-precision data, which can be used to enrich and potentially stabilize fMRI readouts. With the behavioral response, we additionally divided the active task period into a task-related and a free-viewing phase to explore the gaze patterns of MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) and compare their respective neural correlates. Our analysis showed that a mood-congruency attentional bias could be detected in MDD compared to healthy controls during the free-viewing phase but without parallel amygdala disruption. Moreover, the neural correlates of gaze patterns reflected more prefrontal fMRI activity in the free-viewing than the task-related phase. Taken together, spontaneous emotional processing in free viewing might lead to a more pronounced mood-congruency bias in MDD, which indicates that combined fMRI with eye-tracking measurement could be beneficial for our understanding of the underlying psychopathology of MDD in different emotional processing phases.Trial Registration: The BeCOME study is registered on ClinicalTrials (gov: NCT03984084) by the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany.

Deep learning techniques have played a critical role in advancing decoding models for visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data. Particularly, the use of advanced GANs has resulted in significant improvements in the quality of image generation, providing a powerful tool for addressing the challenges of this complex task. However, none of these studies have taken into account the inherent characteristics of the stimulus contents themselves; This, in turn, leads to unsatisfactory outcomes, as demonstrated by the inconsistent identity between reconstructed faces and ground truth in the decoding of facial images. In order to tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy of reconstructing facial images from fMRI data. Our key innovation involves extracting and disentangling multi -level visual information from brain signals in the latent space and optimizing high-level features for facial identity control using identity loss. Specifically, our framework uses StyleGAN inversion to extract hierarchical latent codes from images, which are then bridged to fMRI data through transformation blocks. Additionally, we introduce a multi -stage refinement method to enhance the accuracy of reconstructed faces, which involves progressively updating fMRI latent codes with custom loss functions designed for both feature- and image -wise optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively achieves two critical objectives: (1) accurate facial image reconstruction from fMRI data and (2) preservation of identity characteristics with a high level of consistency.

Treatment outcomes have therefore been predicted using lesion-to-symptom mapping, but this method lacks holistic functional information about the language-network. This study, therefore, aims to develop whole-brain task-fMRI multivariate analysis to neurobiologically inspect lesion impacts on the language-network and predict behavioral outcomes in persons with aphasia (PWA) undergoing language therapy. In 14 chronic PWA, semantic fluency task-fMRI and behavioral measures were collected to develop prediction methodologies for post-treatment outcomes. Then, a recently developed imaging-based multivariate method to predict behavior (i.e., LESYMAP) was optimized to intake whole-brain task-fMRI data, and systematically tested for reliability with mass univariate methods. We also accounted for lesion size in both methods. Results showed that both mass univariate and multivariate methods identified unique biomarkers for semantic fluency improvements from baseline to 2-weeks post-treatment. Additionally, both methods demonstrated reliable spatial overlap in task-specific areas including the right middle frontal gyrus when identifying biomarkers of language discourse. Thus whole-brain task-fMRI multivariate analysis has the potential to identify functionally meaningful prognostic biomarkers even for relatively small sample sizes. In sum, our task-fMRI based multivariate approach holistically estimates post-treatment response for both word and sentence production and may serve as a complementary tool to mass univariate analysis in developing brain-behavior relationships for improved personalization of aphasia rehabilitation regimens.

Brain-wide functional connectivity of face patch neurons during rest	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						simultaneous fMRI and neurophysiology; single units; resting state; face patches; brain networks	MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; TEMPORAL AREAS TE; SUBCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; STEM CORE; FMRI; FLUCTUATIONS; BOLD; PROJECTIONS; DYNAMICS; THALAMUS	The brain is a highly organized, dynamic system whose network architecture is often assessed through resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity. The functional interactions between brain areas, including those observed during rest, are assumed to stem from the collective influence of action potentials carried by long-range neural projections. However, the contribution of individual neurons to brain-wide functional connectivity has not been systematically assessed. Here we developed a method to concurrently measure and compare the spiking activity of local neurons with fMRI signals measured across the brain during rest. We recorded spontaneous activity from neural populations in cortical face patches in the macaque during fMRI scanning sessions. Individual cells exhibited prominent, bilateral coupling with fMRI fluctuations in a restricted set of cortical areas inside and outside the face patch network, partially matching the pattern of known anatomical projections. Within each face patch population, a subset of neurons was positively coupled with the face patch network and another was negatively coupled. The same cells showed inverse correlations with distinct subcortical structures, most notably the lateral geniculate nucleus and brainstem neuromodulatory centers. Corresponding connectivity maps derived from fMRI seeds and local field potentials differed from the single unit maps, particularly in subcortical areas. Together, the results demonstrate that the spiking fluctuations of neurons are selectively coupled with discrete brain regions, with the coupling governed in part by anatomical network connections and in part by indirect neuromodulatory pathways.

These changes may thus be used as biomarkers for early detection. This review aimed to determine the role of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in detecting brain functional changes.MethodsA systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases in June 2022. Patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy and periodic rs-fMRI assessments were included. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the potential of rs-fMRI for detecting brain changes.ResultsTen studies with a total of 513 subjects (head and neck cancer patients, n = 437; healthy controls, n = 76) were included. A significance of rs-fMRI for detecting brain changes in the temporal and frontal lobes, cingulate cortex, and cuneus was demonstrated in most studies. These changes were reported to be associated with dose (6/10 studies) and latency (4/10 studies). A strong effect size (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) between rs-fMRI and brain changes was also reported, suggesting rs-fMRI's capability for monitoring brain alterations.ConclusionResting-state functional MRI is a promising tool for detecting brain functional changes following head and neck radiotherapy. These changes are correlated with latency and prescription dose.

However, due to the indirect nature of the fMRI signal, it has been challenging to relate these fMRI observations to actual neuronal response properties. To bridge this gap, we present a forward model of the fMRI responses to natural sounds combining a neuronal model of the auditory cortex with physiological modeling of the hemodynamic BOLD response. Neuronal responses are modeled with a dynamic recurrent firing rate model, reflecting the tonotopic, hierarchical processing in the auditory cortex along with the spectro-temporal tradeoffin the rostral-caudal axis of its belt areas. To link modeled neuronal response properties with human fMRI data in the auditory belt regions, we generated a space of neuronal models, which differed parametrically in spectral and temporal specificity of neuronal responses. Then, we obtained predictions of fMRI responses through a biophysical model of the hemodynamic BOLD response (P-DCM). Using Bayesian model comparison, our results showed that the hemodynamic BOLD responses of the caudal belt regions in the human auditory cortex were best explained by modeling faster temporal dynamics and broader spectral tuning of neuronal populations, while rostral belt regions were best explained through fine spectral tuning combined with slower temporal dynamics. These results support the hypotheses of complementary neural information processing along the rostral-caudal axis of the human superior temporal gyrus.

Although being increasingly adopted in the mapping of the flow of neural activity, the mechanism that gives rise to the BOLD signal time lag remains controversial. In the present study, we compared the time lag of the global mean signal with those of the local network components obtained by applying temporal independent component analysis to the resting-state fMRI data, as well as by using simultaneous wide-field visual stimulation, and demonstrated that the time lag patterns are highly similar across all types of data. These results suggest that the time lag of the rs-fMRI signal reflects the local variance of the hemodynamic responses rather than the arrival or transit time of the stimulus, whether the trigger is neuronal or non-neuronal in origin as long as it is mediated by local hemodynamic responses. Examinations of the internal carotid artery signal further confirmed that the arterial signal is tightly inversely coupled with the global mean signal in accordance with previous studies, presumably reflecting the blood flow or blood pressure changes that are occurring almost simultaneously in the internal carotid artery and the cerebral pial/capillary arteries, within the low-frequency component in human rs-fMRI.

But they are based on empirical correlations that can produce unreliable results in high dimension low sample size settings. A family of statistical estimators, the covariance shrinkage methods, could mitigate this issue. Unfortunately, these methods have rarely been used to correct functional connectomes and no extensive experiment has been conducted so far to compare the shrinkage methods available for this task. In this work, we propose to fix this issue by processing a benchmark dataset made of a thousand high-resolution resting-state fMRI scans provided by the Human Connectome Project to compare the ability of five prominent covariance shrinkage methods to produce reliable functional connectomes at different spatial resolutions and scans duration: the pioneer linear covariance shrinkage method introduced by Ledoit and Wolf, the Oracle Approximating Shrinkage, the QuEST method, the NERCOME method, and a recent analytical approximation of the QuEST approach. Our experiments establish that all covariance shrinkage methods significantly improve functional connectomes derived from short fMRI scans. The Oracle Approximating Shrinkage and the QuEST method produced the best results. Lastly, we present shrinkage intensity charts that can be used for designing and analyzing fMRI studies. These charts indicate that sparse connectomes are difficult to estimate from short fMRI scans, and they describe a range of settings where dynamic functional connectivity should not be computed.

In both SZ and MDD there was common stronger fMRI response in right medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which are part of the default mode network (DMN). The effects were of greater magnitude in SZ than MDD, especially in prefrontal-temporal-cingulate-striatal-cerebellar regions. In addition, a disorder-specific weaker fMRI response was observed in right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in MDD, relative to HC. For both SZ and MDD a significant correlation was observed between the severity of clinical symptoms and lateralized fMRI response relative to HC. These findings indicate that there may be common and distinct anomalies in brain function underlying deficits in WM in SZ and MDD, which may serve as a potential functional neuroimaging-based diagnostic biomarker with value in supporting clinical diagnosis, measuring illness severity and assessing the efficacy of treatments for SZ and MDD at the brain level.

However, there is no consensus of opinion on task-fMRI imaging findings of the suicidal brain. We performed a meta-analysis to integrate the results of reported studies to find the consistent task-related alteration pattern of brain activations in MDD patients with suicidal behavior, aiming to investigate brain functional alterations in association with a vulnerability to suicidal behavior. Using the SDM (Seed-based d Mapping) method, we conducted a meta-analysis of the task-fMRI studies to compare the brain activations between major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with a history of suicidal behavior (suicide attempter, ATT) and the MDD patients without suicidal behavior (non-attempters, NAT) during tasks. Our systematic search identified 7 task-fMRI studies comprising 366 individuals, i.e., 150 ATT and 216 NAT. We found that brain activation in ATT increased in the left insula, while decreased in the bilateral fusiform gyrus compared to NAT during the fMRI tasks. We found the brain activation changes in the insula and fusiform gyrus in MDD patients with a history of suicide attempt during fMRI tasks. The brain activation changes in these regions were associated with the dysfunction of emotion regulation, processing negative information and self-awareness which may increase the vulnerability of suicidal behavior in MDD patients.

Changes in functional connectivity in people with HIV switching antiretroviral therapy	JOURNAL OF NEUROVIROLOGY			English	Article						HIV; fMRI; Neuropsychological assessment; Memory; Attention	LINE BISECTION JUDGMENTS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN ACTIVATION; ADVERSE EVENTS; FMRI; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; ROBUST; CNS	We assessed changes in functional connectivity by fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and cognitive measures in otherwise neurologically asymptomatic people with HIV (PWH) switching combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In a prospective study (baseline and follow-up after at least 4 months), virologically suppressed PWH switched non-nuclease reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI; tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine with efavirenz to rilpivirine) and integrase-strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTI; tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine with raltegravir to dolutegravir). PWH were assessed by resting-state fMRI and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) task fMRI as well as with a cognitive battery (CogState (TM)) at baseline and follow-up. Switching from efavirenz to rilpivirine (n = 10) was associated with increased functional connectivity in the dorsal attention network (DAN) and a reduction in SSRTs (p = 0.025) that positively correlated with the time previously on efavirenz (mean = 4.8 years, p = 0.02). Switching from raltegravir to dolutegravir (n = 12) was associated with increased connectivity in the left DAN and bilateral sensory-motor and associative visual networks. In the NNRTI study, significant improvements in the cognitive domains of executive function, working memory and speed of visual processing were observed, whereas no significant changes in cognitive function were observed in the INSTI study. Changes in fMRI are evident in PWH without perceived neuropsychiatric complaints switching cART. fMRI may be a useful tool in assisting to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of cART-related neuropsychiatric effects.

Emerging connectivity metrics such as k-core may capture these differences, highlighting crucial network components based on resiliency. We investigated the influence of bilingualism on clinical fMRI language tasks and characterized bilingual networks using connectivity metrics to provide a patient care benchmark. Sixteen right-handed subjects (mean age 42-years; nine males) without neurological history were included: eight native English-speaking monolinguals and eight native Spanish-speaking (L1) bilinguals with acquired English (L2). All subjects underwent fMRI with gold-standard clinical language tasks. Starting from active clusters on fMRI, we inferred the persistent functional network across subjects and ran centrality measures to characterize differences. Our results demonstrated a persistent network "core" consisting of Broca's area, the pre-supplementary motor area, and the premotor area. K-core analysis showed that Wernicke's area was engaged by the "core" with weaker connection in L2 than L1.

Random matrix theory (RMT)-based principal component analysis (PCA) is promising to reduce such noise in fMRI data. However, there is no consensus about the optimal strategy and practice in implementation. In this work, we propose a comprehensive RMT-based denoising method that consists of 1) rank and noise estimation based on a set of newly derived multiple criteria, and 2) optimal singular value shrinkage, with each module explained and implemented based on the RMT. By incorporating the variance stabilizing approach, the denoising method can deal with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (such as <5) magnitude fMRI data with favorable performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Results from both simulation and in-vivo high-resolution fMRI data show that the proposed denoising method dramatically improves image restoration quality, promoting functional sensitivity at the same level of functional mapping blurring compared to existing denoising methods. Moreover, the denoising method can serve as a drop-in step in data preprocessing pipelines along with other procedures aimed at removal of structured physiological noises. We expect that the proposed denoising method will play an important role in leveraging high-quality, high-resolution task fMRI, which is desirable in many neuroscience and clinical applications.

Due to the heterogeneity of medical data generated by different hospitals, it is very important to analyze and integrate data from different institutions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in clinical medicine and cognitive neuroscience, while resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can help reveal functional biomarkers of neurological disorders for computer-assisted clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Recently, how to retrieve similar images or case histories from large-scale medical image repositories acquired from multiple sites has attracted widespread attention in the field of intelligent diagnosis of diseases. Although using multisite data effectively helps increase the sample size, it also inevitably introduces the problem of data heterogeneity across sites. To address this problem, we propose a multisite fMRI retrieval (MSFR) method that uses a deep hashing approach and an optimal transport-based domain adaptation strategy to mitigate multisite data heterogeneity for accurate fMRI search. Specifically, for a given target domain site and multiple source domain sites, our approach uses a deep neural network to map the source and target domain data into the latent feature space and minimize their Wasserstein distance to reduce their distribution differences. We then use the source domain data to learn high-quality hash code through a global similarity metric, thereby improving the performance of crosssite fMRI retrieval. We evaluated our method on the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in resting-state fMRI retrieval.

Theory and Methods: The magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG) sequence with 3D non-Cartesian trajectory and 0.1s repetition time (TR) was applied to acquire fMRI datasets. Different from a conventional time-point-by-time-point sequential reconstruction (SR), the proposed time-domain principal component reconstruction (tPCR) performs three steps: (1) decomposing the k-t-space fMRI datasets into time-domain principal component space using singular value decomposition, (2) reconstructing each principal component with redistributed computation power according to their weights, and (3) combining the reconstructed principal components back to image-t-space. The comparison of reconstruction accuracy was performed by simulation experiments and then verified in real fMRI data. Results: The simulation experiments showed that the proposed tPCR was able to significantly reduce reconstruction errors, and subsequent functional activation errors, relative to SR at identical computational cost. Alternatively, at fixed reconstruction accuracy, computation time was greatly reduced. The improved performance was particularly obvious for L1-norm nonlinear reconstructions relative to L2-norm linear reconstructions and robust to different regularization strength, undersampling rates, and off-resonance effects intensity. By examining activation maps, tPCR was also found to give similar improvements in real fMRI experiments. Conclusion: The proposed proof-of-concept tPCR framework could improve (1) the reconstruction efficiency of iterative reconstruction, and (2) the reconstruction stability especially for nonlinear reconstructions. As a practical consideration, the improved reconstruction speed promotes the application of highly undersampled non-Cartesian fast fMRI.

Multimodal neuroimaging methodology provides a continuously evolving platform. Being able to combine calcium imaging, optogenetics, electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as part of the numerous efforts on brain functional mapping, we have a unique opportunity to better understand brain function. This review will focus on the developments in application of these tools within fMRI studies and highlight the challenges and choices neurosciences face when designing multimodal experiments.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment is employed to identify four brain regions with significant activations during motor imagery (MI) and the effective connections between these regions of interest (ROIs) were calculated using Dynamic Window-level Granger Causality (DWGC). Then, a real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) classification system for left- and right-hand MI is developed using the Open-NFT platform. We conducted data acquisition and processing on three subjects, and all of whom were recruited from a local college. As a result, the maximum accuracy of using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on real-time three-class classification (rest, left hand, and right hand) with effective connections is 69.3%. And it is 3% higher than that of traditional multivoxel pattern classification analysis on average. Moreover, it significantly improves classification accuracy during the initial stage of MI tasks while reducing the latency effects in real-time decoding. The study suggests that the effective connections obtained through the DWGC method serve as valuable features for real-time decoding of MI using fMRI. Moreover, they exhibit higher sensitivity to changes in brain states. This research offers theoretical support and technical guidance for extracting neural signal features in the context of fMRI-based studies.

While invasive mapping is the gold standard, there is increasing interest in using noninvasive fMRI to shorten and improve the process. How-ever, many surgical patients cannot adequately perform task-based fMRI protocols. Resting-state fMRI has emerged as an alternative modality, but automated eloquent cortex localization remains an open chal-lenge. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning architecture to simultaneously identify language and primary motor cortex from rs-fMRI connectivity. Our approach uses the representational power of convolutional neural networks alongside the generalization power of multi-task learning to find a shared representation between the eloquent subnetworks. We validate our method on data from the publicly available Human Connectome Project and on a brain tumor dataset acquired at the Johns Hopkins Hos-pital. We compare our method against feature-based machine learning approaches and a fully-connected deep learning model that does not account for the shared network organization of the data. Our model achieves significantly better performance than competing baselines. We also assess the generalizability and robustness of our method. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our graph convolution architecture combined with multi-task learning and highlight the promise of using rs-fMRI as a presurgi-cal mapping tool.

J	Frank, LE; Zeithamova, D				Frank, Lea E.; Zeithamova, Dagmar			Evaluating methods for measuring background connectivity in slow event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging designs	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						background connectivity; connectivity fingerprint; individual differences; resting-state functional connectivity; task-based functional connectivity	DISTINCT BRAIN NETWORKS; CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY; ATTENTION; CORTEX; FMRI; ARCHITECTURE; VARIABILITY; CONNECTOME	Introduction: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used for measuring functional interactions between brain regions, significantly contributing to our understanding of large-scale brain networks and brain-behavior relationships. Furthermore, idiosyncratic patterns of resting-state connections can be leveraged to identify individuals and predict individual differences in clinical symptoms, cognitive abilities, and other individual factors. Idiosyncratic connectivity patterns are thought to persist across task states, suggesting task-based fMRI can be similarly leveraged for individual differences analyses.Method: Here, we tested the degree to which functional interactions occurring in the background of a task during slow event-related fMRI parallel or differ from those captured during resting-state fMRI. We compared two approaches for removing task-evoked activity from task-based fMRI: (1) applying a low-pass filter to remove task-related frequencies in the signal, or (2) extracting residuals from a general linear model (GLM) that accounts for task-evoked responses.Result: We found that the organization of large-scale cortical networks and individual's idiosyncratic connectivity patterns are preserved during task-based fMRI. In contrast, individual differences in connection strength can vary more substantially between rest and task. Compared to low-pass filtering, background connectivity obtained from GLM residuals produced idiosyncratic connectivity patterns and individual differences in connection strength that more resembled rest. However, all background connectivity measures were highly similar when derived from the low-pass-filtered signal or GLM residuals, indicating that both methods are suitable for measuring background connectivity.Conclusion: Together, our results highlight new avenues for the analysis of task-based fMRI datasets and the utility of each background connectivity method.

The effects of multi-echo fMRI combination and rapid T<sub>2</sub>*-mapping on offline and real-time BOLD sensitivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Real-time; Multi-echo; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Neurofeedback; Adaptive paradigms; Methods development; Finger tapping; Motor; Emotion processing; Amygdala; Task; Resting state	CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; EPI; QUANTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; ENHANCEMENT; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION; TOOLBOX; SIGNAL; BRAIN	A variety of strategies are used to combine multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, yet recent literature lacks a systematic comparison of the available options. Here we compare six different approaches derived from multi-echo data and evaluate their influences on BOLD sensitivity for offline and in particular realtime use cases: a single-echo time series (based on Echo 2), the real-time T 2 *-mapped time series ( T 2 * FIT ) and four combined time series ( T 2 *-weighted, tSNR-weighted, TE-weighted, and a new combination scheme termed T 2 * FIT-weighted). We compare the influences of these six multi-echo derived time series on BOLD sensitivity using a healthy participant dataset ( N = 28) with four task-based fMRI runs and two resting state runs. We show that the T 2 * FIT-weighted combination yields the largest increase in temporal signal-to-noise ratio across task and resting state runs. We demonstrate additionally for all tasks that the T 2 * FIT time series consistently yields the largest offline effect size measures and real-time region-of-interest based functional contrasts and temporal contrast-to noise ratios. These improvements show the promising utility of multi-echo fMRI for studies employing real-time paradigms, while further work is advised to mitigate the decreased tSNR of the T 2 * FIT time series. We recommend the use and continued exploration of T 2 * FIT for offline task-based and real-time region-based fMRI analysis.

Likewise, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows the study of olfactory function. This suggests that by quantitatively studying the olfactory function with an olfactory paradigm through fMRI it is possible to identify the functional alteration produced by the epileptic focus. The objective of the present study was to assess the olfactory function in the side of the epileptic focus in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, using fMRI for smell, and propose a non-invasive diagnostic method for patients candidates to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. Methods: Patients (n = 18) with clinical diagnosis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, refractory to pharmacological treatment: 7 patients (38.9%) with non-invasive studies consistent enough to submit them to anterior temporal lobectomy, and 11 (61.1%) patients where focal onset seizures were identified by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) on the left temporal lobe in 5 (27.8%) and in both temporal lobes in 2 (11.1%). Patients were evaluated using EEG, MRI, neuropsychological data, and fMRI with olfactory paradigm. Results of the fMRI were compared with the laterality of the epileptic focus determined by intracranial electroencephalogram recordings through stereotactically placed electrodes, and with post-surgical outcome at one year of follow-up. Results: fMRI showed a lower olfactory activation in 81.8% concordant with unilateral onset seizures. There were significant differences of olfactory fMRI activation between epileptic and non-epileptic foci. Conclusion: Functional magnetic resonance imaging with an olfactory paradigm may be a non-invasive diagnostic tool to determine the laterality of seizure onset in the mesial temporal lobe.

The team reviewed the following available diagnostic data: video-electroencephalography (n = 51), structural MRI (n = 51), FDG-PET (n = 42), magnetoencephalography (n = 5), and neuropsychological testing (n = 51) results to formulate an initial surgery plan blinded to the rs-fMRI findings. Subsequent to this discussion, the connectivity results were revealed and final recommendations were established. Changes between pre- and post-rs-fMRI treatment plans were determined, and changes in surgery recommendation were compared using McNemar's test. RESULTS Resting-state fMRI was successfully performed in 50 (98%) of 51 cases and changed the seizure onset zone localization in 44 (88%) of 50 patients. The connectivity results prompted 6 additional studies, eliminated the ordering of 11 further diagnostic studies, and changed the intracranial monitoring plan in 10 cases. The connectivity results significantly altered surgery planning with the addition of 13 surgeries, but it did not eliminate planned surgeries (p = 0.003). Among the 38 epilepsy surgeries performed, the final surgical approach changed due to rs-fMRI findings in 22 cases (58%), including 8 (28%) of 29 in which extraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping was averted. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the impact of rs-fMRI connectivity results on the decision-making for pediatric epilepsy surgery by providing new information about the location of eloquent cortex and the seizure onset zone. Additionally, connectivity results may increase the proportion of patients considered eligible for surgery while optimizing the need for further testing.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to identify changes in neural activity in MCI. MethodsWe investigated neural activity changes in the visual network of the aMCI patients (n:20) and healthy persons (n:17) using resting-state fMRI and visual oddball task fMRI. We used independent component analysis to identify regions of interest and compared the activity between groups using a false discovery rate correction. ResultsResting-state fMRI revealed increased activity in the areas that have functional connectivity with the visual network, including the right superior and inferior lateral occipital cortex, the right angular gyrus and the temporo-occipital part of the right middle temporal gyrus (p-FDR = 0.008) and decreased activity in the bilateral thalamus and caudate nuclei, which are part of the frontoparietal network in the aMCI group (p-FDR = 0.002). In the visual oddball task fMRI, decreased activity was found in the right frontal pole, the right frontal orbital cortex, the left superior parietal lobule, the right postcentral gyrus, the right posterior part of the supramarginal gyrus, the right superior part of the lateral occipital cortex, and the right angular gyrus in the aMCI group. ConclusionOur results suggest the alterations in the visual network are present in aMCI patients, both during resting-state and task-based fMRI. These changes may represent early biomarkers of aMCI and highlight the importance of assessing visual processing in cognitive impairment. However, future studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs are needed to confirm these findings.

Regression dynamic causal modeling for resting-state fMRI	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						connectomics; effective connectivity; generative model; hierarchy; regression dynamic causal modeling; resting state	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT-MODE; BRAIN NETWORKS; SCHIZOPHRENIA NETWORK; DORSAL ATTENTION; SALIENCE NETWORK; HUMAN CONNECTOME; MOTION ARTIFACT; GLOBAL SIGNAL; ARCHITECTURE	"Resting-state" functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study brain connectivity. So far, researchers have been restricted to measures of functional connectivity that are computationally efficient but undirected, or to effective connectivity estimates that are directed but limited to small networks. Here, we show that a method recently developed for task-fMRI-regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM)-extends to rs-fMRI and offers both directional estimates and scalability to whole-brain networks. First, simulations demonstrate that rDCM faithfully recovers parameter values over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and repetition times. Second, we test construct validity of rDCM in relation to an established model of effective connectivity, spectral DCM. Using rs-fMRI data from nearly 200 healthy participants, rDCM produces biologically plausible results consistent with estimates by spectral DCM. Importantly, rDCM is computationally highly efficient, reconstructing whole-brain networks (>200 areas) within minutes on standard hardware. This opens promising new avenues for connectomics.

A recent study argued that it is possible to detect neuroelectrical potentials using a specialized fMRI scanning approach the authors termed "direct imaging of neuronal activity" (DIANA). We implemented DIANA in anesthetized rats and measured responses to somatosensory stimulation, reproducing core findings of the original study. We show, however, that neural activity is neither sufficient nor necessary to produce such results. We use a combination of control conditions and simulations to demonstrate that DIANA signals can arise from nonideal aspects of the pulse sequence and specimen that help determine spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Our analysis emphasizes a need for cautious interpretation and mechanistic evaluation of advanced fMRI techniques.

Here, we investigated whether the degree to which individuals think others positively view them (reflected impression) is similarly tracked by activity in the vmPFC by using fMRI and speed-dating events. We also examined whether activity of the vmPFC in response to the faces of others would predict the impression formed through direct interactions with them. The task consisted of three sessions: pre-speed-dating fMRI, speed-dating events, and post-speed-dating fMRI (not reported here). During the pre-speed-dating fMRI, each participant passively viewed the faces of others whom they would meet in the subsequent speed-dating events. After the fMRI, they rated the impression and reflected impression of each face. During the speed-dating events, the participants had 3-min conversations with partners whose faces were presented during the fMRI task, and they were asked to choose the partners whom they preferred at the end of the events. The results revealed that the value of both the impression and reflected impression were automatically represented in the vmPFC. However, the impression fully mediated the link between the reflected impression and vmPFC activity. These results highlight a close link between reflected appraisal and impression formation and provide important insights into neural and psychological models of how the reflected impression is formed in the human brain.

Therefore, spatial agreement and temporal correlation may not be reproducible across studies. In the present work, we address this issue by proposing a novel method for integration and analysis of fNIRS and fMRI over the cortical surface. Materials and methods: Eighteen healthy volunteers (age mean +/- SD 30.55 +/- 4.7, 7 males) performed a motor task during non-simultaneous fMRI and fNIRS acquisitions. First, fNIRS and fMRI data were integrated by projecting subject- and group-level source maps over the cortical surface mesh to define anatomically constrained functional ROIs (acfROI). Next, spatial agreement and temporal correlation were quantified as Dice Coefficient (DC) and Pearson's correlation coefficient between fNIRS-fMRI in the acfROIs.Results: Subject-level results revealed moderate to substantial spatial agreement (DC range 0.43 - 0.64), confirmed at the group-level only for blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal vs. HbO2 (0.44 - 0.69), while lack of agreement was found for BOLD vs. HbR in some instances (0.05 - 0.49). Subject-level temporal correlation was moderate to strong (0.79 - 0.85 for BOLD vs. HbO2 and -0.62 to -0.72 for BOLD vs. HbR), while an overall strong correlation was found for group-level results (0.95 - 0.98 for BOLD vs. HbO2 and -0.91 to -0.94 for BOLD vs. HbR).Conclusion: The proposed method directly compares fNIRS and fMRI by projecting individual source maps to the cortical surface. Our results indicate spatial and temporal correspondence between fNIRS and fMRI, and promotes the use of fNIRS when more ecological acquision settings are required, such as longitudinal monitoring of brain activity before and after rehabilitation.

For example, spatial and/or temporal patterns of functional brain activities embedded in fMRI data can be effectively characterized and modeled by a variety of CNN/DBN/RNN deep learning models as shown in recent studies. However, it has been rarely investigated whether it is possible to directly infer hierarchical brain networks from volumetric fMRI data using deep learning models such as DBN. The perceived difficulties of such studies include very large number of input variables, very large number of training parameters, the lack of effective software tools, the challenge of results interpretation, and etc. To bridge these technical gaps, we designed a novel volumetric sparse deep belief network (VS-DBN) model and implemented it through the popular TensorFlow open source platform to reconstruct hierarchical brain networks from volumetric fMRI data based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 900 subjects release. Our experimental results showed that a large number of interpretable and meaningful brain networks can be robustly reconstructed from HCP 900 subjects in a hierarchical fashion, and importantly, these brain networks exhibit reasonably good consistency and correspondence across multiple HCP task-based fMRI datasets. Our work contributed a new general deep learning framework for inferring multiscale volumetric brain networks and offered novel insights into the hierarchical organization of functional brain architecture.

Connectome-based neurofeedback: A pilot study to improve sustained attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Real-time fMRI; Neurofeedback; Connectome-based predictive modeling; Functional connectivity; Attention	DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME FMRI NEUROFEEDBACK; PERFORMANCE; MOTION	Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological therapeutic tool that may be useful for training behavior and alleviating clinical symptoms. Although previous work has used rt-fMRI to target brain activity in or functional connectivity between a small number of brain regions, there is growing evidence that symptoms and behavior emerge from interactions between a number of distinct brain areas. Here, we propose a new method for rt-fMRI, connectome-based neurofeedback, in which intermittent feedback is based on the strength of complex functional networks spanning hundreds of regions and thousands of functional connections. We first demonstrate the technical feasibility of calculating whole-brain functional connectivity in real-time and provide resources for implementing connectome-based neurofeedback. We next show that this approach can be used to provide accurate feedback about the strength of a previously defined connectome-based model of sustained attention, the saCPM, during task performance. Although, in our initial pilot sample, neurofeedback based on saCPM strength did not improve performance on out-of-scanner attention tasks, future work characterizing effects of network target, training duration, and amount of feedback on the efficacy of rt-fMRI can inform experimental or clinical trial designs.

The brain networks that underlie these aspects of speech motor control remain poorly understood. Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants produced normal and fast rate speech in response to sequences of visually presented objects. We took a non-conventional approach to fMRI data analysis that allowed us to study speech motor behavior as it unfolded over time. To this end, whole-brain fMRI signals were extracted in stimulus-locked epochs using slice-based fMRI. These data were then subjected to group independent component analysis to discover spatially independent networks that were associated with different temporal activation profiles. The results revealed two basic brain networks with different temporal dynamics: a cortical network that was activated continuously during speech production, and a second cortico-subcortical network that increased in activity during the initiation and suppression of speech production. Additional analyses explored whether key areas involved in motor suppression such as the right inferior frontal gyrus, sub-thalamic nucleus and pre-supplementary motor area provide first-order signals to stop speech. The results reveal for the first time the brain networks associated with the initiation, maintenance, and suppression of speech motor behavior.

Given the important role of the anterior insula (AI) in human cognitive and affective processes, it has become one of the most investigated regions in rt-fMRI studies. Most rt-fMRI insula studies employed emotional recall/imagery as the regulation strategy, which may be less effective for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered emotional processing. The present study thus aimed to examine the feasibility of a novel interoceptive strategy based on heartbeat detection in rt-fMRI guided AI regulation and its associated behavioral changes using a randomized double-blind, sham feedback-controlled between-subject design. 66 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either NF from the left AI (LAI) or sham feedback from a control region while using the interoceptive strategy. N = 57 participants were included in the final data analyses. Empathic and interoceptive pre-post training changes were collected as behavioral measures of NF training effects. Results showed that participants in the NF group exhibited stronger LAI activity than the control group with LAI activity being positively correlated with interoceptive accuracy following NF training, although there were no significant increases of LAI activity over training sessions. Importantly, ability of LAI regulation could be maintained in a transfer session without feedback. Successful LAI regulation was associated with strengthened functional connectivity of the LAI with cognitive control, memory and learning, and salience/interoceptive networks. The present study demonstrated for the first time the efficacy of a novel regulation strategy based on interoceptive processing in up-regulating LAI activity. Our findings also provide proof of concept for the translational potential of this strategy in rt-fMRI AI regulation of psychiatric disorders characterized by altered emotional processing.

Modeling the Hemodynamic Response Function Using EEG-fMRI Data During Eyes-Open Resting-State Conditions and Motor Task Execution	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						BOLD; EEG-fMRI; Hemodynamic response function; Resting state	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; BOLD SIGNAL; GRADIENT ARTIFACT; BRAIN NETWORKS; VISUAL-CORTEX; ALPHA-RHYTHM; IDENTIFICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY	Being able to accurately quantify the hemodynamic response function (HRF) that links the blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) signal to the underlying neural activity is important both for elucidating neurovascular coupling mechanisms and improving the accuracy of fMRI-based functional connectivity analyses. In particular, HRF estimation using BOLD-fMRI is challenging particularly in the case of resting-state data, due to the absence of information about the underlying neuronal dynamics. To this end, using simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI data is a promising approach, as EEG provides a more direct measure of neural activations. In the present work, we employ simultaneous EEG-fMRI to investigate the regional characteristics of the HRF using measurements acquired during resting conditions. We propose a novel methodological approach based on combining distributed EEG source space reconstruction, which improves the spatial resolution of HRF estimation and using block-structured linear and nonlinear models, which enables us to simultaneously obtain HRF estimates and the contribution of different EEG frequency bands. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the resting-state BOLD signal can be sufficiently described using linear models and that the contribution of each band is region specific. Specifically, it was found that sensory-motor cortices exhibit positive HRF shapes, whereas the lateral occipital cortex and areas in the parietal cortex, such as the inferior and superior parietal lobule exhibit negative HRF shapes. To validate the proposed method, we repeated the analysis using simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements acquired during execution of a unimanual hand-grip task. Our results reveal significant associations between BOLD signal variations and electrophysiological power fluctuations in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex, particularly for the EEG beta band, in agreement with previous studies in the literature.

One of the most challenging brain decoding tasks is the accurate reconstruction of the perceived natural images from brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this work, we survey the most recent deep learning methods for natural image reconstruction from fMRI.

Sex differences in language organization may have important implications for language mapping performed to assess, and minimize neurosurgical risk to, language function. This study examined the effect of sex on the activation and functional connectivity of the brain, measured with presurgical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) language mapping in patients with a brain tumor. We carried out a retrospective analysis of data from neurosurgical patients treated at our institution who met the criteria of pathological diagnosis (malignant brain tumor), tumor location (left hemisphere), and fMRI paradigms [sentence completion (SC); antonym generation (AG); and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)]. Forty-seven patients (22 females, mean age = 56.0 years) were included in the study. Across the SC and AG tasks, females relative to males showed greater activation in limited areas, including the left inferior frontal gyrus classically associated with language. In contrast, males relative to females showed greater activation in extended areas beyond the classic language network, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and precentral gyrus. The rs-fMRI functional connectivity of the left SMA in the females was stronger with inferior temporal pole (TP) areas, and in the males with several midline areas. The findings are overall consistent with theories of greater reliance on specialized language areas in females relative to males, and generalized brain areas in males relative to females, for language function. Importantly, the findings suggest that sex could affect fMRI language mapping. Thus, considering sex as a variable in presurgical language mapping merits further investigation.

However, the fMRI signal may be contaminated by subject motion artifacts that are only partially mitigated by motion correction strategies. These artifacts lead to distance-dependent biases in the inferred signal correlations. To mitigate these spurious effects, motion-corrupted volumes are censored from fMRI time series. Censoring can result in discontinuities in the fMRI signal, which may lead to substantial alterations in functional connectivity analysis. We propose a new approach to recover the missing entries from censoring based on structured low rank matrix completion. We formulated the artifact-reduction problem as the recovery of a super-resolved matrix from unprocessed fMRI measurements. We enforced a low rank prior on a large structured matrix, formed from the samples of the time series, to recover the missing entries. The recovered time series, in addition to being motion compensated, are also slice-time corrected at a fine temporal resolution. To achieve a fast and memory-efficient solution for our proposed optimization problem, we employed a variable splitting strategy. We validated the algorithm with simulations, data acquired under different motion conditions, and datasets from the ABCD study. Functional connectivity analysis showed that the proposed reconstruction resulted in connectivity matrices with lower errors in pair-wise correlation than non-censored and censored time series based on a standard processing pipeline. In addition, seed-based correlation analyses showed improved delineation of the default mode network. These demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce the adverse effects of motion in fMRI analysis.

Independent component analysis (ICA) has been applied in estimating FNs from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, determining an optimal model order for ICA remains challenging, leading to criticism about the reliability of FN estimation. Here, we propose a SMART (splitting-merging assisted reliable) ICA method that automatically extracts reliable FNs by clustering independent components (ICs) obtained from multi-model-order ICA using a simplified graph while providing linkages among FNs deduced from different-model orders. We extend SMART ICA to multi-subject fMRI analysis, validating its effectiveness using simulated and real fMRI data. Based on simulated data, the method accurately estimates both group-common and group-unique components and demonstrates robustness to parameters. Using two age-matched cohorts of resting fMRI data comprising 1,950 healthy subjects, the resulting reliable group-level FNs are greatly similar between the two cohorts, and interestingly the subject-specific FNs show progressive changes while age increases. Furthermore, both small-scale and large-scale brain FN templates are provided as benchmarks for future studies. Taken together, SMART ICA can automatically obtain reliable FNs in analyzing multi-subject fMRI data, while also providing linkages between different FNs.

In monkey fMRI, to restrain head movements, researchers usually surgically implant a plastic head-post on the skull. Although time-proven to be effective, this technique could create burdens for animals, including a risk of infection and discomfort. Furthermore, the presence of extraneous objects on the skull, such as bone screws and dental cement, adversely affects signals near the cortical surface. These side effects are undesirable in terms of both the practical aspect of efficient data collection and the spirit of "refinement" from the 3R's. Here, we demonstrate that a completely non-invasive fMRI scan in awake monkeys is possible by using a plastic head mask made to fit the skull of individual animals. In all of the three monkeys tested, longitudinal, quantitative assessment of head movements showed that the plastic mask has effectively suppressed head movements, and we were able to obtain reliable retinotopic BOLD signals in a standard retinotopic mapping task. The present, easy-to-make plastic mask has a strong potential to simplify fMRI experiments in awake monkeys, while giving data that is as good as or even better quality than that obtained with the conventional head-post method.

However, it remains unclear whether these right-hemispheric patterns of activity are critical for language, which is highly relevant for clinical preoperative language mapping. The available findings are controversial. In this study, we first measured individual patterns of language lateralization with an fMRI language localizer in healthy participants with different handedness (N = 31). Then, the same participants received rTMS over the individual coordinates of peak fMRI-based activation in the left and right inferior frontal gyri. During rTMS, participants performed a picture naming task. It included both objects and actions to test whether naming of nouns and verbs would be equally modulated by rTMS. Stimulation of the left inferior frontal gyrus resulted in accuracy facilitation of verb production regardless of individual language lateralization. No modulation of object naming was found at any stimulation site in terms of accuracy nor reaction time. This study causally confirmed the critical contribution of the left, but not the right hemisphere to verb production regardless of the language lateralization patterns observed with fMRI. Also, the results stress that action rather than object naming is the task of choice for mapping language in the frontal lobe.

In this paper, a multi-subjects adaptive region growing method (MARGM) is proposed for the group fMRI analysis, where initial seed-region of multi-subjects is automatically determined by combining the split-merge based seed-region selection method with a prior template. Next, an improved homogeneity criterion is defined to control region growing, and an adaptive threshold is introduced to accelerate the convergence process of region growing. Finally, reproducible coefficients are used to obtain spatial information at the group level by considering temporal information simultaneously. The experimental results of hybrid-data and real fMRI data showed that MARGM could generate effective and reliable results compared to the classical fMRI data analysis methods including group independent component analysis and statistical parametric mapping. It could be used to obtain more representative information at the group level, which reflected the commonalities of the subjects in the group. Therefore, it is expected to have wide applicability for the fMRI data analysis.

In non-human primates (NHP), contrast enhancement is possible using monocrystalline iron-oxide nanoparticles (MION) contrast agent, which has a more temporally extended response function. However, using BOLD fMRI in NHP is desirable for interspecies comparison, and the BOLD signal's faster response function promises to be beneficial for rapid event-related (rER) designs. Here, we used rER BOLD fMRI in macaque monkeys while viewing real-world images, and found visual responses and category selectivity consistent with previous studies. However, activity estimates were very noisy, suggesting that the lower contrast-to-noise ratio of BOLD, suboptimal behavioural performance, and motion artefacts, in combination, render rER BOLD fMRI challenging in NHP. Previous studies have shown that rER fMRI is possible in macaques with MION, despite MION's prolonged response function. To understand this, we conducted simulations of the BOLD and MION response during rER, and found that no matter how fast the design, the greater amplitude of the MION response outweighs the contrast loss caused by greater temporal smoothing. We conclude that although any two of the three elements (rER, BOLD, NHP) have been shown to work well, the combination of all three is particularly challenging.

However, because of their complexity, the fundamental mechanisms underlying time-varying functional networks are still not well under-stood. Here, we develop a novel nonlinear feature extraction framework called local space-contrastive learning (LSCL), which extracts distinctive nonlinear temporal structure hidden in time series, by training a deep temporal convolutional neural network in an unsupervised, data-driven manner. We demonstrate that LSCL identifies certain distinctive local temporal structures, referred to as temporal primitives, which repeatedly appear at different time points and spatial locations, reflecting dynamic resting-state networks. We also show that these temporal primitives are also present in task-evoked spatiotemporal responses. We further show that the temporal primitives capture unique aspects of behavioral traits such as fluid intelligence and working memory. These re-sults highlight the importance of capturing transient spatiotemporal dynamics within fMRI data and suggest that such temporal primitives may capture fundamental information underlying both spontaneous and task-induced fMRI dynamics.

Simultaneous Data Collection of fMRI and fNIRS Measurements Using a Whole-Head Optode Array and Short-Distance Channels	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; NIRS-FMRI; BRAIN; BOLD	Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable neuroimaging methodology, more robust to motion and more cost-effective than functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which makes it highly suitable for conducting naturalistic studies of brain function and for use with developmental and clinical populations. Both fNIRS and fMRI methodologies detect changes in cerebral blood oxygenation during functional brain activation, and prior studies have shown high spatial and temporal correspondence between the two signals. There is, however, no quantitative comparison of the two signals collected simultaneously from the same subjects with whole-head fNIRS coverage. This comparison is necessary to comprehensively validate area-level activations and functional connectivity against the fMRI gold standard, which in turn has the potential to facilitate comparisons of the two signals across the lifespan. We address this gap by describing a protocol for simultaneous data collection of fMRI and fNIRS signals that: i) provides whole-head fNIRS coverage; ii) includes short-distance measurements for regression of the non-cortical, systemic physiological signal; and iii) implements two different methods for optodeto-scalp co-registration of fNIRS measurements. fMRI and fNIRS data from three subjects are presented, and recommendations for adapting the protocol to test developmental and clinical populations are discussed. The current setup with adults allows scanning sessions for an average of approximately 40 min, which includes both functional and structural scans. The protocol outlines the steps required to adapt the fNIRS equipment for use in the magnetic resonance (MR) environment, provides recommendations for both data recording and optode-to-scalp co-registration, and discusses potential modifications of the protocol to fit the specifics of the available MR-safe fNIRS system. Representative subject-specific responses from a flashing checkerboard task illustrate the feasibility of the protocol to measure whole-head fNIRS signals in the MR environment. This protocol will be particularly relevant for researchers interested in validating fNIRS signals against fMRI across the lifespan.

J	Wang, N; Yao, DR; Ma, LZ; Liu, MX				Wang, Nan; Yao, Dongren; Ma, Lizhuang; Liu, Mingxia			Multi-site clustering and nested feature extraction for identifying autism spectrum disorder with resting-state fMRI	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Functional connectivity; fMRI; Discriminative biomarker identification	BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; MODEL	Brain functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely employed to study neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Existing studies usually suffer from (1) significant data heterogeneity caused by different scanners or studied populations in multiple sites, (2) curse of dimensionality caused by millions of voxels in each fMRI scan and a very limited number (tens or hundreds) of training samples, and (3) poor interpretability, which hinders the identification of reproducible disease biomarkers. To this end, we propose a Multi-site Clustering and Nested Feature Extraction (MC-NFE) method for fMRI-based ASD detection. Specifically, we first divide multi-site training data into ASD and healthy control (HC) groups. To model inter-site hetero-geneity within each category, we use a similarity-driven multiview linear reconstruction model to learn latent representations and perform subject clustering within each group. We then design a nested sin-gular value decomposition (SVD) method to mitigate inter-site heterogeneity and extract FC features by learning both local cluster-shared features across sites within each category and global category-shared features across ASD and HC groups, followed by a linear support vector machine (SVM) for ASD detection. Experimental results on 609 subjects with rs-fMRI from the ABIDE database with 21 imaging sites sug-gest that the proposed MC-NFE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in ASD detection. The most discriminative FCs identified by the MC-NFE are mainly located in default mode network, salience network, and cerebellum region , which could be used as potential biomarkers for fMRI-based ASD analysis.

However, the contribution of inhibitory neurons to BOLD fMRI is unclear. Here, the role of inhibitory and excitatory activity was examined using multimodal approaches: electrophysiological recording, 15.2 T fMRI, optical intrinsic signal imaging, and modeling. Inhibitory and excitatory neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex were selectively modulated by 20-s optogenetic stimulation of VGAT-ChR2 and CaMKII-ChR2 mice, respectively. Somatosensory stimulation and optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons induced positive BOLD responses in the somatosensory network, whereas stimulation of inhibitory neurons produced biphasic responses at the stimulation site, initial positive and later negative BOLD signals, and negative BOLD responses at downstream sites. When the stimulation duration was reduced to 5 s, the hemodynamic response of VGAT-ChR2 mice to optogenetic stimulation was only positive. Lastly, modeling performed from neuronal and hemodynamic data shows that the hemodynamic response function (HRF) of excitatory neurons is similar across different conditions, whereas the HRF of inhibitory neurons is highly sensitive to stimulation frequency and peaks earlier than that of excitatory neurons. Our study provides insights into the neurovascular coupling of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the interpretation of BOLD fMRI signals.

Existing studies have focused on fMRI-based recognition models to help diagnose brain disorders. However, due to the high cost of fMRI data acquisition and labeling, the amount of fMRI data is usually small, which largely limits the performance of recognition models. In addition, cross-site classification is always a challenge in fMRI studies, because the heterogeneity of data collection at different sites increases the complexity and diversity of the data distribution, making the cross-site classification less robust than site-specific classification. In this article, we propose three data augmentation methods based on functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of fMRI data, aided by a deep feature fusion method, for automatic disease identification. First, the Gaussian noise method, Mixup method, and sliding window method are proposed to effectively augment FCN data, as these can balance the variability of the sample distribution. Second, the convolution neural network and graph attention network (GAT) are separately employed to extract local and global features from FCNs. Finally, the two kinds of features are integrated to classify subjects. The experimental results on the attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-200 dataset indicate that: 1) the data augmentation methods can effectively improve identification performance, in particular, the sliding window method performs best; 2) the cross-site ADHD classification is improved by combining the data augmentation method of sliding window and deep feature fusion method; and 3) the rationality of data augmentation for FCNs is explained by visualizing the hidden fused features with t-stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) algorithm.

Insight into the rapidly developing brain in utero is limited, and fetal fMRI can be used to gain a greater understanding of the developmental process. Fetal brain fMRI is typically limited to resting-state fMRI due to the difficulty to instruct or provide a stimulus to the fetus. Previous studies have employed auditory task fMRI with an external sound stimulus directly on the abdomen of the mother; however, this practice has since been deemed unsafe for the developing fetus. Purpose To investigate a reliable and safe paradigm to study the development of fetal brain networks, we postulated that an internal task, such as the mother's singing, as the auditory stimulus would result in activation in the fetal primary auditory cortex. Study type Cohort. Population Pregnant women with singleton pregnancies (n = 9; 33-38 weeks gestational age). Field Strength/Sequence All subjects underwent two task-based block design blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) at 1.5T or 3T. Assessment Each volume was assessed for fetal motion and manually reoriented and realigned to correct for fetal motion. Once the motion was corrected, a gestational age-matched parcellated atlas with regions of interest overlaid onto the activation map was used to determine which regions in the brain had activation during task phases. Statistical Tests First Level Analysis. MRI data were analyzed using SPM 12 as a task fMRI. Results Eight subjects had activation on the right Heschl's gyrus; six fetuses demonstrated activation on the left when exposed to the internal acoustic stimulus. Additionally, activation was found on the right and left middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and the left putamen. Data Conclusion Maternal singing can be used as an internal stimulus to activate the auditory network and Heschl's gyrus during fetal fMRI.

However, the comparability of these approaches at the level of large-scale functional networks has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, 44 subjects were randomly assigned to receive sham (N = 15), tDCS (N = 15), or tACS (N = 14). The first electrode (anode in tDCS) was positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the target area, and the second electrode (cathode in tDCS) was placed over the right supraorbital region. tDCS was delivered with a constant current of 2 mA. tACS was fixed to 2 mA peak-to-peak with 6 Hz frequency. Stimulation was applied concurrently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, both at rest and during the performance of a verbal working memory (WM) task. After stimulation, subjects repeated the fMRI WM task. Our results indicated that at rest, tDCS increased functional connectivity particularly within the default-mode network (DMN), while tACS decreased it. When comparing both fMRI WM tasks, it was observed that tDCS displayed decreased brain activity post-stimulation as compared to online. Conversely, tACS effects were driven by neural increases online as compared to post-stimulation. Interestingly, both effects primarily occurred within DMN-related areas. Regarding the differences in each fMRI WM task, during the online fMRI WM task, tACS engaged distributed neural resources which did not overlap with the WM-dependent activity pattern, but with some posterior DMN regions. In contrast, during the post-stimulation fMRI WM task, tDCS strengthened prefrontal DMN deactivations, being these activity reductions associated with faster responses. Furthermore, it was observed that tDCS neural responses presented certain consistency across distinct fMRI modalities, while tACS did not. In sum, tDCS and tACS modulate fMRI-derived network dynamics differently. However, both effects seem to focus on DMN regions and the WM network-DMN shift, which are highly affected in aging and disease. Thus, albeit exploratory and needing further replication with larger samples, our results might provide a refined understanding of how the DMN functioning can be externally modulated through commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which may be of eventual clinical relevance.

Face selective regions on the ventral temporal cortex have been localized with electrical cortical stimulation (ECS), electrocorticography (ECoG), and functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI). This is the first group study using within-patient comparisons to validate face selective regions mapping, utilizing the aforementioned modalities. Five patients underwent surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy and joined the study. Subdural grid electrodes were implanted on their ventral temporal cortices to localize seizure foci and face selective regions as part of the functional mapping protocol. Face selective regions were identified in all patients with fMRI, four patients with ECoG, and two patients with ECS. From 177 tested electrode locations in the region of interest (ROI), which is defined by the fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus, 54 face locations were identified by at least one modality in all patients. fMRI mapping showed the highest detection rate, revealing 70.4% for face selective locations, whereas ECoG and ECS identified 64.8 and 31.5%, respectively. Thus, 28 face locations were co-localized by at least two modalities, with detection rates of 89.3% for fMRI, 85.7% for ECoG and 53.6 % for ECS. All five patients had no face recognition deficits after surgery, even though five of the face selective locations, one obtained by ECoG and the other four by fMRI, were within 10 mm to the resected volumes. Moreover, fMRI included a quite large volume artifact on the ventral temporal cortex in the ROI from the anatomical structures of the temporal base. In conclusion, ECS was not sensitive in several patients, whereas ECoG and fMRI even showed activation within 10 mm to the resected volumes. Considering the potential signal drop-out in fMRI makes ECoG the most reliable tool to identify face selective locations in this study. A multimodal approach can improve the specificity of ECoG and fMRI, while simultaneously minimizing the number of required ECS sessions. Hence, all modalities should be considered in a clinical mapping protocol entailing combined results of co-localized face selective locations.

The cluster-level statistic is often obtained by counting the number of intra-cluster voxels which surpass a voxel-level statistical significance threshold. This measure can be sub-optimal regarding the power and false-positive error rate because the suprathreshold voxel count neglects the voxel-wise significance levels and ignores the dependence between voxels. This article aims to provide a new Integrated Cluster-wise significance Measure (ICM) for cluster-level significance determination in cluster-wise fMRI analysis by integrating cluster extent, voxel-level significance (e.g., p values), and activation dependence between within-cluster voxels. We develop a computationally efficient strategy for ICM based on probabilistic approximation theories. Consequently, the computational load for ICM-based cluster-wise inference (e.g., permutation tests) is affordable. We validate the proposed method via extensive simulations and then apply it to two fMRI data sets. The results demonstrate that ICM can improve the power with well-controlled family-wise error (FWE).

Central to the utility of EEG-fMRI neuroimaging systems are the methods for fusing the two data streams, with machine learning playing a key role. These methods can be dichotomized into those that are symmetric and asymmetric in terms of how the two modalities inform the fusion. Studies using these methods have shown that fusion yields new insights into brain function that are not possible when each modality is acquired separately. As technology improves and methods for fusion become more sophisticated, the future of EEG-fMRI for noninvasive measurement of brain dynamics includes mesoscale mapping at ultrahigh magnetic resonance fields, targeted perturbation-based neuroimaging, and using deep learning to uncover nonlinear representations that link the electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements.

Learning-based methods typically rely on functional connectivity networks (FCNs) derived from blood-oxygen-level-dependent time series of rs-fMRI data to capture interactions between brain regions-of-interest (ROIs). Graph neural networks have been recently used to extract fMRI features from graph-structured FCNs, but cannot effectively characterize spatiotemporal dynamics of FCNs, e.g., the functional connectivity of brain ROIs is dynamically changing in a short period of time. Also, many studies usually focus on single-scale topology of FCN, thereby ignoring the potential complementary topological information of FCN at different spatial resolutions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale dynamic graph learning (MDGL) framework to capture multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamic representations of rs-fMRI data for automated brain disorder diagnosis. The MDGL framework consists of three major components: 1) multi-scale dynamic FCN construction using multiple brain atlases to model multi-scale topological information, 2) multi-scale dynamic graph representation learning to capture spatiotemporal information conveyed in fMRI data, and 3) multi-scale feature fusion and classification. Experimental results on two datasets show that MDGL outperforms several stateof-the-art methods.

Here, we estimated the correlation between human transcriptome data and two different brain activation maps measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects. Whole-brain activation patterns evoked during an emotional face recognition task were associated with topological mRNA expression of genes involved in cellular transport. In contrast, fMRI activation patterns related to the acceptance of monetary rewards were associated with genes implicated in cellular localization processes, metabolism, translation, and synapse regulation. An overlap of these genes with risk genes from major depressive disorder genome-wide association studies revealed the involvement of the master regulators TCF4 and PAX6 in emotion and reward processing. Overall, the identification of stable relationships between spatial gene expression profiles and fMRI data may reshape the prospects for imaging transcriptomics studies.

This study aims to establish the fundamental organization between somatosensory and insular cortices in routing nociceptive information. By employing an integrated multimodal approach of high-field fMRI, intracranial electrophysiology, and transsynaptic viral tracing in rats, we observed a hierarchically organized connection of S1/S2 -> posterior insula -> anterior insula in routing nociceptive information. The directional nociceptive pathway determined by early fMRI responses was consistent with that examined by early evoked LFP, intrinsic effective connectivity, and anatomical projection, suggesting fMRI could provide a valuable facility to discern directional neural circuits in animals and humans non-invasively. Moreover, our knowledge of the nociceptive hierarchical organization of somatosensory and insular cortices and the interface role of the posterior insula may have implications for the development of targeted pain therapies.

In this report, we demonstrate that multi-echo fMRI can improve the reliability of FC-based measurements. In four densely sampled individual humans, just 10 min of multi-echo data yielded better test-retest reliability than 30 min of single-echo data in independent datasets. This effect is pronounced in clinically important brain regions, including the subgenual cingulate, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, and is linked to three biophysical signal mechanisms (thermal noise, regional vari ability in the rate of T-2* decay, and S-0-dependent artifacts) with spatially distinct influences. Together, these findings establish the potential utility of multi-echo fMRI for rapid precision mapping using experimentally and clinically tractable scan times and will facilitate longitudinal neuroimaging of clinical populations.

Here we discuss a relatively new method-hyperscanning-to study real-time, interactive social interactions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We highlight three contributions that fMRI hyperscanning makes to the study of the social mind: (1) Naturalism: it shifts the focus from tightly-controlled stimuli to more naturalistic social interactions; (2) Multi-person Dynamics: it shifts the focus from individuals as the unit of analysis to dyads and groups; and (3) Neural Resolution: fMRI hyperscanning captures high-resolution neural patterns and dynamics across the whole brain, unlike other neuroimaging hyperscanning methods (e.g., electroencephalogram, functional near-infrared spectroscopy). Finally, we describe the practical considerations and challenges that fMRI hyperscanning researchers must navigate. We hope researchers will harness this powerful new paradigm to address pressing questions in today's society.

However, to take advantage of this multimodal technique, some technical issues need to be considered/addressed. In this work, we evaluated technical issues associated with the setup and utilization of this multimodal tool, such as the use of a large single-channel radio frequency (rf) coil, and the artifacts induced by TMS when interleaved with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. We demonstrated that good image quality can be achieved with this rf coil and that the adoption of axial imaging orientation in conjunction with a safe interval of 100 ms, between the TMS pulse and imaging acquisition, is a suitable combination to eliminate potential image artifacts when using the combined TMS-fMRI technique in 3-T MRI scanners.

Frequency drift in MR spectroscopy at 3T	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); Frequency drift; 3T; Press; Multi-vendor; Multi-site	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; GABA; ARTIFACTS; NAVIGATOR; BRAIN; PHASE; WATER	Purpose: Heating of gradient coils and passive shim components is a common cause of instability in the B-0 field, especially when gradient intensive sequences are used. The aim of the study was to set a benchmark for typical drift encountered during MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess the need for real-time field-frequency locking on MRI scanners by comparing field drift data from a large number of sites. Method: A standardized protocol was developed for 80 participating sites using 99 3T MR scanners from 3 major vendors. Phantom water signals were acquired before and after an EPI sequence. The protocol consisted of: minimal preparatory imaging; a short pre-fMRI PRESS; a ten-minute fMRI acquisition; and a long post-fMRI PRESS acquisition. Both pre- and post-fMRI PRESS were non-water suppressed. Real-time frequency stabilization/adjustment was switched off when appropriate. Sixty scanners repeated the protocol for a second dataset. In addition, a three-hour post-fMRI MRS acquisition was performed at one site to observe change of gradient temperature and drift rate. Spectral analysis was performed using MATLAB. Frequency drift in pre-fMRI PRESS data were compared with the first 5:20 minutes and the full 30:00 minutes of data after fMRI. Median (interquartile range) drifts were measured and showed in violin plot. Paired t-tests were performed to compare frequency drift pre- and post-fMRI. A simulated in vivo spectrum was generated using FID-A to visualize the effect of the observed frequency drifts. The simulated spectrum was convolved with the frequency trace for the most extreme cases. Impacts of frequency drifts on NAA and GABA were also simulated as a function of linear drift. Data from the repeated protocol were compared with the corresponding first dataset using Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: Of the data collected from 99 scanners, 4 were excluded due to various reasons. Thus, data from 95 scanners were ultimately analyzed. For the first 5:20 min (64 transients), median (interquartile range) drift was 0.44 (1.29) Hz before fMRI and 0.83 (1.29) Hz after. This increased to 3.15 (4.02) Hz for the full 30 min (360 transients) run. Average drift rates were 0.29 Hz/min before fMRI and 0.43 Hz/min after. Paired t-tests indicated that drift increased after fMRI, as expected (p < 0.05). Simulated spectra convolved with the frequency drift showed that the intensity of the NAA singlet was reduced by up to 26%, 44 % and 18% for GE, Philips and Siemens scanners after fMRI, respectively. ICCs indicated good agreement between datasets acquired on separate days. The single site long acquisition showed drift rate was reduced to 0.03 Hz/min approximately three hours after fMRI. Discussion: This study analyzed frequency drift data from 95 3T MRI scanners. Median levels of drift were relatively low (5-min average under 1 Hz), but the most extreme cases suffered from higher levels of drift. The extent of drift varied across scanners which both linear and nonlinear drifts were observed.	[Hui, Steve C.

Despite the extensive use of brain imaging, spinal cord imaging has received relatively less attention, regardless of its potential to study peripheral communications with the brain and the descending corticospinal systems. To comprehensively understand the neural mechanisms underlying human sensory and motor functions, particularly in pathological conditions, simultaneous examination of neuronal activity in both the brain and spinal cord becomes imperative. Although technically demanding in terms of data acquisition and analysis, a growing but limited number of studies have successfully utilized specialized acquisition protocols for corticospinal imaging. These studies have effectively assessed sensorimotor, autonomic, and interneuronal signaling within the spinal cord, revealing interactions with cortical processes in the brain. In this mini-review, we aim to examine the expanding body of literature that employs cutting-edge corticospinal imaging to investigate the flow of sensorimotor information between the brain and spinal cord. Additionally, we will provide a concise overview of recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Furthermore, we will discuss potential future perspectives aimed at enhancing our comprehension of large-scale neuronal networks in the CNS and their disruptions in clinical disorders. This collective knowledge will aid in refining combined corticospinal fMRI methodologies, leading to the development of clinically relevant biomarkers for conditions affecting sensorimotor processing in the CNS.

However, self-regulation processes engaged during fMRI-nf are incompletely understood. Here, we used matched feedback in an fMRI-nf experimental protocol to investigate whether brain processes recognize true neurofeedback signals. Methods: We implemented an existing fMRI-nf protocol to train lateralized motor activity using a finger-tap task in conjunction with real-time feedback. Twelve healthy, right-handed, adult participants were assigned into age- and sex-matched active and sham study groups. Matched participant pairs received the same visual feedback, based on brain activity of the participant from the active group. We compared group-averaged activation maps before, during, and after neurofeedback, and analyzed changes in lateralized motor activity due to neurofeedback. Results: Active and sham groups demonstrated different brain activation to the same feedback during neurofeedback. In particular, there was higher activation in visual cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, and right inferior frontal gyrus in the active group compared to the sham group. Conversely, sham participants demonstrated higher activation in anterior cingulate cortex, left frontal pole, and posterior superior temporal gyrus. Despite differing brain activations during neurofeedback, neither group demonstrated significant improvement in lateralized motor activity from pre to postfeedback scan in the same session. We also observed no significant difference between pre and postfeedback activation maps, suggesting that no significant finger-tap related functional reorganization had occurred. Conclusions: These findings suggest that fMRI neurofeedback paradigms that monitor or incorporate activity from regions reported here would provide enhanced efficacy for research investigation and clinical intervention.

We examined the effect of real-time fMRI based neurofeedback training on visuo-spatial memory and its associated neuronal response. Twelve healthy subjects and nine patients of prodromal Alzheimer's disease were included. The examination spanned five days (T1-T5): T1 contained a neuropsychological pre-test, the encoding of an itinerary and a fMRI-based task related that itinerary. T2-T4 hosted the real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of the parahippocampal gyrus and on T5 a post-test session including encoding of another itinerary and a subsequent fMRIbased task were done. Scores from neuropsychological tests, brain activation and task performance during the fMRI-paradigm were compared between pre and post-test as well as between healthy controls and patients. Behavioural performance in the fMRI-task remained unchanged, while cognitive testing showed improvements in visuo-spatial memory performance. Both groups displayed task-relevant brain activation, which decreased in the right precentral gyrus and left occipital lobe from pre to post-test in controls, but increased in the right occipital lobe, middle frontal gyrus and left frontal lobe in the patient group. While results suggest that the training has affected brain activation differently between controls and patients, there are no pointers towards a behavioural manifestation of these changes. Future research is required on the effects that can be induced using real-time fMRI based neurofeedback training and the required training duration to elicit broad and lasting effects.

The temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) can cause neural-inflammation in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) at the site of injury, or compression, and may have systemic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Neural-inflammation causes elevations in cytokine expression and microglia activation. When the site of injury, or compression is treated, or relieved, neural inflammation is reduced. These changes can be seen and measured with fMRI brain activities. Methods For this study, patients with comorbid TMD and systemic/neurologic conditions were compared using clinical diagnostic markers, inflammatory, pain, tissue destruction enzymatic biomarkers, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity of the brain, with and without a custom-made dental orthotic. Results Our results showed a correlation between the clinical diagnosis of the pathological TMJ, biomarkers and the fMRI study. There was a marked elevation of biomarkers in samples taken from TMJ of patients who were clinically diagnosed with TMD. The fMRI study of TMD patients showed an abnormal hyper-connected salience network and a diminished blood flow to the anterior frontal lobes when they did not wear their customized dental orthotics. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of TMJ-CNS connections and use of fMRI as an investigative tool for understanding TMD and its related neurological pathologies.

J	Rashid, M; Singh, H; Goyal, V				Rashid, Mamoon; Singh, Harjeet; Goyal, Vishal			FFTPSOGA: Fast Fourier Transform with particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm approach for pattern identification of brain responses in multi subject fMRI data	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Feature extraction; fMRI; Brain images; Fourier transform; Pattern identification; Neural activity; Voxel; Regions of interest	FEATURE-SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; RECOGNITION; MODEL	Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is the popular technique where it is possible to capture neural activity in brain regions when subjected to different stimuli. However, due to fMRI datasets' high dimensional and sparse nature, the best features' selection plays an essential role in providing the best classification accuracy in fMRI models. This paper selects the stable feature set from the fMRI dataset using hybrid Fast Fourier Transform with Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm (FFTPSOGA). Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used on the extracted features by PSO-GA to convert the magnitude of features into phase values for better performance. Next, the machine learning algorithms of GaussianNB, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGboost has been trained based on these extracted features of six subjects of the dataset. The experimental analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm resulted in optimum features that helped extract informative Regions of Interest (ROI) with better classification accuracy. Our implemented algorithm FFTPSOGA extracted the best voxels in six subjects of the dataset by selecting minimum ROIs with a model classification accuracy of 0.98, 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.96 for the SVM classifier. Comparison of the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art techniques show that our algorithm resulted in best voxels and outperformed work in [1, 9, 25] by achieving higher accuracy of 98% and low computational costs with only 127 number of features. Due to its better performance, we believe that it can be used for the pattern identification of brain responses in multi-subject fMRI data.

Not a Slam-Dunk: Assessing the Role of EEG/fMRI in the Presurgical Evaluation	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material						EEG-fMRI; bold; epilepsy surgery; outcomes; multimodality imaging		Objective: To assess the utility of EEG-fMRI for epilepsy surgery, we evaluated surgical outcome in relation to the resection of the most significant EEG-fMRI response. Methods: Patients with post-operative neuroimaging and follow-up of at least 1 year were included. In EEG-fMRI responses, we defined as "primary" the cluster with the highest absolute t-value located in the cortex, and evaluated three levels of confidence for the results. The threshold for low confidence was t >= 3.1 (P <.005); the one for medium confidence corresponded to correction for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of .05; and a result reached high confidence when the primary cluster was much more significant than the next highest cluster. Concordance with the resection was determined by comparison to post-operative neuroimaging. Results: We evaluated 106 epilepsy surgeries in 84 patients. An increasing association between concordance and surgical outcome with higher levels of confidence was demonstrated. If the peak response was not resected, the surgical outcome was likely to be poor: for the high confidence level, no patient had a good outcome; for the medium and low levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome. The positive predictive value remained low for all confidence levels, indicating that removing the maximum cluster did not ensure seizure freedom. Conclusion: Resection of the primary EEG-fMRI cluster, especially in high confidence cases, is necessary to obtain a good outcome, but not sufficient. Classification of Evidence: This study provided Class II evidence that failure to resect the primary EEG-fMRI cluster is associated with poorer epilepsy surgery outcomes.

Phase fMRI defines brain resting-state functional hubs within central and posterior regions	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Phase fMRI; Brain functional connectivity (FC); Independent component analysis (ICA); Network graph; Eigencentrality; Hubness	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; DEFAULT MODE; BOLD FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; MAGNITUDE; CLUSTERS	From a brain functional connectivity (FC) matrix, we can identify the hub nodes by a new method of eigencentrality mapping, which not only counts for one node's centrality but also all other nodes' centrality values through correlation connections in an eigenvector of the FC matrix. For the resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data (complex-valued EPI images in nature), both magnitude and phase images are useful for brain FC analysis. We herein report on brain functional hubness analysis by constructing the FC matrix from phase fMRI data and identifying the hub nodes by eigencentrality mapping. In our study, we collected a cohort of 160 complex-valued fMRI dataset (consisting of magnitude and phase in pairs), and performed independent component analysis (ICA), FC matrix calculation (in size of 50 x 50) and FC matrix eigen decomposition; thereby obtained the 50-node eigencentrality values in the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue. We also compared the hub structures inferred from FC matrices under different thresholding. Alternatively, we obtained the geometric hubs among p value the 50 nodes involved in the FC matrix through the use of harmonic centrality metric. Our results showed that phase fMRI data analysis defines the resting-state brain functional hubs primarily in the central region (subcortex) and the posterior region (parieto-occipital lobes and cerebella). The brain central hubness was supported by the geometric central hubness, which, however, is distinct from the magnitude-inferred hubness in brain superior region (frontal and parietal lobes). Our findings pose a new understanding of (or a debate over) brain functional connectivity architecture.

This study aimed to promote the performance of RS-fMRI-based individualized predictive models by introducing effective feature extraction and utilization strategies and making better use of information hidden in RS-fMRI data. We proposed a novel framework named multi-facet BrainNet with connectivity attention (MFBCA) to fulfill the purpose, and the framework is characterized by the following three strategies. First, in addition to the overwhelmingly popular functional connectivity, we also used distance correlation and weighted directed connectivity as multi-facet inputs for MFBCA. Second, a connectivity attention layer was proposed to force MFBCA to focus more on connections that are important for predictions. Finally, a BrainNet-based architecture with a feature fusion module was introduced to facilitate final predictions. We evaluated the performance of MFBCA with predictions of individuals' age and intelligence quotient as test cases based on three public RS-fMRI datasets. The results indicate that MFBCA can effectively utilize the information hidden in RS-fMRI data and outperform baselines. The predicted-vs-actual correlations for age predictions were 0.876 (7.314 years), 0.873 (8.121 years), and 0.681 (3.865 years), and for IQ predictions was 0.615 (4.287). The connectivity attention layer made it possible for us to determine the connections important for individualized predictions. MFBCA can be widely applied to predictions based on neuroimaging data from which connectivity maps can be extracted. Furthermore, the explicit physiological basis for predictions provided by the connectivity attention layer makes MFBCA a profitable choice for clinical applications.

Individual intelligence scores were previously predicted from whole-brain connectivity patterns, extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired at rest. Recently, it was shown that task-induced brain activation maps outperform these resting-state connectivity patterns in predicting individual intelligence, suggesting that a cognitively demanding environment improves prediction of cognitive abilities. Here, we use data from the Human Connectome Project to predict task-induced brain activation maps from resting-state fMRI, and proceed to use these predicted activity maps to further predict individual differences in a variety of traits. While models based on original task activation maps remain the most accurate, models based on predicted maps significantly outperformed those based on the resting-state connectome. Thus, we provide a promising approach for the evaluation of measures of human behavior from brain activation maps, that could be used without having participants actually perform the tasks.

A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation as Stand-Alone Treatment for Post-Stroke Aphasia: Effects on Language and Verbal Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)	MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR			English	Article						Aphasia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Stroke; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation	CONSTRAINT-INDUCED APHASIA; SELF-GENERATION; THERAPY; STROKE; IMPROVEMENTS; FEASIBILITY; FRAMEWORK; SPEECH; BRAIN	Background: There is an ongoing need for facilitating language recovery in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The primary aim of this study (NCT01512264) was to examine if noninvasive intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) applied to the injured left-hemispheric cortex promotes language improvements and fMRI changes in post-stroke aphasia. Material/Methods: Participants were randomized to 3 weeks of sham (Tx0) or 1-3 weeks of iTBS (Tx123). We assessed participants who completed the first 2 functional MRI (fMRI) sessions (T1, T2) where they performed 2 overt language fMRI tasks, and examined longitudinal response after 3 months (T3). Language performance and fMRI activation changes, and relationships between these changes were assessed. Results: From T1 to T2, both groups showed improvements on the Boston Naming Test (BNT). From T1 to T3, Tx123 improved on the Aphasia Quotient, post-scan word recognition on the verbal paired associates task (VPAT), and perceived communicative ability. Each group exhibited significant activation changes between T1 and T2 for both tasks. Only the Tx123 group exhibited fMRI activation changes between T2 to T3 on the verb-generation task and between T1 and T3 on VPAT. Delayed aphasia symptom improvement for Tx123 was associated with increased left ventral visual stream activation from T1 to T3 (rho=0.74, P=0.0058), and with decreased bilateral supplementary motor area activation related to VPAT encoding from T2 to T3 (rho=-0.80, P=0.0016). Conclusions: Observed iTBS-induced language improvements and associations between delayed fMRI changes and aphasia improvements support the therapeutic and neurorehabilitative potential of iTBS in post-stroke aphasia recovery.

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have attempted to overcome the limitations of temporal resolution to investigate dynamic states of brain activity. However, finding an fMRI method with sufficient temporal resolution to keep up with the progress of neuronal signals in the brain is challenging. This study aimed to detect between-hemisphere signal progression, occurring on a timescale of tens of milliseconds, in the ventral brain regions involved in face processing. To this end, we devised an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) stimulation scheme and used a 7T MRI system to obtain fMRI signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We conducted two experiments: one to measure signal suppression depending on the ISI and another to measure the relationship between the amount of suppression and the ISI. These two experiments enabled us to measure the signal transfer time from a brain region in the ventral visual stream to its counterpart in the opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRI to measure ultra-fast signals (tens of milliseconds) and could facilitate the elucidation of further aspects of dynamic brain function.

Functional changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (ACMRO2) may reflect neural cortical function better than BOLD fMRI, but it is unknown whether the calibrated BOLD model for functional CMRO2 measurement remains valid at high resolution. Here, we measure laminar ACMRO2 elicited by visual stimulation in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) and find that ACMRO2 peaks in the middle of the cortex, in agreement with auto -radiographic measures of metabolism. ACMRO2 values in gray matter are similar as found previously. Reduc-tions in CMRO2 are associated with veins at the cortical surface, suggesting that techniques for vein removal may improve the accuracy of the model at very high resolution. However, our results show feasibility of laminar ACMRO2 measurement, providing a physiologically meaningful metric of laminar functional metabolism.

Here, we present an event-related functional MRI platform in awake pigeons using single-shot RARE fMRI to investigate the neural fundaments for visually-guided decision making. We established a head-fixated Go/NoGo paradigm, which the animals quickly learned under low-stress conditions. The animals were motivated by water reward and behavior was assessed by logging mandibulations during the fMRI experiment with close to zero motion artifacts over hundreds of repeats. To achieve optimal results, we characterized the species-specific hemodynamic response function. As a proof-of-principle, we run a color discrimination task and discovered differential neural networks for Go-, NoGo-, and response execution-phases. Our findings open the door to visualize the neural fundaments of perceptual and cognitive functions in birds-a vertebrate class of which some clades are cognitively on par with primates. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful method to understand neural mechanisms of cognition but imaging of small animals can be challenging. The authors present an event-related fMRI platform to visualize the neural fundaments of perceptual and cognitive functions in awake birds.

Meta-analytic activation maps can help identify affective processes captured by contrast-based task fMRI: the case of threat-related facial expressions	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; meta-analysis map; emotion; fear; anger; facial expression	AMYGDALA; EMOTION; FEAR; REPRESENTATIONS; STIMULI; ANGER; GAZE; MRI	Meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is an effective method for capturing the distributed patterns of brain activity supporting discrete cognitive and affective processes. One opportunity presented by the resulting meta-analysis maps (MAMs) is as a reference for better understanding the nature of individual contrast maps (ICMs) derived from specific task fMRI data. Here, we compared MAMs from 148 neuroimaging studies representing emotion categories of fear, anger, disgust, happiness and sadness with ICMs from fearful > neutral and angry > neutral faces from an independent dataset of task fMRI (n = 1263). Analyses revealed that both fear and anger ICMs exhibited the greatest pattern similarity to fear MAMs. As the number of voxels included for the computation of pattern similarity became more selective, the specificity of MAM-ICM correspondence decreased. Notably, amygdala activity long considered critical for processing threat-related facial expressions was neither sufficient nor necessary for detecting MAM-ICM pattern similarity effects. Our analyses suggest that both fearful and angry facial expressions are best captured by distributed patterns of brain activity, a putative neural correlate of threat. More generally, our analyses demonstrate how MAMs can be leveraged to better understand affective processes captured by ICMs in task fMRI data.	[Kim, M.

Linear systems analysis for laminar fMRI: Evaluating BOLD amplitude scaling for luminance contrast manipulations	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CORTICAL DEPTH; SPIN-ECHO; NEGATIVE BOLD; CBV RESPONSES	A fundamental assumption of nearly all functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses is that the relationship between local neuronal activity and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal can be described as following linear systems theory. With the advent of ultra-high field (7T and higher) MRI scanners, it has become possible to perform sub-millimeter resolution fMRI in humans. A novel and promising application of sub-millimeter fMRI is measuring responses across cortical depth, i.e. laminar imaging. However, the cortical vasculature and associated directional blood pooling towards the pial surface strongly influence the cortical depth-dependent BOLD signal, particularly for gradient-echo BOLD. This directional pooling may potentially affect BOLD linearity across cortical depth. Here we assess whether the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory holds across cortical depth. For this, we use stimuli with different luminance contrasts to elicit different BOLD response amplitudes. We find that BOLD amplitude across cortical depth scales with luminance contrast, and that this scaling is identical across cortical depth. Although nonlinearities may be present for different stimulus configurations and acquisition protocols, our results suggest that the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory across cortical depth holds for luminance contrast manipulations in sub-millimeter laminar BOLD fMRI.

CBF contrast of perfusion fMRI at ultra-high field has not been widely applied in humans to measure laminar activity due to its low sensitivity, while CBV contrast for fMRI using vascular space occupancy (VASO) has been successfully used. However, VASO can be compromised by interference of blood in-flow effects and a temporally limited acquisition window around the blood-nulling time point. Here, we proposed to use DANTE (Delay Alternating with Nutation for Tailored Excitation) pulse trains combined with 3D-EPI to acquire an integrated VASO and perfusion (VAPER) contrast. The signal origin of the VAPER contrast was theoretically evaluated with respect to its CBV and CBF contributions using a four-compartment simulation model. The feasibility of VAPER to measure layer-dependent activity was empirically investigated in human primary motor cortex at 7 T. We demonstrated this new tool, with its highly specified functional layer profile, robust reproducibility, and improved sensitivity, to allow investigation of layer-specific cortical functions.

The aim of this study was to investigate if different radiologically defined GB tumor growth patterns may also influence the fMRI signal, activation pattern and functional connectivity differently. Sixty-four patients with left-hemispheric glioblastoma were included and stratified according to their radiologically defined tumor growth pattern into groups with a uniform (U-TGP) or diffuse tumor growth pattern (D-TGP). Task-based fMRI data were analyzed using SPM12 with the marsbar, LI and CONN toolboxes. The percent signal change and the laterality index were analyzed, as well as functional connectivity between 23 selected ROIs. Comparisons of both patient groups showed only minor non-significant differences, indicating that the tumor growth pattern is not a relevant influencing factor for fMRI signal. In addition to these results, signal reductions were found in areas that were not affected by the tumor underlining that a GB is not a localized but rather a systemic disease affecting the entire brain.

To evaluate the transmit efficiency, specific absorption rate (SAR), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) changes introduced by the HPMs with relative permittivity of 4500, we considered the following configurations in simulation: a whole-body birdcage coil and an Rx-only multi-channel head coil with and without the HPM blocks in the presence of a homogeneous head phantom or a human body model. Experimental studies were also performed with a phantom and with volunteers. Seven healthy volunteers enrolled in a prospective study of fMRI activation in the motor cortex with and with-out HPMs. fMRI data were analyzed using group-level paired T-tests between acquisitions with and with-out HPM blocks. Both electromagnetic simulations and experimental measurements showed ti 25% improvement in the Rx sensitivity of a commercial head coil in the areas of interest when HPM blocks were placed in close proximity. It increased the detected motor cortex fMRI activation volume by an aver-age of 56%, thus resulting in more sensitive functional imaging at 1.5 T.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, resting-state and task-based fMRI (rs- and tb-fMRI) were utilized to examine network changes in a pediatric porcine TBI model that has increased predictive potential in the development of novel therapies. rs- and tb-fMRI were performed one day post-TBI in piglets. Activation maps were generated using group independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary learning (sDL). Activation maps were compared to pig reference functional connectivity atlases and evaluated using Pearson spatial correlation coefficients and mean ratios. Nonparametric permutation analyses were used to determine significantly different activation areas between the TBI and healthy control groups. Significantly lower Pearson values and mean ratios were observed in the visual, executive control, and sensorimotor networks for TBI piglets compared to controls. Significant differences were also observed within several specific individual anatomical structures within each network. In conclusion, both rs- and tb-fMRI demonstrate the ability to detect functional connectivity disruptions in a translational TBI piglet model, and these disruptions can be traced to specific affected anatomical structures.

At a mesoscopic scale, neurons in the human brain are spatially organized in structures with dimensions of hundreds of micrometers, while they communicate at the millisecond timescale. For this reason, it is important to develop an fMRI method with simultaneous high spatial and tem-poral resolution. Line-scanning promises to reach this goal at the cost of volume coverage.New method: Here, we release a comprehensive update to human line-scanning fMRI. First, we investigated multi -echo line-scanning with five different protocols varying the number of echoes and readout bandwidth while keeping the TR constant. In these, we compared different echo combination approaches in terms of BOLD activation (sensitivity) and temporal signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we implemented an adaptation of NOise reduction with DIstribution Corrected principal component analysis (NORDIC) thermal noise removal for line -scanning fMRI data. Finally, we tested three image-based navigators for motion correction and investigated different ways of performing fMRI analysis on the timecourses which were influenced by the insertion of the navigators themselves.Results: The presented improvements are relatively straightforward to implement; multi-echo readout and NORDIC denoising together, significantly improve data quality in terms of tSNR and t-statistical values, while motion correction makes line-scanning fMRI more robust. Comparison with existing methods: Multi-echo acquisitions and denoising have previously been applied in 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Their combination and application to 1D line-scanning is novel. The current proposed method greatly outperforms the previous line-scanning acquisitions with single-echo acquisition, in terms of tSNR (4.0 for single-echo line-scanning and 36.2 for NORDIC-denoised multi-echo) and t-statistical values (3.8 for single-echo line-scanning and 25.1 for NORDIC-denoised multi-echo line-scanning).Conclusions: Line-scanning fMRI was advanced compared to its previous implementation in order to improve sensitivity and reliability. The improved line-scanning acquisition could be used, in the future, for neuroscientific and clinical applications.

J	Nag, S; Uludag, K				Nag, Sayan; Uludag, Kamil			Dynamic Effective Connectivity using Physiologically informed Dynamic Causal Model with Recurrent Units: A functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging simulation study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dynamic effective connectivity; neuroscience; graphical models; BOLD fMRI; causality	CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FLOW; WINDOW; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS	Functional MRI (fMRI) is an indirect reflection of neuronal activity. Using generative biophysical model of fMRI data such as Dynamic Causal Model (DCM), the underlying neuronal activities of different brain areas and their causal interactions (i.e., effective connectivity) can be calculated. Most DCM studies typically consider the effective connectivity to be static for a cognitive task within an experimental run. However, changes in experimental conditions during complex tasks such as movie-watching might result in temporal variations in the connectivity strengths. In this fMRI simulation study, we leverage state-of-the-art Physiologically informed DCM (P-DCM) along with a recurrent window approach and discretization of the equations to infer the underlying neuronal dynamics and concurrently the dynamic (time-varying) effective connectivities between various brain regions for task-based fMRI. Results from simulation studies on 3- and 10-region models showed that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses and effective connectivity time-courses can be accurately predicted and distinguished from faulty graphical connectivity models representing cognitive hypotheses. In summary, we propose and validate a novel approach to determine dynamic effective connectivity between brain areas during complex cognitive tasks by combining P-DCM with recurrent units.

J	Lynch, CJ; Elbau, I; Liston, C				Lynch, Charles J.; Elbau, Immanuel; Liston, Conor			Improving precision functional mapping routines with multi-echo fMRI Charles J Lynch, Immanuel Elbau and Conor Liston	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article							BOLD-CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; DISTRIBUTED NETWORKS; CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION; MOTION; MRI; ENHANCEMENT; SIGNALS	Rapidly developing approaches for acquiring and analyzing densely sampled, single-subject fMRI data have opened new avenues for understanding the neurobiological basis of individual differences in behavior and could allow fMRI to become a more clinically useful tool. Here, we review briefly key insights from these precision functional mapping studies and a highlight significant barrier to their clinical translation. Specifically, that reliable delineation of functional brain networks in individual humans can require hours of restingstate fMRI data per-subject. We found recently that multi-echo fMRI can improve the test-retest reliability of resting-state functional connectivity measurements and mitigate the need for acquiring large quantities of per-subject data. Because the benefits of multi-echo acquisitions are most pronounced in clinically important but artifact-prone brain regions, such as the subgenual cingulate and structures deep in the subcortex, this approach has the potential to increase the impact of precision functional mapping routines in both healthy and clinical populations.

However, the impact of different experimental designs such as event-related or block designs and different stimulus characteristics on the auditory mismatch response and the activity of this network remains controversial. In the present study, we applied five auditory mismatch paradigms with standard experimental designs and recorded fMRI in 31 healthy participants. Brain activity was analyzed using general linear models as well as classification approaches. The results stress a greater role of the type of the applied deviant stimulus compared to the experimental design. Moreover, the absolute number of the deviants as well as the length of the experimental run seems to play a greater role than the experimental design. The present study promotes optimization of experimental paradigms in the context of mismatch research. In particular, our findings contribute to designing auditory mismatch paradigms for application in clinical settings.

N.			A glucose-stimulated BOLD fMRI study of hypothalamic dysfunction in mice fed a high-fat and high-sucrose diet	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Glucose sensing; neuronal stimulation; functional imaging; diet-induced obesity; hypothalamus	ENERGY HOMEOSTASIS; INSULIN; OBESITY; APPETITE; MRI	The hypothalamus is the central regulator of energy homeostasis. Hypothalamic neuronal circuits are disrupted upon overfeeding, and play a role in the development of metabolic disorders. While mouse models have been extensively employed for understanding the mechanisms of hypothalamic dysfunction, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on hypothalamic nuclei has been challenging. We implemented a robust glucose-induced fMRI paradigm that allows to repeatedly investigate hypothalamic responses to glucose. This approach was used to test the hypothesis that hypothalamic nuclei functioning is impaired in mice exposed to a high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for seven days. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal was measured from brains of mice under light isoflurane anaesthesia, during which a 2.6 g/kg glucose load was administered. The mouse hypothalamus responded to glucose but not saline administration with a biphasic BOLD fMRI signal reduction. Relative to controls, HFHSD-fed mice showed attenuated or blunted responses in arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus, but not in paraventricular nucleus. In sum, we have developed an fMRI paradigm that is able to determine dysfunction of glucose-sensing neuronal circuits within the mouse hypothalamus in a non-invasive manner.

A proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial of fMRI-NF of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC), compared to an active control condition, showed promising improvement of ADHD symptoms (albeit in both groups) and in brain function. However, comparison with a placebo condition in a larger trial is required to test efficacy. Methods: This double-blind, sham-controlled randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness and efficacy of fMRI-NF of the rIFC on symptoms and executive functions in 88 boys with ADHD (44 each in the active and shamarms). To investigate treatment-related changes, groups were compared at the posttreatment and 6-month follow-up assessments, controlling for baseline scores, age, and medication status. The primary outcome measure was posttreatment score on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Results: No significant group differences were found on the ADHD-RS. Both groups showed similar decreases in other clinical and cognitive measures, except for a significantly greater decrease in irritability and improvement in motor inhibition in sham relative to active fMRI-NF at the post-treatment assessment, covarying for baseline. There were no significant side effects or adverse events. Theactive relative to the sham fMRI-NF group showed enhanced activation in rIFC and other frontal and temporo-occipital-cerebellar selfregulation areas. However, there was no progressive rIFC upregulation, correlation with ADHD-RSscores, or transfer of learning. Conclusions: Contrary to the hypothesis, the study findings do not suggest that fMRI-NF of the rIFC is effective in improving clinical symptoms or cognition in boys with ADHD.

Here we report the first application of rtfMRI-EEG-nf for emotion self regulation training in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this proof-of-concept study, MDD patients in the experimental group (n = 16) used rtfMRI-EEG-nf during a happy emotion induction task to simultaneously upregulate two fMRI and two EEG activity measures relevant to MDD. The target measures included BOLD activities of the left amygdala (LA) and left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and frontal EEG asymmetries in the alpha band (FAA, [7.5-12.5] Hz) and high-beta band (FBA, [21-30] Hz). MDD patients in the control group (n = 8) were provided with sham feedback signals. An advanced procedure for improved real-time EEG-fMRI artifact correction was implemented. The experimental group participants demonstrated significant upregulation of the LA BOLD activity, FAA, and FBA during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf task, as well as significant enhancement in fMRI connectivity between the LA and left rACC. Average individual FAA changes during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf task positively correlated with depression and anhedonia severities, and negatively correlated with after-vs-before changes in depressed mood ratings. Temporal correlations between the FAA and FBA time courses and the LA BOLD activity were significantly enhanced during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf task. The experimental group participants reported significant mood improvements after the training. Our results suggest that the rtfMRI-EEG-nf may have potential for treatment of MDD.

The modulation of brain dynamic stages can arise from the lateral hypothalamus (LH), where diverse neuronal cell types contribute to arousal regulation in opposite directions via the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the relationship of the LH and pupil dynamics has seldom been investigated. Here, we performed local field potential (LFP) recordings at the LH and ACC, and whole-brain fMRI with simultaneous fiber photometry Ca2+ recording in the ACC, to evaluate their correlation with brain state-dependent pupil dynamics. Both LFP and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data showed various correlations to pupil dynamics across trials that span negative, null, and positive correlation values, demonstrating brain state-dependent coupling features. Our results indicate that the correlation of pupil dynamics with ACC LFP and whole-brain fMRI signals depends on LH activity, suggesting a role of the latter in brain dynamic stage regulation.

As an effective noninvasive neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of mental disorders, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we propose a spatial-temporal co-attention learning (STCAL) model for diagnosing ASD and ADHD from fMRI data. In particular, a guided co-attention (GCA) module is developed to model the intermodal interactions of spatial and temporal signal patterns. A novel sliding cluster attention module is designed to address global feature dependency of self-attention mechanism in fMRI time series. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our STCAL model can achieve competitive accuracies of 73.0 +/- 4.5%, 72.0 +/- 3.8%, and 72.5 +/- 4.2% on the ABIDE I, ABIDE II, and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Moreover, the potential for feature pruning based on the co-attention scores is validated by the simulation experiment. The clinical interpretation analysis of STCAL can allow medical professionals to concentrate on the discriminative regions of interest and key time frames from fMRI data.

J	Fang, YQ; Wang, ML; Potter, GG; Liu, MX				Fang, Yuqi; Wang, Mingliang; Potter, Guy G.; Liu, Mingxia			Unsupervised cross-domain functional MRI adaptation for automated major depressive disorder identification	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Unsupervised domain adaptation; Major depressive disorder; Graph convolutional network; Functional MRI	CONNECTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORK	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data have been widely used for automated diagnosis of brain disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) to assist in timely intervention. Multi -site fMRI data have been increasingly employed to augment sample size and improve statistical power for investigating MDD. However, previous studies usually suffer from significant inter-site heterogeneity caused for instance by differences in scanners and/or scanning protocols. To address this issue, we develop a novel discrepancy-based unsupervised cross-domain fMRI adaptation framework (called UFA-Net) for automated MDD identification. The proposed UFA-Net is designed to model spatio-temporal fMRI patterns of labeled source and unlabeled target samples via an attention-guided graph convolution module, and also leverage a maximum mean discrepancy constrained module for unsupervised cross-site feature alignment between two domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to explore unsupervised rs-fMRI adaptation for cross-site MDD identification. Extensive evaluation on 681 subjects from two imaging sites shows that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Our method helps localize disease-associated functional connectivity abnormalities and is therefore well interpretable and can facilitate fMRI-based analysis of MDD in clinical practice.

Currently, most feature extraction model-based methods for brain state decoding are shallow machine learning models, which may struggle to capture complex and precise spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity from the highly noisy fMRI raw data. Moreover, although decoding models based on deep learning methods benefit from their multilayer structure that could extract spatiotemporal features at multiscale, the relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable, and the explainability of their results is elusive. To address the above problems, we proposed a computational framework based on hybrid spatiotemporal deep belief network and sparse representations to differentiate multitask fMRI (tfMRI) signals. Using a relatively small cohort of tfMRI data as a test bed, our framework can achieve an average classification accuracy of 97.86% and define the multilevel temporal and spatial patterns of multiple cognitive tasks. Intriguingly, our model can characterize the key components for differentiating the multitask fMRI signals. Overall, the proposed framework can identify the interpretable and discriminative fMRI composition patterns at multiple scales, offering an effective methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research with relatively small cohorts. Decoding different cognitive processes using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) is crucial for understanding the relationship between brain activities and cognitive states. However, existing machine learning-based feature extraction methods for decoding brain states may struggle to capture the complex and precise spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity from the highly noisy raw fMRI data. Additionally, current deep learning-based end-to-end decoding models struggle to unveil interpretable components in tfMRI signal decoding. To address these limitations, we proposed a novel framework, the hybrid spatiotemporal deep belief network and sparse representations (DBN-SR) framework, which effectively distinguished multitask fMRI signals with an average accuracy of 97.86%. Furthermore, it simultaneously identified multilevel temporal and spatial patterns of multiple cognitive tasks. By utilizing a novel ratio-of-activation metric, our framework unveiled interpretable components with greater classification capacity, offering an effective methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research.

Based on this framework, we argue that the validity of fMRI studies can be improved by the triangulation of (1) careful design of neuroimaging studies and analyses of data, (2) meta-analyses, and (3) the integration of psychometric and behavioral data with neuroimaging data. Guidelines on when and how to employ triangulation methods on neuroimaging data are included. Moreover, we also included discussions on practices and research directions that validate fMRI studies in consumer neuroscience beyond data triangulation.	[Cao, C.

Detection of resting-state functional connectivity in the lumbar spinal cord with 3T MRI	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FMRI; STIMULATION; NETWORKS; HEALTHY; MOTION	Functional MRI (fMRI) of the spinal cord is an expanding area of research with potential to investigate neuronal activity in the central nervous system. We aimed to characterize the functional connectivity features of the human lumbar spinal cord using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) at 3T, using region-based and data-driven analysis approaches. A 3D multi-shot gradient echo resting-state blood oxygenation level dependent-sensitive rs-fMRI protocol was implemented in 26 healthy participants. Average temporal signal-to-noise ratio in the gray matter was 16.35 +/- 4.79 after denoising. Evidence of synchronous signal fluctuations in the ventral and dorsal horns with their contralateral counterparts was observed in representative participants using interactive, exploratory seed-based correlations. Group-wise average in-slice Pearson's correlations were 0.43 +/- 0.17 between ventral horns, and 0.48 +/- 0.16 between dorsal horns. Group spatial independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify areas of coherent activity, and revealed components within the gray matter corresponding to anatomical regions. Lower-dimensionality ICA revealed bilateral components corresponding to ventral and dorsal networks. Additional separate ICAs were run on two subsets of the participant group, yielding two sets of components that showed visual consistency and moderate spatial overlap. This work shows feasibility of rs-fMRI to probe the functional features and organization of the lumbar spinal cord.

While microstate analysis has been widely employed to analyze EEG data, its use remains less prevalent in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, largely due to the slower timescale of such data. In the present study, we extend various data clustering methods used in EEG microstate analysis to resting-state fMRI data from healthy humans to extract their state-transition dynamics. We show that the quality of clustering is on par with that for various microstate analyses of EEG data. We then develop a method for examining test-retest reliability of the discrete-state transition dynamics between fMRI sessions and show that the within-participant test-retest reliability is higher than between-participant test-retest reliability for different indices of state-transition dynamics, different networks, and different data sets. This result suggests that state-transition dynamics analysis of fMRI data could discriminate between different individuals and is a promising tool for performing fingerprinting analysis of individuals.

BLENDS: Augmentation of Functional Magnetic Resonance Images for Machine Learning Using Anatomically Constrained Warping	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						data augmentation; deep learning; fMRI; machine learning; simulation	REGISTRATION	Introduction: Data augmentation improves the accuracy of deep learning models when training data are scarce by synthesizing additional samples. This work addresses the lack of validated augmentation methods specific for synthesizing anatomically realistic four-dimensional (4D) (three-dimensional [3D] + time) images for neuroimaging, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), by proposing a new augmentation method.Methods: The proposed method, Brain Library Enrichment through Nonlinear Deformation Synthesis (BLENDS), generates new nonlinear warp fields by combining intersubject coregistration maps, computed using symmetric normalization, through spatial blending. These new warp fields can be applied to existing 4D fMRI to create new augmented images. BLENDS was tested on two neuroimaging problems using de-identified data sets: (1) the prediction of antidepressant response from task-based fMRI (original data set n = 163), and (2) the prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptom trajectory from baseline resting-state fMRI regional homogeneity (original data set n = 43).Results: BLENDS readily generates hundreds of new fMRI from existing images, with unique anatomical variations from the source images, that significantly improve prediction performance. For antidepressant response prediction, augmenting each original image once (2 x the original training data) significantly increased prediction R-2 from 0.055 to 0.098 (p < 1e-6), whereas at 10 x augmentation R-2 increased to 0.103. For the prediction of PD trajectory, 10 x augmentation R-2 increased from -0.044 to 0.472 (p < 1e-6).Conclusions: Augmentation of fMRI through nonlinear transformations with BLENDS significantly improved the performance of deep learning models on clinically relevant predictive tasks. This method will help neuroimaging researchers overcome data set size limitations and achieve more accurate predictive models.

In this study, we assessed the impact of electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) on connectivity strength and direction in bilateral motor cortices in chronic stroke patients. Most of the studies using NF or brain computer interfaces for stroke rehabilitation have assessed treatment effects focusing on successful activation of targeted cortical regions. However, given the crucial role of brain network reorganization for stroke recovery, our broader aim was to assess connectivity changes after an NF training protocol targeting localized motor areas. Approach. We considered changes in fMRI connectivity after a multisession EEG-fMRI NF training targeting ipsilesional motor areas in nine stroke patients. We applied the dynamic causal modeling and parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for the estimation of effective connectivity changes. We considered a motor network including both ipsilesional and contralesional premotor, supplementary and primary motor areas. Main results. Our results indicate that NF upregulation of targeted areas (ipsilesional supplementary and primary motor areas) not only modulated activation patterns, but also had a more widespread impact on fMRI bilateral motor networks. In particular, inter-hemispheric connectivity between premotor and primary motor regions decreased, and ipsilesional self-inhibitory connections were reduced in strength, indicating an increase in activation during the NF motor task. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates fMRI connectivity changes elicited by training of localized motor targets in stroke. Our results open new perspectives in the understanding of large-scale effects of NF training and the design of more effective NF strategies, based on the pathophysiology underlying stroke-induced deficits.

A quantitative approach for measuring laterality in clinical fMRI for preoperative language mapping	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Task fMRI; Language fMRI meta-analysis; Laterality index; Pre-operative language mapping	CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; BRAIN-TUMORS; OPTIMIZATION; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; ROBUST; INDEX; MRI	Purpose fMRI is increasingly used for presurgical language mapping, but lack of standard methodology has made it difficult to combine/compare data across institutions or determine the relative efficacy of different approaches. Here, we describe a quantitative analytic framework for determining language laterality in clinical fMRI that addresses these concerns. Methods We retrospectively analyzed fMRI data from 59 patients who underwent presurgical language mapping at our institution with identical imaging and behavioral protocols. First, we compared the efficacy of different regional masks in capturing language activations. Then, we systematically explored how laterality indices (LIs) computed from these masks vary as a function of task and activation threshold. Finally, we determined the percentile threshold that maximized the correlation between the results of our LI approach and the laterality assessments from the original clinical radiology reports. Results First, we found that a regional mask derived from a meta-analysis of the fMRI literature better captured language task activations than masks based on anatomically defined language areas. Then, we showed that an LI approach based on this functional mask and percentile thresholding of subject activation can quantify the relative ability of different language tasks to lateralize language function at the population level. Finally, we determined that the 92nd percentile of subject-level activation provides the optimal LI threshold with which to reproduce the original clinical reports. Conclusion A quantitative framework for determining language laterality that uses a functionally-derived language mask and percentile thresholding of subject activation can combine/compare results across tasks and patients and reproduce clinical assessments of language laterality.

PRATEEK: Integration of Multimodal Neuroimaging Data to Facilitate Advanced Brain Research	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Multimodal integration; neuroimaging; region of interest; spatial overlap	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FMRI; HIPPOCAMPUS; LEVEL; MEG; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; QUANTITATION	Background: In vivo neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are useful techniques to understand brain anatomical structure, functional activity, source localization, neurochemical profiles, and tissue susceptibility respectively. Integrating unique and distinct information from these neuroimaging modalities will further help to enhance the understanding of complex neurological diseases. Objective: To develop a processing scheme for multimodal data integration in a seamless manner on healthy young population, thus establishing a generalized framework for various clinical conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Methods: A multimodal data integration scheme has been developed to integrate the outcomes from multiple neuroimaging data (fMRI, MEG, MRS, and QSM) spatially. Furthermore, the entire scheme has been incorporated into a user-friendly toolbox- "PRATEEK". Results: The proposed methodology and toolbox has been tested for viability among fourteen healthy young participants. The data-integration scheme was tested for bilateral occipital cortices as the regions of interest and can also be extended to other anatomical regions. Overlap percentage from each combination of two modalities (fMRI-MRS, MEG-MRS, fMRI-QSM, and fMRI-MEG) has been computed and also been qualitatively assessed for combinations of the three (MEG-MRS-QSM) and four (fMRI-MEG-MRS-QSM) modalities. Conclusion: This user-friendly toolbox minimizes the need of an expertise in handling different neuroimaging tools for processing and analyzing multimodal data. The proposed scheme will be beneficial for clinical studies where geometric information plays a crucial role for advance brain research.

Neurophysiological hallmarks of Huntington's disease progression: an EEG and fMRI connectivity study	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; functional MRI; Huntington's disease; preclinical stage; HTT gene; CAG repeats; cognitive functions	RESTING-STATE CONNECTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; MOUSE MODEL; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CAG REPEAT; ONSET; PREMANIFEST; PATHOLOGY; RHYTHMS	Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide corroborative data on neurophysiological alterations in Huntington's disease (HD). However, the alterations in EEG and fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), as well as their interrelations, at different stages of HD remain insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to identify neurophysiological alterations in individuals with preclinical HD (preHD) and early manifest HD (EMHD) by analyzing EEG and fMRI rsFC and examining their interrelationships. We found significant differences in EEG power between preHD individuals and healthy controls (HC), with a decrease in power in a specific frequency range at the theta-alpha border and slow alpha activity. In EMHD patients, in addition to the decrease in power in the 7-9 Hz range, a reduction in power within the classic alpha band compared to HC was observed. The fMRI analysis revealed disrupted functional connectivity in various brain networks, particularly within frontal lobe, putamen-cortical, and cortico-cerebellar networks, in individuals with the HD mutation compared to HC. The analysis of the relationship between EEG and fMRI rsFC revealed an association between decreased alpha power, observed in individuals with EMHD, and increased connectivity in large-scale brain networks. These networks include putamen-cortical, DMN-related and cortico-hippocampal circuits. Overall, the findings suggest that EEG and fMRI provide valuable information for monitoring pathological processes during the development of HD. A decrease in inhibitory control within the putamen-cortical, DMN-related and cortico-hippocampal circuits, accompanied by a reduction in alpha and theta-alpha border oscillatory activity, could potentially contribute to cognitive decline in HD.

Its clinical potential has been demonstrated in several applications, but lack of evidence on optimal parameters limits clinical utility of the technique. This study aimed to identify optimal parameters for rt-fMRI-NF-aided craving regulation training in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Adults with AUD (n = 30) participated in a single-session study of four runs of rt-fMRI-NF where they downregulated "craving-related" brain activity. They received one of three types of neurofeedback: multi-region of interest (ROI), support vector machine with continuous feedback (cSVM), and support vector machine with intermittent feedback (iSVM). Performance was assessed on the success rate, change in neural downregulation, and change in self-reported craving for alcohol. Participants had more successful trials in run 4 versus 1, as well as improved downregulation of the insula, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Greater downregulation of the latter two regions predicted greater reduction in craving. iSVM performed significantly worse than the other two methods. Downregulation of the striatum and dlPFC, enabled by ROI but not cSVM neurofeedback, was correlated with a greater reduction in craving. rt-fMRI-NF training for downregulation of alcohol craving in individuals with AUD shows potential for clinical use, though this pilot study should be followed with a larger randomized-control trial before clinical meaningfulness can be established. Preliminary results suggest an advantage of multi-ROI over SVM and intermittent feedback approaches.

Camera-based Prospective Motion Correction in Paediatric Epilepsy Patients Enables EEG-fMRI Localization Even in High-motion States	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Prospective motion correction; EEG-fMRI; Drug-resistant epilepsy; Pediatric epilepsy	FUNCTIONAL MRI; IMAGING DATA; DISCHARGES; ARTIFACT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; IMPACT	Background: EEG-fMRI is a useful additional test to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ) particularly in MRI negative cases. However subject motion presents a particular challenge owing to its large effects on both MRI and EEG signal. Traditionally it is assumed that prospective motion correction (PMC) of fMRI precludes EEG artifact correction. Methods: Children undergoing presurgical assessment at Great Ormond Street Hospital were included into the study. PMC of fMRI was done using a commercial system with a Moire Phase Tracking marker and MR-compatible camera. For retrospective EEG correction both a standard and a motion educated EEG artefact correction (REEGMAS) were compared to each other. Results: Ten children underwent simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Overall head movement was high (mean RMS velocity < 1.5 mm/s) and showed high inter- and intra-individual variability. Comparing motion measured by the PMC camera and the (uncorrected residual) motion detected by realignment of fMRI images, there was a five-fold reduction in motion from its prospective correction. Retrospective EEG correction using both standard approaches and REEGMAS allowed the visualization and identification of physiological noise and epileptiform discharges. Seven of 10 children had significant maps, which were concordant with the clinical EZ hypothesis in 6 of these 7. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first application of camera-based PMC for MRI in a pediatric clinical setting. Despite large amount of movement PMC in combination with retrospective EEG correction recovered data and obtained clinically meaningful results during high levels of subject motion. Practical limitations may currently limit the widespread use of this technology.

Investigating the effects of healthy cognitive aging on brain functional connectivity using 4.7 T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						High-field fMRI; Resting-state fMRI; Brain aging; Network amplitude; Sparse graphs	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; METABOLIC-RATE; OLDER-ADULTS; BOLD SIGNAL	Functional changes in the aging human brain have been previously reported using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Earlier resting-state fMRI studies revealed an age-associated weakening of intra-system functional connectivity (FC) and age-associated strengthening of inter-system FC. However, the majority of such FC studies did not investigate the relationship between age and network amplitude, without which correlation-based measures of FC can be challenging to interpret. Consequently, the main aim of this study was to investigate how three primary measures of resting-state fMRI signal-network amplitude, network topography, and inter-network FC-are affected by healthy cognitive aging. We acquired resting-state fMRI data on a 4.7 T scanner for 105 healthy participants representing the entire adult lifespan (18-85 years of age). To study age differences in network structure, we combined ICA-based network decomposition with sparse graphical models. Older adults displayed lower blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal amplitude in all functional systems, with sensorimotor networks showing the largest age differences. Our age comparisons of network topography and inter-network FC demonstrated a substantial amount of age invariance in the brain's functional architecture. Despite architecture similarities, old adults displayed a loss of communication efficiency in our inter-network FC comparisons, driven primarily by the FC reduction in frontal and parietal association cortices. Together, our results provide a comprehensive overview of age effects on fMRI-based FC.

One type of computational model, the population receptive field (pRF), has been used to describe cortical responses at the millimeter scale using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). However, pRF models are not widely used for non-invasive electromagnetic field measurements (EEG/MEG), because individual sensors pool responses originating from several centimeter of cortex, containing neural populations with widely varying spatial tuning. Here, we introduce a forward-modeling approach in which pRFs estimated from fMRI data are used to predict MEG sensor responses. Subjects viewed contrast-reversing bar stimuli sweeping across the visual field in separate fMRI and MEG sessions. Individual subject's pRFs were modeled on the cortical surface at the millimeter scale using the fMRI data. We then predicted cortical time series and projected these predictions to MEG sensors using a biophysical MEG forward model, accounting for the pooling across cortex. We compared the predicted MEG responses to observed visually evoked steady-state responses measured in the MEG session. We found that pRF parameters estimated by fMRI could explain a substantial fraction of the variance in steady-state MEG sensor responses (up to 60% in individual sensors). Control analyses in which we artificially perturbed either pRF size or pRF position reduced MEG prediction accuracy, indicating that MEG data are sensitive to pRF properties derived from fMRI. Our model provides a quantitative approach to link fMRI and MEG measurements, thereby enabling advances in our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics in human visual field maps.

Word surprisal models can be applied to continuous fMRI recordings during task-free listening of narratives, to detect regions linked to language prediction and comprehension. Here, to this purpose, a novel semantics-weighted lexical surprisal is applied to naturalistic fMRI data. FMRI was performed at 3 Tesla in 31 subjects during task-free listening to a 12-minute audiobook played in both original and word-reversed (control) version. Lexical-only and semantics-weighted lexical surprisal models were estimated for the original and control word series. The two series were alternatively chosen to build the predictor of interest in the first-level general linear model and were compared in the second-level (group) analysis. The addition of the surprisal predictor to the stimulus-related predictors significantly improved the fitting of the neural signal. In average, the semantics-weighted model yielded lower surprisal values and, in some areas, better fitting of the fMRI data compared to the lexical-only model. The two models produced both overlapping and distinct activations: while lexical-only surprisal activated secondary auditory areas in the superior temporal gyri and the cerebellum, semantics-weighted surprisal additionally activated the left inferior frontal gyrus. These results confirm the usefulness of surprisal models in the naturalistic fMRI analysis of linguistic processes and suggest that the use of semantic information may increase the sensitivity of a probabilistic language model in higher-order language-related areas, with possible implications for future naturalistic fMRI studies of language under normal and (clinically or pharmacologically) modified conditions.

This study aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy of high-order autoregressive model (AR(p), where p is the model order) based prewhitening method in the SC correction. Methods Fast fMRI images were acquired at rest (null data) using a multiband simultaneous multi-slice echo planar imaging pulse sequence with repetition time (TR) = 300 and 500 ms. The SC effect in the fast fMRI data was corrected using the prewhitening method based on two AR(p) models: (1) the conventional model (fixed AR(p)) which preselects a constant p for all the image voxels; (2) an improved model (AR(AICc)) that employs the corrected Akaike information criterion voxel-wise to automatically select the model orders for each voxel. To evaluate accuracy of SC correction, false positive characteristics were measured by assuming the presence of block and event-related tasks in the null data without image smoothing. The performance of prewhitening was also examined in smoothed images by adding pseudo task fMRI signals into the null data and comparing the detected to simulated activations (ground truth). Results The measured false positive characteristics agreed well with the theoretical curve when using the AR(AICc), and the activation maps in the smoothed data matched the ground truth. The AR(AICc) showed improved performance than the fixed AR(p) method. Conclusion The AR(AICc) can effectively remove noise SC, and accurate statistical analysis results can be obtained with the AR(AICc) correction in fast fMRI.

In this study, we assessed the ability of tf-fMRI to isolate reproducible networks critical for specific language functions and often damaged in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). First, we performed whole-brain seed-based correlation analyses on tf-fMRI data to identify ICNs anchored in regions known for articulatory, phonological, and semantic processes in healthy male and female controls (HCs). We then evaluated the reproducibility of these ICNs in an independent cohort of HCs, and recapitulated their functional relevance with a post hoc meta-analysis on task-based fMRI. Last, we investigated whether atrophy in these ICNs could inform the differential diagnosis of nonfluent/agrammatic, semantic, and logopenic PPA variants. The identified ICNs included a dorsal articulatory-phonological network involving inferior frontal and supramarginal regions; a ventral semantic network involving anterior middle temporal and angular gyri; a speech perception network involving superior temporal and sensorimotor regions; and a network between posterior inferior temporal and intraparietal regions likely linking visual, phonological, and attentional processes for written language. These ICNs were highly reproducible across independent groups and revealed areas consistent with those emerging from task-based meta-analysis. By comparing ICNs' spatial distribution in HCs with patients' atrophy patterns, we identified ICNs associated with each PPA variant. Our findings demonstrate the potential use of tf-fMRI to investigate the functional status of language networks in patients for whom activation studies can be methodologically challenging.

In 19 patients with PI and 21 HCs, the mean beta value for each region of interest (ROIbval) was calculated with three contrast images (i.e., sleep-related picture, sleep-related sound, and Stroop stimuli). We performed discrimination analysis and compared with features generated from BOLD responses to single-task fMRI. We applied support vector machine analysis with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to evaluate five performance metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, and F2. Principal component features showed the best classification performance in all aspects of metrics compared to BOLD response to single-task fMRI. Bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (orbital), right calcarine cortex, right lingual gyrus, left inferior occipital gyrus, and left inferior temporal gyrus were identified as the most salient areas by feature selection.

However, the relationship between fMRI-BOLD and underlying neural activity is complex and incompletely understood, which poses challenges to interpreting network organization obtained using this technique. Additionally, most work has assumed a disjoint functional network organization (i.e., brain regions belong to one and only one network). Here, we employ wide-field Ca2+ imaging simultaneously with fMRI-BOLD in mice expressing GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons. We determine cortical networks discovered by each modality using a mixed-membership algorithm to test the hypothesis that functional networks exhibit overlapping organization. We find that there is considerable network overlap (both modalities) in addition to disjoint organization. Our results show that multiple BOLD networks are detected via Ca2+ signals, and networks determined by low-frequency Ca2+ signals are only modestly more similar to BOLD networks. In addition, the principal gradient of functional connectivity is nearly identical for BOLD and Ca2+ signals. Despite similarities, important differences are also detected across modalities, such as in measures of functional connectivity strength and diversity. In conclusion, Ca2+ imaging uncovers overlapping functional cortical organization in the mouse that reflects several, but not all, properties observed with fMRI-BOLD signals. The relationship between fMRI-BOLD and neural activity in the brain is not well understood. Here, the authors combine calcium imaging and fMRI in the mouse brain to compare network organization derived from these imaging modalities.

Natural bladder filling alters resting brain function at multiple spatial scales: a proof-of-concept MAPP Network Neuroimaging Study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MOTION CORRECTION; NEURAL-CONTROL; OLDER WOMEN; STATE; PAIN; CONNECTIVITY; MICTURITION; URGE; SEGMENTATION; REGISTRATION	Neural circuitry regulating urine storage in humans has been largely inferred from fMRI during urodynamic studies driven by catheter infusion of fluid into the bladder. However, urodynamic testing may be confounded by artificially filling the bladder repeatedly at a high rate and examining associated time-locked changes in fMRI signals. Here we describe and test a more ecologically-valid paradigm to study the brain response to bladder filling by (1) filling the bladder naturally with oral water ingestion, (2) examining resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) which is more natural since it is not linked with a specific stimulus, and (3) relating rs-fMRI measures to self-report (urinary urge) and physiologic measures (voided volume). To establish appropriate controls and analyses for future clinical studies, here we analyze data collected from healthy individuals (N=62) as part of the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network. Participants orally ingested approximately 350 mL of water, and had a 10 min "fuller bladder" rs-fMRI scan approximately 1 h later. A second 10 min "empty bladder" rs-fMRI scan was conducted immediately following micturition. We examined multiple spatial scales of brain function, including local activity, circuits, and networks. We found changes in brain function distributed across micturition loci (e.g., subregions of the salience, sensorimotor, and default networks) that were significantly related to the stimulus (volume) and response (urinary urge). Based on our results, this paradigm can be applied in the future to study the neurobiological underpinnings of urologic conditions.

Traditionally, techniques such as PCA and ICA, which rely on strong non-physiological assumptions such as orthogonality and statistical independence, have been used for this purpose. Recently, tensor decomposition techniques such as parallel factor analysis have gained more popularity in neuroimaging applications as they are able to inherently contain the multidimensionality of neuroimaging data and achieve uniqueness in decomposition without making strong assumptions. Previously, the coupled matrix-tensor decomposition (CMTD) has been applied for the fusion of the EEG and fMRI. Only recently the coupled tensor-tensor decomposition (CTTD) has been proposed. Here for the first time, we propose the use of CTTD of a 4th order EEG tensor (space, time, frequency, and participant) and 3rd order fMRI tensor (space, time, participant), coupled partially in time and participant domains, for the extraction of the task related features in both modalities. We used both the sensor-level and source-level EEG for the coupling. The phase shifted paradigm signals were incorporated as the temporal initializers of the CTTD to extract the task related features. The validation of the approach is demonstrated on simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from six participants performing an N-Back memory task. The EEG and fMRI tensors were coupled in 9 components out of which seven components had a high correlation (more than 0.85) with the task. The result of the fusion recapitulates the well-known attention network as being positively, and the default mode network working negatively time-locked to the memory task.

Topological Data Analysis Captures Task-Driven fMRI Profiles in Individual Participants: A Classification Pipeline Based on Persistence	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Topological data analysis; Persistence landscapes; fMRI; Motor control; Anterior cingulate	ANTERIOR CINGULATE; MOTOR CONTROL; BRAIN RESPONSES; DISORDER; NETWORK; ACTIVATION; INSULA; MODELS; CORTEX; MRI	BOLD-based fMRI is the most widely used method for studying brain function. The BOLD signal while valuable, is beset with unique vulnerabilities. The most notable of these is the modest signal to noise ratio, and the relatively low temporal and spatial resolution. However, the high dimensional complexity of the BOLD signal also presents unique opportunities for functional discovery. Topological Data Analyses (TDA), a branch of mathematics optimized to search for specific classes of structure within high dimensional data may provide particularly valuable applications. In this investigation, we acquired fMRI data in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using a basic motor control paradigm. Then, for each participant and each of three task conditions, fMRI signals in the ACC were summarized using two methods: a) TDA based methods of persistent homology and persistence landscapes and b) non-TDA based methods using a standard vectorization scheme. Finally, using machine learning (with support vector classifiers), classification accuracy of TDA and non-TDA vectorized data was tested across participants. In each participant, TDA-based classification out-performed the non-TDA based counterpart, suggesting that our TDA analytic pipeline better characterized task- and condition-induced structure in fMRI data in the ACC. Our results emphasize the value of TDA in characterizing task- and condition-induced structure in regional fMRI signals. In addition to providing our analytical tools for other users to emulate, we also discuss the unique role that TDA-based methods can play in the study of individual differences in the structure of functional brain signals in the healthy and the clinical brain.

Heartbeat-evoked neural response abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorder during peripheral adrenergic stimulation	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							INSULAR CORTEX; EEG-DATA; DSM-IV; INTEROCEPTION; VALIDATION; POTENTIALS; AROUSAL; FMRI	Hyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning. Intravenous infusions of the peripheral adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms, mu g) were administered in a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to dynamically perturb the cardiovascular system while recording the associated EEG-fMRI responses. During the 0.5 mu g isoproterenol infusion, the GAD group (n = 24) exhibited significantly larger changes in HEP amplitude in an opposite direction than the healthy comparison (HC) group (n = 24). In addition, the GAD group showed significantly larger absolute HEP amplitudes than the HC group during saline infusions, when cardiovascular tone did not increase. No significant group differences in HEP amplitude were identified during the 2.0 mu g isoproterenol infusion. Using analyzable blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI data from participants with concurrent EEG-fMRI data (21 GAD and 21 HC), we found that the aforementioned HEP effects were uncorrelated with fMRI signals in the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex, brain regions implicated in cardiac signal processing in prior fMRI studies. These findings provide additional evidence of dysfunctional cardiac interoception in GAD and identify neural processes at the electrophysiological level that may be independent from blood oxygen level-dependent responses during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.

Effects of different smoothing on global and regional resting functional connectivity	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; Functional connectivity; Spatial smoothing	INFERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; FMRI; STATE; RESOLUTION; FORCE; NOISE; POWER; AGE	Purpose Spatial smoothing is an essential pre-processing step in the process of analysing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, both during an experimental task or during resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI). The main benefit of this spatial smoothing step is to artificially increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the fMRI signal. Previous fMRI studies have investigated the impact of spatial smoothing on task fMRI data, while rsfMRI studies usually apply the same analytical process used for the task data. However, this study investigates changes in different rsfMRI analyses, such as ROI-to-ROI, seed-to-voxels and ICA analyses. Methods Nineteen healthy volunteers were scanned using rsfMRI with three applied smoothing kernels: 0 mm, 4 mm and 8 mm. Appropriate statistical comparisons were made. Results The findings showed that spatial smoothing has a greater effect on rsfMRI data when analysed using seed-to-voxel-based analysis. The effect was less pronounced when analysing data using ROI-ROI or ICA analyses. The results demonstrated that even when analysing the data without the application of spatial smoothing, the results were significant compared with data analysed using a typical smoothing kernel. However, data analysed with lower-smoothing kernels produced greater negative correlations, particularly with the ICA analysis. Conclusion The results suggest that a medium smoothing kernel (around 4 mm) may be preferable, as it is comparable with the 8 mm kernel in all of the analyses performed. It is also recommended that the researchers consider analysing the data using two different smoothing kernels, as this will help to confirm the significance of the results and avoid overestimating the findings.

Discovery of multilevel brain activation region intensities in rs-fMRI video frames	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article						Betti number; Brain activation region; CW space; Cell complex; Cycle; Free group presentation; Multi-level intensities; Quaternion; rs-fMRI; Shape; Vortex		This paper introduces quaternionic views of multi-level brain activation region intensities in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) videos. Quaternions make it possible to explore rs-fMRI brain activation regions in a 4D space in which there are varying brain activation intensities in spiralling activation cycles (each with its own intensity). As a result, there is a natural formation of multi-level cycles that form pyramidal vortex shapes with varying diameters. These pyramidal vortexes reflect the fractality (self-similarity) of clusters of similar multilevel brain activation region cycles. Using a computational topology of data approach, we have found that persistent, recurring clusters of spiraling cycles resulting from blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in triangulated rs-fMRI video frames. Each brain activation region cycle is a cell complex , which is a collection path-connected vertexes that has no end vertex. Measurement of persistence of spiraling vortex shapes in BOLD signal propagation regions is carried out in terms of Betti numbers (counts of distinguished cycle vertexes called generators) that rise and fall over time during spontaneous activity of the brain. A main result given here is that every quaternionic brain activation region vortex has a free group presentation. In addition, we introduce 3D barcodes of brain activation videos that help visualize and quantify the fractality of clusters of multilevel vortexes arising naturally from triangulated brain activation regions in rs-fMRI video frames. We have made freely available downloadable archives of videos that exhibit the resulting clusters of spiraling brain activation cycles. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Don, Arjuna P.

We investigated the population activity in M1 for single finger flexion and extension, using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in female and male human participants and compared these results to the neural spiking patterns recorded in two male monkeys performing the identical task. fMRI activity patterns were distinct for movements of different fingers, but were quite similar for flexion and extension of the same finger. In contrast, spiking patterns in monkeys were quite distinct for both fingers and directions, which is similar to what was found for muscular activity patterns. The discrepancy between fMRI and electrophysiological measurements can be explained by two (non-mutually exclusive) characteristics of the organization of finger flexion and extension movements. Given that fMRI reflects predominantly input and recurrent activity, the results can be explained by an architecture in which neural populations that control flexion or extension of the same finger produce distinct outputs, but interact tightly with each other and receive similar inputs. Additionally, neurons tuned to different movement directions for the same finger (or combination of fingers) may cluster closely together, while neurons that control different finger combinations may be more spatially separated. When measuring this organization with fMRI at a coarse spatial scale, the activity patterns for flexion and extension of the same finger would appear very similar. Overall, we suggest that the discrepancy between fMRI and electrophysiological measurements provides new insights into the general organization of fine finger movements in M1.

J	Misaki, M; Bodurka, J				Misaki, Masaya; Bodurka, Jerzy			The impact of real-time fMRI denoising on online evaluation of brain activity and functional connectivity	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fMRI real-time processing; denoising; physiological noise; functional connectivity; brain-computer interface; neurofeedback	WINDOW CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; GLOBAL SIGNAL; MOTION CORRECTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; NEUROFEEDBACK; FLUCTUATIONS; REGRESSION; NETWORKS; NUISANCE; PROGRESS	Objective. Comprehensive denoising is imperative in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis to reliably evaluate neural activity from the blood oxygenation level dependent signal. In real-time fMRI, however, only a minimal denoising process has been applied and the impact of insufficient denoising on online brain activity estimation has not been assessed comprehensively. This study evaluated the noise reduction performance of online fMRI processes in a real-time estimation of regional brain activity and functional connectivity. Approach. We performed a series of real-time processing simulations of online fMRI processing, including slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing, signal scaling, and noise regression with high-pass filtering, motion parameters, motion derivatives, global signal, white matter/ventricle average signals, and physiological noise models with image-based retrospective correction of physiological motion effects (RETROICOR) and respiration volume per time (RVT). Main results. All the processing was completed in less than 400 ms for whole-brain voxels. Most processing had a benefit for noise reduction except for RVT that did not work due to the limitation of the online peak detection. The global signal regression, white matter/ventricle signal regression, and RETROICOR had a distinctive noise reduction effect, depending on the target signal, and could not substitute for each other. Global signal regression could eliminate the noise-associated bias in the mean dynamic functional connectivity across time. Significance. The results indicate that extensive real-time denoising is possible and highly recommended for real-time fMRI applications.

J	Zhang, XD; Pan, WJ; Keilholz, SD				Zhang, Xiaodi; Pan, Wen-Ju; Keilholz, Shella Dawn			The relationship between BOLD and neural activity arises from temporally sparse events	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; BOLD; Electrophysiology; Instantaneous co-activation; BOLD-Triggered average	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; FMRI; SIGNALS; CORTEX; ANESTHESIA; ISOFLURANE; RATS	Resting state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) imaging offers insights into how different brain regions are connected into functional networks. It was recently shown that networks that are almost identical to the ones created from conventional correlation analysis can be obtained from a subset of high-amplitude data, suggesting that the functional networks may be driven by instantaneous co-activations of multiple brain regions rather than ongoing oscillatory processes. The rs-fMRI studies, however, rely on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which is only indirectly sensitive to neural activity through neurovascular coupling. To provide more direct evidence that the neuronal co-activation events produce the time-varying network patterns seen in rs-fMRI studies, we examined the simultaneous rs-fMRI and local field potential (LFP) recordings in rats performed in our lab over the past several years. We developed complementary analysis methods that focus on either the temporal or spatial domain, and found evidence that the interaction between LFP and BOLD may be driven by instantaneous co-activation events as well. BOLD maps triggered on high-amplitude LFP events resemble co-activation patterns created from rs-fMRI data alone, though the co-activation time points are defined differently in the two cases. Moreover, only LFP events that fall into the highest or lowest thirds of the amplitude distribution result in a BOLD signal that can be distinguished from noise. These findings provide evidence of an electrophysiological basis for the time-varying co-activation patterns observed in previous studies.

Mode decomposition-based time-varying phase synchronization for fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Mode decomposition; Phase synchronization; Functional connectivity; Resting-state fMRI; Multivariate variational mode decomposition; Time-varying phase synchronization	RESTING-STATE FMRI; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; FLUCTUATIONS; NOISE; REDUCTION; DYNAMICS	Recently, there has been significant interest in measuring time-varying functional connectivity (TVC) between different brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. However, this requires the a priori choice of type and cut-offfrequencies for the bandpass filter needed to perform the analysis. Here we explore alternative approaches based on the use of various mode decomposition (MD) techniques that provide a more data driven solution to this issue. These techniques allow for the data driven decomposition of signals jointly into narrow-band components at different frequencies, thus fulfilling the requirements needed to measure PS. We explore several variants of MD, including empirical mode decomposition (EMD), bivariate EMD (BEMD), noise-assisted multivariate EMD (na-MEMD), and introduce the use of multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) in the context of estimating time-varying PS. We contrast the approaches using a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results show that MVMD outperforms other evaluated MD approaches, and further suggests that this approach can be used as a tool to reliably investigate time-varying PS in rs-fMRI data.

Previous DBS-fMRI studies could not provide full activation pattern maps due to poor MRI compatibility of the DBS electrodes, which caused obstruction of large brain areas on MRI scans. Here, we fabricate graphene fiber (GF) electrodes with high charge-injection-capacity and little-to-no MRI artifact at 9.4T. DBS-fMRI with GF electrodes at the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinsonian rats reveal robust blood-oxygenation-level-dependent responses along the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network in a frequency-dependent manner, with responses from some regions not previously detectable. This full map indicates that STN-DBS modulates both motor and non-motor pathways, possibly through orthodromic and antidromic signal propagation. With the capability for full, unbiased activation pattern mapping, DBS-fMRI using GF electrodes can provide important insights into DBS therapeutic mechanisms in various neurological disorders. Combination of fMRI and deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for large-scale mapping of brain responses to DBS. Here the authors develop highly MRI compatible graphene fiber electrodes for full brain activation pattern mapping under DBS in Parkinsonian rats.

Low frequency oscillations (LFOs) can be successfully identified from BOLD fMRI and used to study characteristics of neuronal and physiological activity. Here, we evaluate the use of carpet plots paired with a developed slope-detection algorithm as a means to study LFOs in resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data with the help of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI data. Carpet plots were constructed by ordering voxels according to signal delay time for each voxel. The slope-detection algorithm was used to identify and calculate propagation times, or "transit times", of tilted vertical edges across which a sudden signal change was observed. We aim to show that this metric has applications in understanding LFOs in fMRI data, possibly reflecting changes in blood flow speed during the scan, and for evaluating alternative blood-tracking contrast agents such as inhaled CO2. We demonstrate that the propagations of LFOs can be visualized and automatically identified in a carpet plot as tilted lines of sudden intensity change. Resting state carpet plots produce edges with transit times similar to those of DSC carpet plots. Additionally, resting state carpet plots indicate that edge transit times vary at different time points during the scan.

EEG and fMRI Correlates of Insight: A Pilot Study	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						insight; EEG; fMRI		Insight is described as the sudden solution of a problem and is contrasted with an analytical, step-by-step approach. Traditionally, insight is thought to be associated with activity of the right hemisphere, whereas analytical solutions are thought to be associated with activity of the left hemisphere. However, empirical evidence as to the localization of insight-related brain activity is mixed and inconclusive. Some studies seem to confirm the traditional view, whereas others do not. Moreover, results of EEG and fMRI studies frequently contradict each other. In this study, EEG and fMRI data were recorded while subjects performed the remote association test and for each solved problem were asked to report whether the solution was reached analytically or insightfully. The data were analyzed in a 16-second fragment preceding the subject's response. Source localization techniques were used in the analysis of EEG data. Based on EEG data, insightful as compared to analytical problem solving was accompanied by high-frequency synchronization in semantic cortical areas of the left hemisphere 10-12 s before the subject's response. Based on fMRI data, however, insightful solutions were accompanied by increased activity in frontal and temporal regions of the right hemisphere. The results are interpreted in terms of different cognitive processes involved in insightful problem solving, which could be differently reflected in EEG and fMRI data.

Age-related changes in the association of resting-state fMRI signal variability and global functional connectivity in non-demented healthy people	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Age-related brain activity change; Voxel-wise functional connectivity; Brain signal variability; Resting-state fmri signal	BRAIN ACTIVITY; MEMORY; DEFAULT; COMPLEXITY; LEVEL	Research suggests that the aging relates to variability of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal and the functional connectivity. However, the association between the spatial and temporal activity of resting-state fMRI signal was less documented. We recruited 477 healthy Han Chinese participants, who were separated into young, middle and old groups to investigate the relationship between the variability and global functional connectivity (gFC) in different age ranges using standard deviation (SD) of time series and gFC, respectively. Our analysis revealed the changing patterns during healthy aging: 1) 17 brain regions(Olfactory_L, Orbital_L etc.) were identified to have significant association of age with both SD and gFC respectively by linear regression analysis; 2) Two typical associations could be observed between SD and gFC: positive and negative correlations; 3) The variation ratio of SD to gFC was changing with age at the voxel level by using unsupervised clustering method. It is the first time to combine voxel-wise variability and gFC together for the study of age-related changes with rs-fMRI signal. This study may provide a new clue for understanding the synchronization of human brain based on SD and gFC due to the effect of aging.

J	Chen, X; Wu, WC; Chiew, M				Chen, Xi; Wu, Wenchuan; Chiew, Mark			Improving robustness of 3D multi-shot EPI by structured low-rank reconstruction of segmented CAIPI sampling for fMRI at 7T	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						3D fMRI; 7T fMRI; Multi-shot EPI; Physiological noise; CAIPI sampling; Structured low-rank reconstruction; Block-Hankel structured matrix	K-SPACE NEIGHBORHOODS; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; ACCELERATION; MRI; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; LORAKS; SENSE	Three-dimensional (3D) encoding methods are increasingly being explored as alternatives to two-dimensional (2D) multi-slice acquisitions in fMRI, particularly in cases where high isotropic resolution is needed. 3D multi-shot EPI acquisition, as the workhorse of 3D fMRI imaging, is susceptible to physiological fluctuations which can induce inter-shot phase variations, and thus reducing the achievable tSNR, negating some of the benefit of 3D encoding. This issue can be particularly problematic at ultra-high fields like 7T, which have more severe off-resonance effects. In this work, we aim to improve the temporal stability of 3D multi-shot EPI at 7T by improving its robustness to inter-shot phase variations. We presented a 3D segmented CAIPI sampling trajectory ( "seg-CAIPI ") and an improved reconstruction method based on Hankel structured low-rank matrix recovery. Simulation and in-vivo results demonstrate that the combination of the seg-CAIPI sampling scheme and the proposed structured low-rank reconstruction is a promising way to effectively reduce the unwanted temporal variance induced by inter-shot physiological fluctuations, and thus improve the robustness of 3D multi-shot EPI for fMRI.

RT-Cloud: A cloud-based software framework to simplify and standardize real-time fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Cloud-computing; Software-as-a-service	NEUROFEEDBACK; BRAIN	Real-time fMRI (RT-fMRI) neurofeedback has been shown to be effective in treating neuropsychiatric disorders and holds tremendous promise for future breakthroughs, both with regard to basic science and clinical applications. However, the prevalence of its use has been hampered by computing hardware requirements, the complexity of setting up and running an experiment, and a lack of standards that would foster collaboration. To address these issues, we have developed RT-Cloud (https://github.com/brainiak/rt-cloud), a flexible, cloud-based, opensource Python software package for the execution of RT-fMRI experiments. RT-Cloud uses standardized data formats and adaptable processing streams to support and expand open science in RT-fMRI research and applications. Cloud computing is a key enabling technology for advancing RT-fMRI because it eliminates the need for on-premise technical expertise and high-performance computing; this allows installation, configuration, and maintenance to be automated and done remotely. Furthermore, the scalability of cloud computing makes it easier to deploy computationally-demanding multivariate analyses in real time. In this paper, we describe how RT-Cloud has been integrated with open standards, including the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and the OpenNeuro database, how it has been applied thus far, and our plans for further development and deployment of RT-Cloud in the coming years.

In nonlesional cases, where no epileptogenic lesion can be detected on structural magnetic resonance imaging, multimodal neuroimaging studies are required. Breath-hold-triggered BOLD fMRI (bh-fMRI) was developed to measure cerebrovascular reactivity in stroke or angiopathy and highlights regional network dysfunction by visualizing focal impaired flow increase after vasodilatory stimulus. This regional dysfunction may correlate with the epileptogenic zone. In this prospective single-center single-blind pilot study, we aimed to establish the feasibility and safety of bh-fMRI in individuals with drug-resistant non-lesional focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation.MethodsIn this prospective study, 10 consecutive individuals undergoing presurgical evaluation for drug-resistant focal epilepsy were recruited after case review at a multidisciplinary patient management conference. Electroclinical findings and results of other neuroimaging were used to establish the epileptogenic zone hypothesis. To calculate significant differences in cerebrovascular reactivity in comparison to the normal population, bh-fMRIs of 16 healthy volunteers were analyzed. The relative flow change of each volume of interest (VOI) of the atlas was then calculated compared to the flow change of the whole brain resulting in an atlas of normal cerebral reactivity. Consequently, the mean flow change of every VOI of each patient was tested against the healthy volunteers group. Areas with significant impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity had decreased flow change and were compared to the epileptogenic zone localization hypothesis in a single-blind design.ResultsAcquisition of bh-fMRI was feasible in 9/10 cases, with one patient excluded due to noncompliance with breathing maneuvers. No adverse events were observed, and breath-hold for intermittent hypercapnia was well tolerated. On blinded review, we observed full or partial concordance of the local network dysfunction seen on bh-fMRI with the electroclinical hypothesis in 6/9 cases, including cases with extratemporal lobe epilepsy and those with nonlocalizing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).ConclusionThis represents the first report of bh-fMRI in individuals with epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation. We found bh-fMRI to be feasible and safe, with a promising agreement to electroclinical findings. Thus, bh-fMRI may represent a potential modality in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. Further studies are needed to establish clinical utility.

Within-subject reliability of concurrent TMS-fMRI during a single session	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						concurrent TMS-fMRI; functional MRI; reliability; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; DORSAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORKS; MOTOR; RTMS; REMISSION; THERAPY; MRI	Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation with functional MRI (concurrent TMS-fMRI) allows real-time causative probing of brain connectivity. However, technical challenges, safety, and tolerability may limit the number of trials employed during a concurrent TMS-fMRI experiment. We leveraged an existing data set with 100 trials of active TMS compared to a sub-threshold control condition to assess the reliability of the evoked BOLD response during concurrent TMS-fMRI. This data will permit an analysis of the minimum number of trials that should be employed in a concurrent TMS-fMRI protocol in order to achieve reliable spatial changes in activity. Single-subject maps of brain activity were created by splitting the trials within the same experimental session into groups of 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, or 10 trials, correlations (R) between t-maps derived from paired subsets of trials within the same individual were calculated as reliability. R was moderate-high for 50 trials (mean R = .695) and decreased as the number of trials decreased. Consistent with previous findings of high individual variability in the spatial patterns of evoked neuronal changes following a TMS pulse, the spatial pattern of Rs differed across participants, but regional R was correlated with the magnitude of TMS-evoked activity. These results demonstrate concurrent TMS-fMRI produces a reliable pattern of activity at the individual level at higher trial numbers, particularly within localized regions. The spatial pattern of reliability is individually idiosyncratic and related to the individual pattern of evoked changes.

We present a data-driven method to automatically delineate the motor cortex using task-free, resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. Methods We used whole-brain rsfMRI for independent component analysis (ICA). A template matching process with Discriminability Index-based Component Identification score was used for each participant to select and combine motor ICA components in their native brain space, resulting in a whole-brain ICA Motor Map (wIMM). We validated wIMM by comparing individual results with bilateral finger-tapping motor task fMRI activation, and evaluated its reproducibility in controls. Results Data from 64 patients and 12 controls were used to generate group wIMM maps. The hit rate between wIMM and motor task activation ranged from 60% to 79% across all participants. Sensitivity of wIMM for capturing the task activation peak was 87.5% among 32 patients and 100% in 12 controls with available motor task results. We also showed high similarity in repeated runs in controls. Conclusions Our results show the sensitivity and reproducibility of an automated motor mapping method based on ICA analysis of rsfMRI in children with epilepsy. The ICA maps may provide different, but useful, information than task fMRI. Future studies will expand our method to mapping other brain functions, and may lead to a surgical planning tool for patients who cannot perform task fMRI and help predict their postsurgical function.

COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						Implicit memory; priming; explicit memory; conscious; contamination; hippocampus; fMRI; review	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; RELATIONAL MEMORY; STIMULI; NOVELTY; RECOLLECTION; DISSOCIATION; ACTIVATION	According to the traditional memory-systems view, the hippocampus is critical during explicit (conscious) long-term memory, whereas other brain regions support implicit (nonconscious) memory. In the last two decades, some fMRI studies have reported hippocampal activity during implicit memory tasks. The aim of the present discussion paper was to identify whether any implicit memory fMRI studies have provided convincing evidence that the hippocampus is associated with nonconscious processes without being confounded by conscious processes. Experimental protocol and analysis parameters included the stimulus type(s), task(s), measures of subjective awareness, explicit memory accuracy, the relevant fMRI contrast(s) or analysis, and confound(s). A systematic review was conducted to identify implicit memory studies that reported fMRI activity in the hippocampus. After applying exclusion criteria, 13 articles remained for analysis. We found that there were no implicit memory fMRI studies where subjective awareness was absent, explicit memory performance was at chance, and there were no confounds that could have driven the observed hippocampal activity. The confounds included explicit memory (including false memory), imbalanced attentional states between conditions (yielding activation of the default-mode network), imbalanced stimuli between conditions, and differential novelty. As such, not a single fMRI study provided convincing evidence that implicit memory was associated with the hippocampus. Neuropsychological evidence was also considered, and implicit memory deficits were caused by factors known to disrupt brain regions beyond the hippocampus, such that the behavioral effects could not be attributed to this region. The present results indicate that implicit memory is not associated with the hippocampus.

However, no previous studies specifically compared the predictive value of different rs-fMRI parameters in preclinical AD. Methods: A total of 106 cognitively normal adults (A beta+ group = 66 and A beta- group = 40) were included. Three different rs-fMRI parameter maps including functional connectivity (FC), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were utilized to compare classification performance of the three rs-fMRI parameters. Results: FC maps showed the best classifying performance in ROC curve analysis (AUC, 0.915, p < 0.001). Good but weaker performance was achieved by using ReHo maps (AUC, 0.836, p < 0.001) and fALFF maps (AUC, 0.804, p < 0.001). The brain regions showing the greatest discriminative power included the left angular gyrus for FC, left anterior cingulate for ReHo, and left middle frontal gyrus for fALFF. However, among the three measurements, ROI-based FC was the only measure showing group difference in voxel-wise analysis. Conclusion: Our results strengthen the idea that rs-fMRI might be sensitive to earlier changes in spontaneous brain activity and FC in response to cerebral A beta retention. However, further longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm their utility in predicting the risk of AD.

The rabbit subjects used in this work are an ideal model system for studying learning and behavior and are also an excellent established test subject for awake scanning given their natural tolerance for restraint. We found that analysis of rs-fMRI conducted on a cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning can reveal functional brain connectivity changes associated with learning, and that rs-fMRI can be used to capture differences between subjects with different levels of cognitive performance. rs-fMRI sessions were conducted on a cohort of rabbits before and after trace eyeblink conditioning. MRI results were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and network analysis. Behavioral data were collected with standard methods using an infrared reflective sensor aimed at the cornea to detect blinks. Behavioral results were analyzed, and a median split was used to create two groups of rabbits based on their performance. The cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning exhibited increased functional connectivity in the cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and thalamus consistent with brain reorganization associated with increased learning. Differences in the striatum and right cerebellum were also identified between rabbits in the top or bottom halves of the group as measured by the behavioral assay. Thus, rs-fMRI can provide not only a tool to detect and monitor functional brain changes associated with learning, but also to discriminate between different levels of cognitive performance.

It has been shown that fMRI data quality can be improved by prospectively updating the gradients and radio-frequency pulses in response to head motion during image acquisition by using an MR-compatible optical tracking system (prospective motion correction, or PMC). Recent studies showed that PMC improves the temporal Signal to Noise Ratio (tSNR) of resting state fMRI data (rs-fMRI) acquired from subjects not moving intentionally. Besides that, the time courses of Independent Components (ICs), resulting from Independent Component Analysis (ICA), were found to present significant temporal correlation with the motion parameters recorded by the camera. However, the benefits of applying PMC for improving the quality of rsfMRI acquired under large head movements and its effects on resting state networks (RSN) and connectivity matrices are still unknown. In this study, subjects were instructed to cross their legs at will while rs-fMRI data with and without PMC were acquired, which generated head motion velocities ranging from 4 to 30 mm/s. We also acquired fMRI data without intentional motion. Independent component analysis of rs-fMRI was performed to evaluate IC maps and time courses of RSNs. We also calculated the temporal correlation among different brain regions and generated connectivity matrices for the different motion and PMC conditions. In our results we verified that the crossing leg movements reduced the tSNR of sessions without and with PMC by 45 and 20%, respectively, when compared to sessions without intentional movements. We have verified an interaction between head motion speed and PMC status, showing stronger attenuation of tSNR for acquisitions without PMC than for those with PMC. Additionally, the spatial definition of major RSNs, such as default mode, visual, left and right central executive networks, was improved when PMC was enabled. Furthermore, motion altered IC-time courses by decreasing power at low frequencies and increasing power at higher frequencies (typically associated with artefacts). PMC partially reversed these alterations of the power spectra. Finally, we showed that PMC provides temporal correlation matrices for data acquired under motion conditions more comparable to those obtained by fMRI sessions where subjects were instructed not to move.

BrainNET: Inference of Brain Network Topology Using Machine Learning	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						brain; connectivity analysis; fMRI; machine learning	ATTENTION; ADHD; CHILDREN; HUBS	Background:To develop a new functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) network inference method, BrainNET, that utilizes an efficient machine learning algorithm to quantify contributions of various regions of interests (ROIs) in the brain to a specific ROI. Methods:BrainNET is based on extremely randomized trees to estimate network topology from fMRI data and modified to generate an adjacency matrix representing brain network topology, without reliance on arbitrary thresholds. Open-source simulated fMRI data of 50 subjects in 28 different simulations under various confounding conditions with known ground truth were used to validate the method. Performance was compared with correlation and partial correlation (PC). The real-world performance was then evaluated in a publicly available attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) data set, including 134 typically developing children (mean age: 12.03, males: 83), 75 ADHD inattentive (mean age: 11.46, males: 56), and 93 ADHD combined (mean age: 11.86, males: 77) subjects. Network topologies in ADHD were inferred using BrainNET, correlation, and PC. Graph metrics were extracted to determine differences between the ADHD groups. Results:BrainNET demonstrated excellent performance across all simulations and varying confounders in identifying the true presence of connections. In the ADHD data set, BrainNET was able to identify significant changes (p < 0.05) in graph metrics between groups. No significant changes in graph metrics between ADHD groups were identified using correlation and PC. Conclusion:We describe BrainNET, a new network inference method to estimate fMRI connectivity that was adapted from gene regulatory methods. BrainNET out-performed Pearson correlation and PC in fMRI simulation data and real-world ADHD data. BrainNET can be used independently or combined with other existing methods as a useful tool to understand network changes and to determine the true network topology of the brain under various conditions and disease states. Impact statement Developed a new functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) network inference method named as BrainNET using machine learning.

Elucidating the complementarity of resting-state networks derived from dynamic [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FDG and hemodynamic fluctuations using simultaneous small-animal PET/MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting-state networks; Functional connectivity; Dynamic [F-18]FDG correlations; Connectomics; simultaneous PET/MRI	SIMULTANEOUS PET-MRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT-MODE; BRAIN NETWORKS; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; CIRCUITS; CORTEX; TASK; FMRI	Functional connectivity (FC) and resting-state network (RSN) analyses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have evolved into a growing field of research and have provided useful biomarkers for the assessment of brain function in neurological disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms of the blood oxygen level-dependant (BOLD) signal are not fully resolved due to its inherent complexity. In contrast, [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([F-18]FDG-PET) has been shown to provide a more direct measure of local synaptic activity and may have additional value for the readout and interpretation of brain connectivity. We performed an RSN analysis from simultaneously acquired PET/fMRI data on a single-subject level to directly compare fMRI and [F-18]FDG-PET-derived networks during the resting state. Simultaneous [F-18]FDG-PET/fMRI scans were performed in 30 rats. Pairwise correlation analysis, as well as independent component analysis (ICA), were used to compare the readouts of both methods. We identified three RSNs with a high degree of similarity between PET and fMRI-derived readouts: the default-mode-like network (DMN), the basal ganglia network and the cerebellar-midbrain network. Overall, [F-18]FDG connectivity indicated increased integration between different, often distant, brain areas compared to the results indicated by the more segregated fMRIderived FC. Additionally, several networks exclusive to either modality were observed using ICA. These networks included mainly bilateral cortical networks of a limited spatial extent for fMRI and more spatially widespread networks for [F-18]FDG-PET, often involving several subcortical areas. This is the first study using simultaneous PET/fMRI to report RSNs subject-wise from dynamic [F-18]FDG tracer delivery and BOLD fluctuations with both independent component analysis (ICA) and pairwise correlation analysis in small animals. Our findings support previous studies, which show a close link between local synaptic glucose consumption and BOLD-fMRI-derived FC. However, several brain regions were exclusively attributed to either [F-18]FDG or BOLD-derived networks underlining the complementarity of this hybrid imaging approach, which may contribute to the understanding of brain functional organization and could be of interest for future clinical applications.

The loud acoustic noise not only affects the activation of the auditory cortex, but may also interfere with resting state and task fMRI experiments. Purpose To demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, quiet, T-2*, whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-fMRI method, termed Looping Star, compared to conventional multislice gradient-echo EPI. Study Type Prospective. Phantom/Subjects Glover stability QA phantom; 10 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence 3.0T: gradient echo (GE)-EPI and T-2* Looping Star fMRI. Assessment Looping Star fMRI was presented and compared to GE-EPI with a working memory (WM) task and resting state (RS) experiments. Temporal stability and acoustic measurements were obtained for both methods. Functional maps and activation accuracy were compared to evaluate the performance of the novel sequence. Statistical Tests Mean and standard deviation values were analyzed for temporal stability and acoustic noise tests. Activation maps were assessed with one-sample t-tests and contrast estimates (CE). Paired t-tests and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) were used to compare fMRI sensitivity and performance. Results Looping Star presented a 98% reduction in sound pressure compared with GE-EPI, with stable temporal stability (0.09% percent fluctuation), but reduced temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) (mean difference = 15.9%). The novel method yielded consistent activations for RS and WM (83.4% and 69.5% relative BOLD sensitivity), which increased with task difficulty (mean CE 2-back = 0.56 vs. 0-back = 0.08, P < 0.05). A few differences in spatial activations were found between sequences, leading to a 4-8% lower activation accuracy with Looping Star. Data Conclusion Looping Star provides a suitable approach for whole-brain coverage with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and BOLD sensitivity, with only 0.5 dB above ambient noise. From the comparison with GE-EPI, further developments of Looping Star fMRI should target increased sensitivity and spatial specificity for both RS and task experiments. Level of Evidence 2.

It is also informing us of therapeutic interventions that will come about with such development. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder in which functional changes may precede structural ones and which may be detectable using existing modalities. Methods: Functional connectivity analysis using electroencephalography (EEG) and resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has provided such meaningful input in cases of epilepsy. By leveraging the potential of autonomic edge computing in epilepsy, we develop and deploy both noninvasive and invasive methods for monitoring, evaluation, and regulation of the epileptic brain. First, an autonomic edge computing framework is proposed for the processing of big data as part of a decision support system for surgical candidacy. Second, a multimodal data analysis using independently acquired EEG and rs-fMRI is presented for estimation and prediction of the epileptogenic network. Third, an unsupervised feature extraction model is developed for EEG analysis and seizure prediction based on a Convolutional deep learning (CNN) structure for distinguishing preictal (pre-seizure) state from non-preictal periods by support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results: Experimental and simulation results from actual patient data validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Conclusions: The combination of rs-fMRI and EEG/iEEG can reveal more information about dynamic functional connectivity. However, simultaneous fMRI and EEG data acquisition present challenges. We have proposed system models for leveraging and processing independently acquired fMRI and EEG data.

Baby Brains at Work: How Task-Based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Can Illuminate the Early Emergence of Psychiatric Risk	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							SENSITIVE PERIODS; INFANT FMRI; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; ANXIETY; LANGUAGE; DISORDERS; STIMULI; STRESS; SYSTEM; VOICE	Psychiatric disorders are complex, often emerging from multiple atypical processes within specified domains over the course of development. Characterizing the development of the neural circuits supporting these domains may help break down the components of complex disorders and reveal variations in functioning associated with psychiatric risk. This review highlights the current and potential role of infant task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in elucidating the developmental neurobiology of psychiatric disorders. Task-fMRI measures evoked brain activity in response to specific stimuli through changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal. First, we review extant studies using task fMRI from birth through the first few years of life and synthesize current evidence for when, where, and how different neural computations are performed across the infant brain. Neural circuits for sensory perception, the perception of abstract categories, and the detection of statistical regularities have been characterized with task fMRI in infants, providing developmental context for identifying and interpreting variation in the functioning of neural circuits related to psychiatric risk. Next, we discuss studies that specifically examine variation in the functioning of these neural circuits during infancy in relation to risk for psychiatric disorders. These studies reveal when maturation of specific neural circuits diverges, the influence of environmental risk factors, and the potential utility for task fMRI to facilitate early treatment or prevention of later psychiatric problems. Finally, we provide con-siderations for future infant task-fMRI studies with the potential to advance understanding of both functioning of neural circuits during infancy and subsequent risk for psychiatric disorders.

The assessable analysis for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is rationally challenging due to the limitations of publicly available datasets. For diagnostic or prognostic tools, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) exposed affirmation to the biomarkers in neuroimaging research because of fMRI pickup inherent connectivity between the brain and regions. There are profound studies in ASD with introducing machine learning or deep learning methods that have manifested advanced steps for ASD predictions based on fMRI data. However, utmost antecedent models have an inadequacy in their capacity to manipulate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To overcome these problems, we proposed an avant-garde DarkASDNet, which has the competence to extract features from a lower level to a higher level and bring out promising results. In this work, we considered 3D fMRI data to predict binary classification between ASD and typical control (TC). Firstly, we pre-processed the 3D fMRI data by adopting proper slice time correction and normalization. Then, we introduced a novel DarkASDNet which surpassed the benchmark accuracy for the classification of ASD. Our model's outcomes unveil that our proposed method established state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.70% to classify ASD vs. TC in ABIDE-I, NYU dataset. Finally, we contemplated our model by performing evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC score, and legitimize by distinguishing with recent literature descriptions to vindicate our outcomes. The proposed DarkASDNet architecture provides a novel benchmark approach for ASD classification using fMRI processed data.

However, subcortical arousal systems have a major influence on dynamic cortical state. We hypothesize that task-related increases in attention begin with a "pulse" in subcortical arousal and cortical attention networks, which are reflected indirectly through transient fMRI signals. We conducted general linear model and model-free analyses of fMRI data from two cohorts and tasks with mixed block and event-related design. 46 adolescent subjects at our center and 362 normal adults from the Human Connectome Project participated. We identified a core shared network of transient fMRI increases in subcortical arousal and cortical salience/attention networks across cohorts and tasks. Specifically, we observed a transient pulse of fMRI increases both at task block onset and with individual task events in subcortical arousal areas including midbrain tegmentum, thalamus, nucleus basalis and striatum; cortical-subcortical salience network regions including the anterior insula/claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area; in dorsal attention network regions including dorsolateral frontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule; as well as in motor regions including cerebellum, and left hemisphere hand primary motor cortex. The transient pulse of fMRI increases in subcortical and cortical arousal and attention networks was consistent across tasks and study populations, whereas sustained activity in these same networks was more variable. The function of the transient pulse in these networks is unknown. However, given its anatomical distribution, it could participate in a neuromodulatory surge of activity in multiple parallel neurotransmitter systems facilitating dynamic changes in conscious attention.

However, as fMRI data acquisition is time-consuming and expensive, the number of samples is usually small in the existing fMRI datasets. It is difficult to build an accurate brain decoding model for a subject with insufficient fMRI data. The majority of semantic decoding methods focus on designing predictive model with limited samples, while less attention is paid to fMRI data augmentation. Leveraging data from related but different subjects can be regarded as a new strategy to improve the performance of predictive model. There are two challenges when using information from different subjects: 1) feature mismatch; 2) distribution mismatch. In this paper, we propose a multi-subject fMRI data augmentation method to address the above two challenges, which can improve the decoding accuracy of the target subject. Specifically, the subject information can be translated from one to another by using multiple subject-specific encoders, decoders and discriminators. The encoder maps each subject to a shared latent space, solving the feature mismatch problem. The decoders and discriminators form multiple generative adversarial network architectures, which solves the distribution mismatch problem. Meanwhile, to ensure that the representation of the latent space preserves information of the input space, our method not only minimizes the local data reconstruction loss, but also preserves the sparse reconstruction (semantic) relation over the whole dataset of the input space. Extensive experiments on three fMRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Resection of the lesion is one solution for that, but presurgical planning (PSP) is needed to guide the surgery for maximum removal of the lesion, as well as maximum preservation of the function. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the best approaches for such a purpose, but performing an fMRI study needs careful consideration of the factors which influence its results. Studies have shown that mental fatigue does have the potential to alter brain functions, and therefore this study aims to identify if mental fatigue should also be considered as a confounding factor when performing an fMRI study, particularly for clinical purposes. Patients and methods: Using 57 healthy young volunteers, face and word encoding tasks were performed, with half of the participants performing the memory tasks after a set of language tasks and half of them before that. Results: The results showed that mental fatigue led to increased activity in the bilateral thalamus and caudate in the face encoding task, and in the right thalamus, posterior cingulate and medial temporal lobe in word encoding. In addition, activation was declined with mental fatigue in the left lingual, precuneus, and posterior cingulate gyri in face encoding. Conclusion: This study has shown the importance of the number and sequence of cognitive/mental tasks when performing an fMRI study, which could help to obtain more reliable fMRI maps in clinical applications. This finding is also important for performing research/cognitive studies using fMRI.

While the usefulness of fQSM with General Linear Model and "On/Off" paradigms has been assessed, little is known about the potential applications and limitations of this technique in more sophisticated experimental paradigms and analyses, such as those currently used in modern neuroimaging. To thoroughly characterize fQSM activations, here we used 7T MRI, tonotopic mapping, as well as univariate (i.e., GLM and population Receptive Field) and multivariate (Representational Similarity Analysis; RSA) analyses. Although fQSM detected less tone-responsive voxels than fMRI, they were more consistently localized in gray matter. Also, the majority of active gray matter voxels exhibited negative fQSM response, signaling the expected oxyhemoglobin increase, whereas positive fQSM activations were mainly in white matter. Though fMRI-and fQSM-based tonotopic maps were overall comparable, the representation of frequency tunings in tone-sensitive regions was significantly more balanced for fQSM. Lastly, RSA revealed that frequency information from the auditory cortex could be successfully retrieved by using either methods. Overall, fQSM produces complementary results to conventional fMRI, as it captures small-scale variations in the activation pattern which inform multivariate measures. Although positive fQSM responses deserve further investigation, they do not impair the interpretation of contrasts of interest. The quantitative nature of fQSM, its spatial specificity and the possibility to simultaneously acquire canonical fMRI support the use of this technique for longitudinal and multicentric studies and pre-surgical mapping.

Gradient self-weighting linear collaborative discriminant regression classification for human cognitive states classification	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; k-nearest neighbors; Linear collaborative discriminant regression classification; Region of interest	FMRI DATA; BRAIN; NETWORKS; ENSEMBLE; ACTIVATION; RESOLUTION; SELECTION; MACHINE	In recent decades, huge volumes of data are available to inspect human brain activities for disease detection. Specifically, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool to enquire the brain functions. In fMRI, identifying the active patterns of the specific cognitive state is one of the emerging concerns for neuroscientists. The high-dimensional features make fMRI data difficult for mining and classification, because if the volume of the data space increases, then the acquired data become sparse, which leads to the "curse of dimensionality" problem. To address this concern, a new feature selection and classification methodology was proposed for classifying the human cognitive states from fMRI data. Initially, the fMRI data were collected from the StarPlus and Haxby datasets. Then, k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)-based genetic algorithm was developed to choose the optimal voxels from the active region of interests. The proposed approach selects the data to feature subsets based on k-NN algorithm, so the data volume was effectively reduced and the voxel information was maintained significantly. The most informative voxels were given as the input for gradient self-weighting that produces an optimal weight value. Respective weight value was added to the projection matrix of linear collaborative discriminant regression classification for identifying the future projection matrix that reduces the error between two individual voxels in subspace. The experimental outcome shows that the proposed methodology improved the accuracy in fMRI data classification up to 0.7-23% compared to the existing methods.	[Gupta, K.

Neural evidence for non-orofacial triggers in mild misophonia	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						misophonia; resting-state connectivity; fMRI; sensorimotor cortex; orofacial; finger-tapping	PLANUM TEMPORALE; SYSTEMS; MOTOR; PARCELLATION; DISORDER; CORTICES; SOUNDS; CORTEX	Misophonia, an extreme aversion to certain environmental sounds, is a highly prevalent yet understudied condition plaguing roughly 20% of the general population. Although neuroimaging research on misophonia is scant, recent work showing higher resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI) between auditory cortex and orofacial motor cortex in misophonia vs. controls has led researchers to speculate that misophonia is caused by orofacial mirror neurons. Since orofacial motor cortex was defined using rs-fMRI, we attempted to theoretically replicate these findings using orofacial cortex defined by task-based fMRI instead. Further, given our recent work showing that a wide variety of sounds can be triggering (i.e., not just oral/nasal sounds), we investigated whether there is any neural evidence for misophonic aversion to non-orofacial stimuli. Sampling 19 adults with varying misophonia from the community, we collected resting state data and an fMRI task involving phoneme articulation and finger-tapping. We first defined "orofacial" cortex in each participant using rs-fMRI as done previously, producing what we call resting-state regions of interest (rsROIs). Additionally, we functionally defined regions (fROIs) representing "orofacial" or "finger" cortex using phoneme or finger-tapping activation from the fMRI task, respectively. To investigate the motor specificity of connectivity differences, we subdivided the rsROIs and fROIs into separate sensorimotor areas based on their overlap with two common atlases. We then calculated rs-fMRI between each rsROI/fROI and a priori non-sensorimotor ROIs. We found increased connectivity in mild misophonia between rsROIs and both auditory cortex and insula, theoretically replicating previous results, with differences extending across multiple sensorimotor regions. However, the orofacial task-based fROIs did not show this pattern, suggesting the "orofacial" cortex described previously was not capturing true orofacial cortex; in fact, using task-based fMRI evidence, we find no selectivity to orofacial action in these previously described "orofacial" regions. Instead, we observed higher connectivity between finger fROIs and insula in mild misophonia, demonstrating neural evidence for non-orofacial triggers. These results provide support for a neural representation of misophonia beyond merely an orofacial/motor origin, leading to important implications for the conceptualization and treatment of misophonia.

The echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence is the most common choice for fMRI investigations, but it has several shortcomings. EPI is one of the loudest sequences and very prone to movement and susceptibility-induced artefacts, making it suboptimal for awake imaging. Additionally, the fast gradient-switching of EPI induces disrupting currents in simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. Therefore, we investigated whether the unique features of Multi-Band SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation (MB-SWIFT) overcome these issues at a high 9.4 T magnetic field, making it a potential alternative to EPI. MB-SWIFT had 32-dB and 20-dB lower peak and average sound pressure levels, respectively, than EPI with typical fMRI parameters. Body movements had little to no effect on MB-SWIFT images or functional connectivity analyses, whereas they severely affected EPI data. The minimal gradient steps of MB-SWIFT induced significantly lower currents in simultaneous electrophysiological recordings than EPI, and there were no electrode-induced distortions in MB-SWIFT images. An independent component analysis of the awake rat functional connectivity data obtained with MB-SWIFT resulted in near whole-brain level functional parcellation, and simultaneous electrophysiological and fMRI measurements in isoflurane-anesthetized rats indicated that MB-SWIFT signal is tightly linked to neuronal resting-state activity. Therefore, we conclude that the MB-SWIFT sequence is a robust preclinical brain mapping tool that can overcome many of the drawbacks of conventional EPI fMRI at high magnetic fields.

Iron content affects age group differences in associative learning-related fMRI activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Iron; fMRI; Aging; Basal ganglia; Hippocampus	SUSCEPTIBILITY MAPPING QSM; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; BASAL GANGLIA; WORKING-MEMORY; OLDER-ADULTS; HUMAN BRAIN; IMPLICIT; DEPOSITION; STRIATUM; PREDICTS	Brain regions accumulate different amounts of iron with age, with older adults having higher iron in the basal ganglia (globus pallidus, putamen, caudate) relative to the hippocampus. This has important implications for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in aging as the presence of iron may influence both neuronal functioning as well as the measured fMRI (BOLD) signal, and these effects will vary across age groups and brain regions. To test this hypothesis, the current study examined the effect of iron on age group differences in task-related activity within each basal nuclei and the hippocampus. Twenty-eight younger and 22 older adults completed an associative learning task during fMRI acquisition. Iron content (QSM, R2*) was estimated from a multi-echo gradient echo sequence. As previously reported, older adults learned significantly less than younger adults and age group differences in iron content were largest in the basal ganglia (putamen, caudate). In the hippocampus (early task stage) and globus pallidus (late task stage), older adults had significantly higher learning-related activity than younger adults both before and after controlling for iron. In the putamen (late task stage), however, younger adults had significantly higher learning-related activity than older adults that was only seen after controlling for iron. These findings support the notion that age-related differences in iron influence both neuronal functioning and the measured fMRI signal in select basal nuclei.

However, fundamental unresolved questions remain related to the influence of neurovascular coupling (NVC) maturation on functional responses in early development. We aimed to probe the feasibility and compare the responses to multiple sensory stimulations in newborns with PA using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods: Responses to visual, auditory, and sensorimotor passive stimulation were measured with fMRI and fNIRS and compared in 18 term newborns with PA and six controls. Results: Most newborns exhibited a positive fMRI response during visual and sensorimotor stimulation, higher in the sensorimotor. An asymmetric pattern (negative in the left hemisphere) was observed in auditory stimulation. The fNIRS response most resembling the adult pattern (positive) in PA occurred during auditory stimulation, in which oxyhemoglobin (HbO) increased, and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) decreased. Significative differences were found in the HbO and HbR profiles in newborns with PA compared to the controls, more evident in auditory stimulation. Positive correlations between the fMRI BOLD signal and at least one fNIRS channel (HbO) in all stimuli in newborns with PA were identified: the strongest was in the auditory (r=0.704) and the weakest in the sensorimotor (r=0.544); in more fNIRS channels, in the visual. Conclusions: Both techniques are feasible physiological assessment tools, suggesting a distinctive level of maturation in sensory and motor areas. Differences in fNIRS profiles in newborns with PA and controls and the fMRI-fNIRS relationship observed can encourage the fNIRS as a clinically emergent valuable tool.

In general, it can extract more information than separate analyses can. Jointly analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements has been proved to be highly beneficial to the study of the brain function, mainly because these neuroimaging modalities have complementary spatiotemporal resolution: EEG offers good temporal resolution while fMRI is better in its spatial resolution. The EEG-fMRI fusion methods that have been reported so far ignore the underlying multiway nature of the data in at least one of the modalities and/or rely on very strong assumptions concerning the relation of the respective datasets. For example, in multisubject analysis, it is commonly assumed that the hemodynamic response function is a priori known for all subjects and/or the coupling across corresponding modes is assumed to be exact (hard). In this article, these two limitations are overcome by adopting tensor models for both modalities and by following soft and flexible coupling approaches to implement the multimodal fusion. The obtained results are compared against those of parallel independent component analysis and hard coupling alternatives, with both synthetic and real data (epilepsy and visual oddball paradigm). Our results demonstrate the clear advantage of using soft and flexible coupled tensor decompositions in scenarios that do not conform with the hard coupling assumption.

Both magnetic source imaging (MSI), and the more recent EEG-correlated functional MRI (EEG-fMRI), have shown applicability in assisting surgical planning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capability of each method and their combination in localizing the seizure onset lobe (SL). METHODS The study included 14 patients who underwent both MSI and EEG-fMRI before undergoing implantation of intracranial EEG (icEEG) as part of the presurgical planning of the resection of an epileptogenic zone (EZ) during the years 2012-2018. The estimated location of the SL by each method was compared with the location determined by icEEG. Identification rates of the SL were compared between the different methods. RESULTS MSI and EEG-fMRI showed similar identification rates of SL locations in relation to icEEG results (88% +/- 31% and 73% +/- 42%, respectively; p = 0.281). The additive use of the coverage lobes of both methods correctly identified 100% of the SL, significantly higher than EEG-fMRI alone (p = 0.039) and nonsignificantly higher than MSI (p = 0.180). False-identification rates of the additive coverage lobes were significantly higher than MSI (p = 0.026) and EEGfMRI (p = 0.027). The intersecting lobes of both methods showed the lowest false identification rate (13% +/- 6%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Both MSI and EEG-fMRI can assist in the presurgical evaluation of patients with refractory epilepsy. The additive use of both tests confers a high identification rate in finding the SL. This combination can help in focusing implantation of icEEG electrodes targeting the SOZ.

However, there have been few studies demonstrating the dose relationship of the fMRI response induced by CNS drugs to underlying target engagement or behavioral efficacy. To clarify these relationships, we examined receptor occupancy measurements using positron emission tomography (PET) (n = 3 similar to 5), fMRI (n = 5 similar to 8) and a cataleptic behavior (n = 6) with raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (8, 20, and 200 mu g/kg) on Wistar rats. Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy was increased dose dependently by raclopride (41.8 +/- 2.7%, 8 mu g/kg; 64.9 +/- 2.8%, 20 mu g/kg; 83.1 +/- 3.0%, 200 mu g/kg). phMRI study revealed significant positive responses to raclopride at 200 mu g/kg specifically in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, related to dopaminergic system. Slight fMRI responses were observed at 20 mu g/kg in some areas corresponding to the striatum and nucleus accumbens. There were no noticeable fMRI responses at 8 mu g/kg raclopride administration. Raclopride at 200 mu g/kg significantly increased the cataleptic score, although, at 8 and 20 mu g/kg, raclopride had no significant effects. These findings showed that raclopride-induced fMRI responses were observed at doses inducing cataleptic behavior and high D2 receptor occupancy, suggesting that phMRI can be useful for dose selection in clinical trial as an evaluation method of brain activity, which reflects behavioral responses induced by target engagements.

Brain-wide networks of sensory processing are difficult to investigate due to their dynamic regulation by multiple brain circuits.

Brain tumors induce language reorganization, which may influence the extent of resection in surgical planning. Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) allows definitive language mapping during awake surgery by locating areas of speech arrest (SA) surrounding the tumor. Although functional MRI (fMRI) combined with graph theory analysis can illustrate whole-brain network reorganization, few studies have corroborated these findings with DCS intraoperative mapping and clinical language performance. OBJECTIVE. We evaluated whether patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) without SA during DCS show increased right-hemispheric connections and better speech performance compared with patients with SA. METHODS. We retrospectively recruited 44 consecutive patients with left perisylvian LGG, preoperative language task-based fMRI, speech performance evaluation, and awake surgery with DCS. We generated language networks from ROIs corresponding to known language areas (i.e., language core) on fMRI using optimal percolation. Language core connectivity in the left and right hemispheres was quantified as fMRI laterality index (LI) and connectivity LI on the basis of fMRI activation maps and connectivity matrices. We compared fMRI LI and connectivity LI between patients with SA and without SA and used multivariable logistic regression (p < .05) to assess associations between DCS and connectivity LI, fMRI LI, tumor location, Broca area and Wernicke area involvement, prior treatments, age, handedness, sex, tumor size, and speech deficit before surgery, within 1 week after surgery, and 3-6 months after surgery. RESULTS. Patients with SA showed left-dominant connectivity; patients without SA lateralized more to the right hemisphere (p < .001). Between patients with SA and those without, fMRI LI was not significantly different. Patients without SA showed right-greater-than-left connectivity of Broca area and premotor area compared with patients with SA. Regression analysis showed significant association between no SA and right-lateralized connectivity LI (p < .001) and fewer speech deficits before (p < .001) and 1 week after (p = .02) surgery. CONCLUSION. Patients without SA had increased right-hemispheric connections and right translocation of the language core, suggesting language reorganization. Lack of interoperative SA was associated with fewer speech deficits both before and immediately after surgery. CLINICAL IMPACT. These findings support tumor-induced language plasticity as a compensatory mechanism, which may lead to fewer postsurgical deficits and allow extended resection.

Furthermore, based on key global graph-theoretic properties of the embedded FCN, we compare their classification potential using machine learning. We also assess the performance of two metrics that are widely used for the construction of FCN from fMRI, namely the Euclidean distance and the cross correlation metric. We show that diffusion maps with the cross correlation metric outperform the other combinations.

Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings offer a high spatiotemporal resolution approach to study human brain and understand the underlying mechanisms mediating cognitive and behavioral processes. However, the high susceptibility of EEG to MRI-induced artifacts hinders a broad adaptation of this approach. More specifically, EEG data collected during fMRI acquisition are contaminated with MRI gradients and ballistocardiogram artifacts, in addition to artifacts of physiological origin. There have been several attempts for reducing these artifacts with manual and time-consuming pre-processing, which may result in biasing EEG data due to variations in selecting steps order, parameters, and classification of artifactual independent components. Thus, there is a strong urge to develop a fully automatic and comprehensive pipeline for reducing all major EEG artifacts. In this work, we introduced an open-access toolbox with a fully automatic pipeline for reducing artifacts from EEG data collected simultaneously with fMRI (refer to APPEAR). Approach. The pipeline integrates average template subtraction and independent component analysis to suppress both MRI-related and physiological artifacts. To validate our results, we tested APPEAR on EEG data recorded from healthy control subjects during resting-state (n= 48) and task-based (i.e. event-related-potentials (ERPs); n= 8) paradigms. The chosen gold standard is an expert manual review of the EEG database. Main results. We compared manually and automated corrected EEG data during resting-state using frequency analysis and continuous wavelet transformation and found no significant differences between the two corrections. A comparison between ERP data recorded during a so-called stop-signal task (e.g. amplitude measures and signal-to-noise ratio) also showed no differences between the manually and fully automatic fMRI-EEG-corrected data. Significance. APPEAR offers the first comprehensive open-source toolbox that can speed up advancement of EEG analysis and enhance replication by avoiding experimenters' preferences while allowing for processing large EEG-fMRI cohorts composed of hundreds of subjects with manageable researcher time and effort.

Graded fMRI Neurofeedback Training of Motor Imagery in Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke Patients: A Preregistered Proof-of-Concept Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; neurofeedback; stroke; preregistration; rehabilitation	RESONANCE-IMAGING NEUROFEEDBACK; REAL-TIME FMRI; MEASURING VASCULAR REACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SUBCORTICAL STROKE; MENTAL PRACTICE; NETWORK; RECOVERY; PREVALENCE; MODULATION	Ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a major brain vessel that supplies the primary motor and premotor cortex, is one of the most common causes for severe upper limb impairment. Currently available motor rehabilitation training largely lacks satisfying efficacy with over 70% of stroke survivors showing residual upper limb dysfunction. Motor imagery-based functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic technique to improve motor impairment in stroke survivors. In this preregistered proof-of-concept study (https://osf.io/y69jc/), we translated graded fMRI-NF training, a new paradigm that we have previously studied in healthy participants, to first-time MCA stroke survivors with residual mild to severe impairment of upper limb motor function. Neurofeedback was provided from the supplementary motor area (SMA) targeting two different neurofeedback target levels (low and high). We hypothesized that MCA stroke survivors will show (1) sustained SMA-region of interest (ROI) activation and (2) a difference in SMA-ROI activation between low and high neurofeedback conditions during graded fMRI-NF training. At the group level, we found only anecdotal evidence for these preregistered hypotheses. At the individual level, we found anecdotal to moderate evidence for the absence of the hypothesized graded effect for most subjects. These null findings are relevant for future attempts to employ fMRI-NF training in stroke survivors. The study introduces a Bayesian sequential sampling plan, which incorporates prior knowledge, yielding higher sensitivity. The sampling plan was preregistered together witha priorihypotheses and all planned analysis before data collection to address potential publication/researcher biases. Unforeseen difficulties in the translation of our paradigm to a clinical setting required some deviations from the preregistered protocol. We explicitly detail these changes, discuss the accompanied additional challenges that can arise in clinical neurofeedback studies, and formulate recommendations for how these can be addressed. Taken together, this work provides new insights about the feasibility of motor imagery-based graded fMRI-NF training in MCA stroke survivors and serves as a first example for comprehensive study preregistration of an (fMRI) neurofeedback experiment.

Quality control practices in FMRI analysis: Philosophy, methods and examples using AFNI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						FMRI; quality control; AFNI; resting state; reproducibility; processing; data visualization; task-based	VISUALIZATION	Quality control (QC) is a necessary, but often an under-appreciated, part of FMRI processing. Here we describe procedures for performing QC on acquired or publicly available FMRI datasets using the widely used AFNI software package. This work is part of the Research Topic, "Demonstrating Quality Control (QC) Procedures in fMRI. " We used a sequential, hierarchical approach that contained the following major stages: (1) GTKYD (getting to know your data, esp. its basic acquisition properties), (2) APQUANT (examining quantifiable measures, with thresholds), (3) APQUAL (viewing qualitative images, graphs, and other information in systematic HTML reports) and (4) GUI (checking features interactively with a graphical user interface); and for task data, and (5) STIM (checking stimulus event timing statistics). We describe how these are complementary and reinforce each other to help researchers stay close to their data. We processed and evaluated the provided, publicly available resting state data collections (7 groups, 139 total subjects) and task-based data collection (1 group, 30 subjects). As specified within the Topic guidelines, each subject's dataset was placed into one of three categories: Include, exclude or uncertain. The main focus of this paper, however, is the detailed description of QC procedures: How to understand the contents of an FMRI dataset, to check its contents for appropriateness, to verify processing steps, and to examine potential quality issues. Scripts for the processing and analysis are freely available.

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), trial-wise response amplitudes are sometimes estimated from the measured signal using a general linear model (GLM) with one onset regressor for each trial. When using rapid event-related designs with trials closely spaced in time, those estimates are highly variable and serially correlated due to the temporally extended shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF). Here, we describe inverse transformed encoding modelling (ITEM), a principled approach of accounting for those serial correlations and decoding from the resulting estimates, at low computational cost and with no loss in statistical power. We use simulated data to show that ITEM outperforms the current standard approach in terms of decoding accuracy and analyze empirical data to demonstrate that ITEM is capable of visual reconstruction from fMRI signals.

The present study used resting state fMRI to investigate resting state network connectivity in a sample of patients with Juvenile Absence Epilepsy. Single-subject manual independent component analysis was used in two levels, whereby all noise components were removed, and cerebrospinal fluid pulsation components only were isolated and removed. Improved temporal signal to noise ratios and functional connectivity metrics were observed in each of the cleaning levels for both epilepsy and control cohorts. Results showed full, single-subject manual independent component analysis reduced the number of functional connectivity correlations and increased the strength of these correlations. Similar effects were also observed for the cerebrospinal fluid pulsation only cleaned data relative to the uncleaned, and fully cleaned data. Single-subject manual independent component analysis coupled with short TR multiband acquisition can significantly improve the validity of findings derived from fMRI data sets.

Preoperative functional neuroimaging, such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has emerged as a possible tool to inform patient selection and surgical planning. However, evidence that preoperative fMRI or DTI improves extent of resection, limits neurological morbidity, and broadens surgical indications in classically eloquent areas is lacking. In this review, the authors describe facets of functional neuroimaging techniques that may limit their impact on neurosurgical oncology and critically evaluate the evidence supporting fMRI and DTI for patient selection and operative planning in glioma surgery. The authors also propose alternative applications for functional neuroimaging in the care of glioma patients.

The neural correlates of state empathy have been deeply investigated, whereas the association between trait empathy and brain activity remains unclear. Thus, this study employed multiple variate pattern analysis (MVPA) to explore whether intrinsic brain activity (IBA) within state-empathy-related regions was associated with trait empathy. Meta-analysis of empathy-related fMRI experiments identified a general network underlying state empathy, which is located in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) extending to the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and left anterior insula (AI) and extending to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The subsequent MVPA found that empathic concern can be predicted through the IBA of the general network at the female individual level (i.e., the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and regional homogeneity). Based on the resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), these results further support the involvement of SMA/MCC and AI/IFG in empathy. Meanwhile, the significant predictive association between IBA and trait empathy offers new insights into the general component of empathy, which may indicate the potential of using rs-fMRI to achieve the objective measurement of empathic ability.

In order to evaluate the evidence of clinical benefits and investigate how consistently studies report their methods and results, an exhaustive search of fMRI neurofeedback studies in clinical populations was performed. Reporting was evaluated using a limited number of Consensus on the reporting and experimental design of clinical and cognitive-behavioral neumfeedback studies (CRED-NF checklist) items, which was, together with a statistical power and sensitivity calculation, used to also evaluate the existing evidence of the neumfeedback benefits on clinical measures. The 62 found studies investigated regulation abilities and/or clinical benefits in a wide range of disorders, but with small sample sizes and were therefore unable to detect small effects. Most points from the CRED-NF checklist were adequately reported by the majority of the studies, but some improvements are suggested for the reporting of group comparisons and relations between regulation success and clinical benefits. To establish fMRI neurofeedback as a clinical tool, more emphasis should be placed in the future on using larger sample sizes determined through a priori power calculations and standardization of procedures and reporting.

Objective measures are essential to characterize the nocturnal sleep disturbance, identify daytime impairment, and determine the course of these symptoms. The aim of this study was to establish a resting-state fMRI-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier to diagnose insomnia disorder. Methods: We enrolled 20 patients with insomnia disorder and 21 healthy controls, and obtained their simultaneous polysomnographic electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings. The SVM classifiers were trained to capture insomnia. Classifier performance was quantified by a 5-fold cross validation and on independent test dataset. Results: The fMRI-based SVM classifier was able to diagnose insomnia with an accuracy of 89.3% (sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 87.7%). The robustness of SVM classifier was encouraging. Conclusions: We established an encouraging resting-state fMRI-based SVM classifier to automatically diagnose insomnia disorder. As an objective measure for assessing insomnia disorder, it would be of additional value to the current self-reported subjective criteria. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unified Retrospective EEG Motion Educated Artefact Suppression for EEG-fMRI to Suppress Magnetic Field Gradient Artefacts During Motion	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Prospective motion correction; EEG-fMRI; Gradient artefacts; Motion induced artefacts	IMAGING-ARTIFACT; REFERENCE LAYER; PULSE ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; RECORDINGS; REDUCTION	The data quality of simultaneously acquired electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) can be strongly affected by motion. Recent work has shown that the quality of fMRI data can be improved by using a Moire-Phase-Tracker (MPT)-camera system for prospective motion correction. The use of the head position acquired by the MPT-camera-system has also been shown to correct motion-induced voltages, ballistocardiogram (BCG) and gradient artefact residuals separately. In this work we show the concept of an integrated framework based on the general linear model to provide a unified motion informed model of in-MRI artefacts. This model (retrospective EEG motion educated gradient artefact suppression, REEG-MEGAS) is capable of correcting voltage-induced, BCG and gradient artefact residuals of EEG data acquired simultaneously with prospective motion corrected fMRI. In our results, we have verified that applying REEG-MEGAS correction to EEG data acquired during subject motion improves the data quality in terms of motion induced voltages and also GA residuals in comparison to standard Artefact Averaging Subtraction and Retrospective EEG Motion Artefact Suppression. Besides that, we provide preliminary evidence that although adding more regressors to a model may slightly affect the power of physiological signals such as the alpha-rhythm, its application may increase the overall quality of a dataset, particularly when strongly affected by motion. This was verified by analysing the EEG traces, power spectra density and the topographic distribution from two healthy subjects. We also have verified that the correction by REEG-MEGAS improves higher frequency artefact correction by decreasing the power of Gradient Artefact harmonics. Our method showed promising results for decreasing the power of artefacts for frequencies up to 250 Hz. Additionally, REEG-MEGAS is a hybrid framework that can be implemented for real time prospective motion correction of EEG and fMRI data. Among other EEG-fMRI applications, the approach described here may benefit applications such as EEG-fMRI neurofeedback and brain computer interface, which strongly rely on the prospective acquisition and application of motion artefact removal.

Biclustering fMRI time series: a comparative study	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Biclustering; fMRI; Neurosciences; Time series analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EXPRESSION DATA; BRAIN; MODEL; ALGORITHMS; PATTERN; CORTEX	Background The effectiveness of biclustering, simultaneous clustering of rows and columns in a data matrix, was shown in gene expression data analysis. Several researchers recognize its potentialities in other research areas. Nevertheless, the last two decades have witnessed the development of a significant number of biclustering algorithms targeting gene expression data analysis and a lack of consistent studies exploring the capacities of biclustering outside this traditional application domain. Results This work evaluates the potential use of biclustering in fMRI time series data, targeting the Region x Time dimensions by comparing seven state-in-the-art biclustering and three traditional clustering algorithms on artificial and real data. It further proposes a methodology for biclustering evaluation beyond gene expression data analysis. The results discuss the use of different search strategies in both artificial and real fMRI time series showed the superiority of exhaustive biclustering approaches, obtaining the most homogeneous biclusters. However, their high computational costs are a challenge, and further work is needed for the efficient use of biclustering in fMRI data analysis. Conclusions This work pinpoints avenues for the use of biclustering in spatio-temporal data analysis, in particular neurosciences applications. The proposed evaluation methodology showed evidence of the effectiveness of biclustering in finding local patterns in fMRI time series data. Further work is needed regarding scalability to promote the application in real scenarios.

Enhancing task fMRI preprocessing via individualized model -based filtering of intrinsic activity dynamics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Task fMRI; Resting state fMRI; Brain dynamics; Causal modeling; Individual differences; Cognitive control	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RULES; MRI; FLUCTUATIONS; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION; CORTEX; TRIAL	Brain responses recorded during fMRI are thought to reflect both rapid, stimulus-evoked activity and the propagation of spontaneous activity through brain networks. In the current work, we describe a method to improve the estimation of task-evoked brain activity by first "filtering-out the intrinsic propagation of pre-event activity from the BOLD signal. We do so using Mesoscale Individualized NeuroDynamic (MINDy; Singh et al. 2020b) models built from individualized resting-state data to subtract the propagation of spontaneous activity from the task-fMRI signal (MINDy-based Filtering). After filtering, time-series are analyzed using conventional techniques. Results demonstrate that this simple operation significantly improves the statistical power and temporal precision of estimated group-level effects. Moreover, use of MINDy-based filtering increased the similarity of neural activation profiles and prediction accuracy of individual differences in behavior across tasks measuring the same construct (cognitive control). Thus, by subtracting the propagation of previous activity, we obtain better estimates of task-related neural effects.

A group of 21 participants was scanned 16 times (4 runs per session, 2 sessions per day, 2 separate days) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. For each run, we calculated t-value and tSNR maps. To ascertain that the results were not specific to the scanner, one volunteer was scanned with four fMRI runs in a single session on the above 3T Philips scanner as well as a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner. The coefficient of variation of voxel-wise tSNR across the 16 repeats was up to 25%, while the range relative to the mean of all observations was up to 80%. The voxel-wise variability of tSNR on the two different scanners was similar, indicating a general issue. Despite its use in evaluating the quality of fMRI data, we found only a weak relationship between tSNR and t-values. There is very high variability in voxel-wise tSNR, which should be considered while planning future studies that aim to identify small and focal fMRI effects or the benefits of incremental improvement in methods.

Selecting the appropriate language to test by fMRI in trilingual patients is intricate. Our objective is to compare fMRI maps for all three languages in left- and right-handed trilingual subjects. 15 right- and 15 left-handed trilingual volunteers were included in the study. We performed fMRI for each volunteer with a visual responsive naming paradigm that was repeated three times, once in each language. The activated areas and the laterality indices were calculated and correlation with the age of acquisition and proficiency of each language was determined. Strong statistical correlation was found between the Laterality Index (LI) of the three languages, in both the right and left-handed groups. Discordant lateralization of language was only observed in four left-handed subjects who demonstrated bilateral and left-lateralization. In right-handed subjects, the activation maps for the first and the second acquired language were similar. The largest activation was seen with the last acquired language. Irrespective of language proficiency and age of acquisition, the language lateralization might change for left-handed subjects. In right-handed subjects, there is no change and the last acquired language results in the largest activation. fMRI performed for a single language can accurately determine language lateralization in right-handed subjects, whereas in left-handed subjects, it is mandatory to test all languages.

Functional MRI (fMRI) is a noninvasive method that is highly concordant with other clinical indicators of language laterality, and is now commonly used to confirm language dominance. However, there is also a high frequency of divergence between fMRI findings and other clinical indices that complicate determination of dominance and surgical decision-making in individual patients. Despite this, divergent cases are rarely published or discussed. This article provides three illustrative examples to demonstrate common scenarios where fMRI may produce conflicting or otherwise difficult-to-interpret findings. We will also discuss potential reasons for divergence and propose a flow-chart to aid clinical decision making in such situations.

Samples in this retrospective study included 17 patients with prior brain surgery and 21 patients without prior surgery (38 patients total; mean age 43.2, SD = 11.9; 18 females; seven left-handed). All the patients were left language dominant, as determined clinically. The two samples were matched on 10 known confounds, including, for example, tumor laterality and location (all tumors affected Brodmann areas 44/45/47). We calculated fMRI language dominance with laterality indices using a whole-brain and region of interest approach (ROI; Broca's and Wernicke's area). Patients with prior surgery had decreased fMRI language dominance (p = 0.03) with more activity in the right hemisphere (p = 0.03) than patients without surgery. Patients with prior brain surgery did not display less language activity in the left hemisphere than patients without surgery. These results were replicated using an ROI approach in the affected Broca's area. Further, we observed no differences between our samples in the unaffected Wernicke's area. In sum, prior brain surgery affecting Broca's area could be a confounding factor that needs to be considered when evaluating fMRI language dominance.

To understand cognition, we need to identify brain responses simultaneously in space and time. Here we present a technique that does this by linking multivariate response patterns of the human brain recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and with magneto- or electroen-cephalography (M/EEG) based on representational similarity. We present the rationale and current applications of this non-invasive analysis technique, termed M/EEG-fMRI fusion, and discuss its pros and cons. We highlight its wide applicability in cognitive neuroscience and how its openness to further development and extension gives it strong potential for a deeper understanding of cognition in the future.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 68 Observational Studies	RADIOLOGY			English	Review							DIFFUSION TENSOR TRACTOGRAPHY; PRIMARY SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; LOW-GRADE GLIOMAS; FIBER TRACKING; ELOQUENT AREAS; CORTICAL STIMULATION; CLINICAL-APPLICATION; CORTICOSPINAL TRACT; VOLUMETRIC-ANALYSIS	Background: Preoperative functional MRI (fMRI) is one of several techniques developed to localize critical brain structures and brain tumors. However, the usefulness of fMRI for preoperative surgical planning and its potential effect on neurologic outcomes remain unclear. Purpose: To assess the overall postoperative morbidity among patients with brain tumors by using preoperative fMRI versus surgery without this tool or with use of standard (nonfunctional) neuronavigation. Materials and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies across major databases from 1946 to June 20, 2020, were conducted. Inclusion criteria were original studies that (a) included patients with brain tumors, (b) performed preoperative neuroimaging workup with fMRI, (c) investigated the usefulness of a preoperative or intraoperative functional neuroimaging technique and used that technique to resect cerebral tumors, and (d) reported postoperative clinical measures. Pooled estimates for adverse event rate (ER) effect size (log ER, log odds ratio, or Hedges g) with 95% CIs were computed by using a random-effects model. Results: Sixty-eight studies met eligibility criteria (3280 participants; 58.9% men [1555 of 2641]; mean age, 46 years 6 8 [standard deviation]). Functional deterioration after surgical procedure was less likely to occur when fMRI mapping was performed before the operation (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.53; P < .001]), and postsurgical Karnofsky performance status scores were higher in patients who underwent fMRI mapping (Hedges g, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.21, 1.11; P =.004]). Craniotomies for tumor resection performed with preoperative fMRI were associated with a pooled adverse ER of 11% (95% CI: 8.4, 13.1), compared with a 21.0% ER (95% CI: 12.2, 33.5) in patients who did not undergo fMRI mapping. Conclusion: From the currently available data, the benefit of preoperative functional MRI planning for the resection of brain tumors appears to reduce postsurgical morbidity, especially when used with other advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion-tensor imaging, intraoperative MRI, or cortical stimulation.

Purpose: To evaluate the potential impact of PA upon fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the periphery of AVMs. Study Type: Prospective. Population: Twenty-one patients with AVMs located in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) undergoing task-based fMRI (hand motor), and 19 patients with supratentorial AVMs undergoing resting-state fMRI. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T, echo-planar, time-of-flight, and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo. Assessment: The presence of PA was determined by three observers (Y.C., J.W., and X.C.) according to digital subtraction angiography and MR angiography. Interhemispheric asymmetry of fMRI activations contralateral to hand movements was evaluated with the interhemispheric ratio of the average t-value within ipsilesional SM1 to contralesional SM1. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) were extracted from ring-shaped perinidal regions and contralateral homologous regions, and the corresponding interhemispheric ratios were calculated. The effect of PA on the interhemispheric asymmetry of motor activations, ReHo, and fALFF was estimated. Statistical Tests: Pearson analysis, paired and independent t-test, multiple linear regression, Friedman test, and factorial analysis of variance were used. Results: Motor activations were significantly reduced in ipsilesional SM1 compared to contralesional SM1 (P < 0.05). The presence of PA was the independent predictor of activation loss in ipsilateral SM1(P < 0.05). Furthermore, perinidal regions exhibited reduced ReHo compared to the homologous regions (P < 0.05). PA was significantly associated with the decline of ReHo and fALFF in perinidal regions (P < 0.05, for both). Data Conclusion: The presence of PA can predict perinidal NVU that may confound the interpretation of both task-based and resting-state fMRI, highlighting the importance of alternative approaches of brain functional localization in improving treatment of AVMs.	[Li, Maogui; Liu, Qingyuan; Guo, Rui; Yang, Shuzhe; Jiang, Pengjun; Chen, Xin; Wu, Jun; Cao, Yong; Wang, Shuo] Capital Med Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Beijing Tiantan Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Maogui; Liu, Qingyuan; Guo, Rui; Yang, Shuzhe; Jiang, Pengjun; Chen, Xin; Wu, Jun; Cao, Yong; Wang, Shuo] China Natl Clin Res Ctr Neurol Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Maogui; Liu, Qingyuan; Guo, Rui; Yang, Shuzhe; Jiang, Pengjun; Chen, Xin; Wu, Jun; Cao, Yong; Wang, Shuo] Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Ctr Stroke, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Maogui; Liu, Qingyuan; Guo, Rui; Yang, Shuzhe; Jiang, Pengjun; Chen, Xin; Wu, Jun; Cao, Yong; Wang, Shuo] Beijing Key Lab Translat Med Cerebrovasc Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China	Capital Medical University	Wang, S (corresponding author), Beijing Tiantan Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, 119 South Fourth Ring Rd West, Beijing, Peoples R China.	captain9858@ccmu.edu.cn	Liu, Qingyuan/JXM-7893-2024; Zhang, Yiyang/HZI-3668-2023		Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project [D161100003816006]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1301800]	Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project; National Key Research and Development Program of China	Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project; Contract grant number: D161100003816006; Contract grant sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China; Contract grant number: 2016YFC1301800.		40	1	1	0	2	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1053-1807	1522-2586		J MAGN RESON IMAGING	J.

With global health research focusing on aging, several open fMRI datasets have been made available that combine deep learning with big data and are a new, promising trend and open issue for brain information detection in fMRI studies of brain aging. In this study, we proposed a new method based on deep learning from the perspective of big data, named Deep neural network (DNN) with Autoencoder (AE) pretrained Functional connectivity Analysis (DAFA), to deeply mine the important functional connectivity changes in fMRI during brain aging. First, using resting-state fMRI data from 421 subjects from the CamCAN dataset, functional connectivities were calculated using sliding window method, and the complex functional patterns were mined by an AE. Then, to increase the statistical power and reliability of the results, we used an AE-pretrained DNN to relabel the functional connectivities of each subject to classify them as belonging to the attributes of young or old individuals. A method called search-back analysis was performed to find alterations in brain function during aging according to the relabeled functional connectivities. Finally, behavioral data regarding fluid intelligence and response time were used to verify the revealed functional changes. Compared to traditional methods, DAFA revealed additional, important aged-related changes in FC patterns [e.g., FC connections within the default mode (DMN) and the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as connections between the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks, between the DMN and the frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular/sensorimotor/occipital/cerebellum networks, and between the sensorimotor and frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular networks], which were correlated to behavioral data. These findings demonstrated that the proposed DAFA method was superior to traditional FC-determining methods in discovering changes in brain functional connectivity during aging.

To further advance understanding of brain functions, it is critical to understand the direction of information flow, such as thalamocortical versus corticothalamic projections. For this work, we performed ultrahigh spatiotemporal resolution fMRI at 15.2 T of the mouse somatosensory network during forepaw somatosensory stimulation and optogenetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1). Somatosensory stimulation induced the earliest BOLD response in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL), followed by the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and then M1 and posterior thalamic nucleus. Optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons in M1 induced the earliest BOLD response in M1, followed by S1 and then VPL. Within S1, the middle cortical layers responded to somatosensory stimulation earlier than the upper or lower layers, whereas the upper cortical layers responded earlier than the other two layers to optogenetic stimulation in M1. The order of early BOLD responses was consistent with the canonical understanding of somatosensory network connections and cannot be explained by regional variabilities in the hemodynamic response functions measured using hypercapnic stimulation. Our data demonstrate that early BOLD responses reflect the information flow in the mouse somatosensory network, suggesting that high-field fMRI can be used for systems-level network analyses.

The HRF, modulated by several non-neural factors, is variable across brain regions, individuals and populations. Yet, a majority of human resting-state fMRI connectivity studies continue to assume a non-variable HRF. In this article, with supportive prior evidence, we argue that HRF variability cannot be ignored as it substantially confounds within-subject connectivity estimates and between-subjects connectivity group differences. We also discuss its clinical relevance with connectivity impairments confounded by HRF aberrations in several disorders. We present limited data on HRF differences between women and men, which resulted in a 15.4% median error in functional connectivity estimates in a group-level comparison. We also discuss the implications of HRF variability for fMRI studies in the spinal cord. There is a need for more dialogue within the community on the HRF confound, and we hope that our article is a catalyst in the process.

Real-time motion monitoring improves functional MRI data quality in infants	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Functional MRI; Head motion; Infant brain; Neurodevelopment; Neuroimaging	TERM-EQUIVALENT AGE; HEAD MOTION; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; ANESTHESIA; CHALLENGES; ARTIFACT; SEDATION	Imaging the infant brain with MRI has improved our understanding of early neurodevelopment. However, head motion during MRI acquisition is detrimental to both functional and structural MRI scan quality. Though infants are typically scanned while asleep, they commonly exhibit motion during scanning causing data loss. Our group has shown that providing MRI technicians with real-time motion estimates via Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) software helps obtain high-quality, low motion fMRI data. By estimating head motion in real time and displaying motion metrics to the MR technician during an fMRI scan, FIRMM can improve scanning efficiency. Here, we compared average framewise displacement (FD), a proxy for head motion, and the amount of usable fMRI data (FD <= 0.2 mm) in infants scanned with (n = 407) and without FIRMM (n = 295). Using a mixed-effects model, we found that the addition of FIRMM to current state-of-the-art infant scanning protocols significantly increased the amount of usable fMRI data acquired per infant, demonstrating its value for research and clinical infant neuroimaging.

Eigenvector centrality measure of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offer region wise network representations through fMRI diagnostic maps. The article investigates the suitability of network node centrality values to discriminate ASD subject groups compared to typically developing controls following a boxplot formalism and a classification and regression tree model. Region wise differences between normal and ASD subjects primarily belong to the frontoparietal, limbic, ventral attention, default mode and visual networks. The reduced number of regions-of-interests (ROI) clearly suggests the benefit of automated supervised machine learning algorithm over the manual classification method.

Materials and methods A structure of thin pipelines passing through a gel volume was used to simulate blood vessels in human tissue. Quantitative T2*, R2* measurements were used to study the signal change of the phantom. BOLD fMRI experiments and analysis were performed to evaluate its potential use as an fMRI simulator. Results Experimental T2*, R2* measurements showed similar behavior with published references. BOLD contrast was successfully achieved with the proposed method. In addition, there were several proposed parameters, like the angle of the phantom relative to B0, which can easily adjust the signal change and the activation area. Coefficients of variation showed good reproducibility within a month period. Statistical t maps were produced with in-house software for the BOLD measurements. Discussion T2*maps and BOLD images confirm the potential use of this phantom as an fMRI simulator and also as a tool for studying sensitivity and specificity of BOLD sequences/algorithms.

Individual variations in learning success and treatment response have been observed, yet the neural substrates underlying the learning of self-regulation remain unclear. Against this background, we explored potential brain structural predictors for learning success with pooled data from three real-time fMRI data sets. Our analysis revealed that gray matter volume of the right putamen could predict neurofeedback learning success across the three data sets (n = 66 in total). Importantly, the original studies employed different neurofeedback paradigms during which different brain regions were trained pointing to a general association with learning success independent of specific aspects of the experimental design. Given the role of the putamen in associative learning this finding may reflect an important role of instrumental learning processes and brain structural variations in associated brain regions for successful acquisition of fMRI neurofeedback-guided self-regulation.

In this respect, a Social Support fMRI task, which triggers emotional changes was designed and implemented. The detection of emotional changes from fMRI signals has significant importance in understanding the underlying mechanisms of social-support. Unfortunately, acquired signals exhibit a very low signal-to-noise ratio and strong inter-subject variations, which render the detection process a very challenging task. For this purpose, a three-phase detection system is designed. First, possible emotional change intervals are classified to isolate trivial samples and further process the challenging ones. Second, a new denoising strategy is proposed to preserve the structural waveform properties of the emotional changes, while removing noise. Third, fMRI signals are synthesized using trapezoidal modeling and a novel feature set is extracted to characterize the varying social-support levels. The analysis shows that emotional changes can be detected automatically up to a requisite level. Despite the results cannot be generalized for the entire population due to its small sample size, our findings are meaningful and suggest further research with larger datasets. The introduced task may enable further research and the proposed system may be used as a tool for social neuroscience studies.

J	Olman, CA				Olman, Cheryl A.			What multiplexing means for the interpretation of functional MRI data	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; primary visual area (V1); predictive coding; feedback-FB; neural circuits	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE V1; SUPPRESSION; FMRI; FEEDBACK; CONNECTIVITY; SIGNALS; REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION	Despite technology advances that have enabled routine acquisition of functional MRI data with sub-millimeter resolution, the inferences that cognitive neuroscientists must make to link fMRI data to behavior are complicated. Thus, a single dataset subjected to different analyses can be interpreted in different ways. This article presents two optical analogies that can be useful for framing fMRI analyses in a way that allows for multiple interpretations of fMRI data to be valid simultaneously without undermining each other. The first is reflection: when an object is reflected in a mirrored surface, it appears as if the reflected object is sharing space with the mirrored object, but of course it is not. This analogy can be a good guide for interpreting the fMRI signal, since even at sub-millimeter resolutions the signal is determined by a mixture of local and long-range neural computations. The second is refraction. If we view an object through a multi-faceted prism or gemstone, our view will change-sometimes dramatically-depending on our viewing angle. In the same way, interpretation of fMRI data (inference of underlying neuronal activity) can and should be different depending on the analysis approach. Rather than representing a weakness of the methodology, or the superiority of one approach over the other (for example, simple regression analysis versus multi-voxel pattern analysis), this is an expected consequence of how information is multiplexed in the neural networks of the brain: multiple streams of information are simultaneously present in each location. The fact that any one analysis typically shows only one view of the data also puts some parentheses around fMRI practitioners' constant search for ground truth against which to compare their data. By holding our interpretations lightly and understanding that many interpretations of the data can all be true at the same time, we do a better job of preparing ourselves to appreciate, and eventually understand, the complexity of the brain and the behavior it produces.

Imaging brain function with simultaneous BOLD and viscoelasticity contrast: fMRI/fMRE	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; fMRE; Multimodal; Viscoelasticity; Stiffness; BOLD	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE ELASTOGRAPHY; MR ELASTOGRAPHY; BLOOD-FLOW; STIFFNESS; ROBUST; MODEL; FMRI	Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is emerging as a new tool for studying viscoelastic changes in the brain resulting from functional processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel time series method to generate robust functional magnetic resonance elastography (fMRE) activation maps in response to a visual task with a flashing checkerboard stimulus. Using a single-shot spin-echo (SS-SE) pulse sequence, the underlying raw images inherently contain blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast, allowing simultaneous generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps from the magnitude and functional magnetic resonance elastography (fMRE) maps from the phase. This allows an accurate comparison of the spatially localized stiffness (fMRE) and BOLD (fMRI) changes within a single scan, eliminating confounds inherent in separately acquired scans. Results indicate that tissue stiffness within the visual cortex increases 6-11% with visual stimuli, whereas the BOLD signal change was 1-2%. Furthermore, the fMRE and fMRI activation maps have strong spatial overlap within the visual cortex, providing convincing evidence that fMRE is possible in the brain. However, the fMRE temporal SNR (tSNR(fmRE)) maps are heterogeneous across the brain. Using a dictionary matching approach to characterize the time series, the viscoelastic changes are consistent with a viscoelastic response function (VRF) time constant of 12.1 s +/- 3.0 s for a first-order exponential decay, or a shape parameter of 8.1 s +/- 1.4 s for a gamma-variate.

Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is an important research topic in the field of brain medicine, which can classify rs-fMRI data to automatically diagnose brain diseases. However, the original features of the rs-fMRI data are difficult to be extracted and the high-dimensional characteristics, which make the data analysis an extremely complicated task. Those have also plagued many researchers and bring great challenges to the existing pattern classification methods. Aiming at the high dimensionality of rs-fMRI data, in this paper, we propose a feature extraction approach based on the combination of neighborhood rough set and PCA, thereby improving the accuracy of migraine identification. Firstly, Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit plus was applied for preprocessing, calculating three characteristic indices: Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and Functional Connectivity (FC. The inter-group difference analysis was performed by two-sample T test and GRF correction. Then, correlation coefficient matrix original features extraction was performed by means of automatic anatomical label template (AAL). Finally, the original features were trained by the traditional classification algorithm in machine learning. The experimental results show that the propose approach can obtain good performance in predicting migraine.

Methods The 3D REPI method expands on the recently described golden angle rotated EPI trajectory using radial batched internal navigator echoes (TURBINE) approach by exploiting the unused perpendicular direction in the EPI readout to form fast analogues of rotated stack of stars or spirals trajectories that cover all 3 dimensions of k-space. An iterative conjugate gradient algorithm with SENSE reconstruction and time-segmented non-uniform fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used for parallel imaging acceleration and to account for the effects of B-0 inhomogeneity. The golden angle rotation allowed for sliding window reconstruction schemes to be applied in brain BOLD fMRI experiments. Results Combined whole brain visual and motor fMRI experiments were successfully carried out on a clinical 3T scanner at 2 mm isotropic and 1 x 1 x 2 mm(3) resolutions using the 3D REPI design. Improved sampling characteristics and image quality were observed for twisted trajectories at the expense of prolonged readout times and off-resonance effects. The ability to correct for rigid motion correction was also demonstrated. Conclusions 3D REPI presents a flexible approach for segmented volumetric fMRI with motion correction and high in-plane spatial resolutions. Improved BOLD fMRI brain activation maps were obtained using a sliding window reconstruction.	[Rettenmeier, Christoph A.; Stenger, V.

We analyze how some complexity indicators estimated in the subareas that constitute the default mode network (DMN) might be predictors of the neuropsychological outcomes evaluating Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and cognitive performance in persons with DS. Methods: Twenty-two DS people were assessed with the Kaufman Brief Test of Intelligence (KBIT) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) tests, and fMRI signals were recorded in a resting state over a six-minute period. In addition, 22 controls, matched by age and sex, were evaluated with the same rs-fMRI procedure. Results: There was a significant difference in complexity indicators between groups: the control group showed less complexity than the DS group. Moreover, the DS group showed more variance in the complexity indicator distributions than the control group. In the DS group, significant and negative relationships were found between some of the complexity indicators in some of the DMN networks and the cognitive performance scores. Conclusions: The DS group is characterized by more complex DMN networks and exhibits an inverse relationship between complexity and cognitive performance based on the negative parameter estimates.

Specifically, a DL model of convolutional neural networks with an encoder-decoder architecture is developed to compute personalized FNs directly from fMRI data. The DL model is trained to optimize functional homogeneity of personalized FNs without utilizing any external supervision in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate that a DL model trained on fMRI scans from the Human Connectome Project can identify personalized FNs and generalizes well across four different datasets. We further demonstrate that the identified personalized FNs are informative for predicting individual differences in behavior, brain development, and schizophrenia status. Taken together, the self-supervised DL allows for rapid, generalizable computation of personalized FNs.

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examine brain correlates of cognitive function in adults with schizophrenia, showing altered implication of associative areas such as the prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex. fMRI studies also examine brain representation of cognitive function in adolescents with early onset schizophrenia and those at risk of the disorder, yet results are often inconsistent. We compile and analyze data from eligible fMRI studies using quantitative meta-analyses to reveal concordant brain activity associated with adolescent relatives of patients with schizophrenia and those with early onset schizophrenia. Results show similar functional hubs of brain activity (eg, precuneus) yet in opposite hemispheres and clusters in ventrolateral rather than dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Other areas of altered implication include the middle temporal gyrus, insula, and cerebellum. We discuss the findings in reference to the protracted maturation of the prefrontal cortex and possible effects due to the medication status of the two groups.

This study investigated potential neurocognitive changes due to ATT and its underlying neural mechanisms using pre-to-post functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Materials and methodsFifty-four healthy participants were subjected to a randomized, sham-controlled attention training and evaluated using a neurocognitive test battery that partly took place in an fMRI environment. Participants received two doses ATT or sham ATT daily for 1 week. On day eight, all subjects completed the neurocognitive test battery again. ResultsAfter the training, the ATT group showed a significant improvement in reaction times regarding attentional disengagement compared to the sham ATT group. fMRI data showed decreased levels of activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when comparing the ATT group to the sham ATT group during attentional disengagement post intervention. No ATT > sham ATT effects were found regarding selective auditory attention, working memory performance and inhibitory control. DiscussionThese findings putatively indicate that ATT facilitates faster attention allocation and increased attentional flexibility in healthy subjects. The fMRI results suggest this ATT-dependent improvement is accompanied by reduced ACC activity, indicating a more flexible attentional state.

Task fMRI paradigms may capture more behaviorally relevant information than resting-state functional connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Behavioral differences; Predictive modeling; Functional connectivity; Cognitive development; Behavioral inhibition	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MOTION ARTIFACT; BRAIN NETWORKS; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Characterizing the optimal fMRI paradigms for detecting behaviorally relevant functional connectivity (FC) pat-terns is a critical step to furthering our knowledge of the neural basis of behavior. Previous studies suggested that FC patterns derived from task fMRI paradigms, which we refer to as task-based FC, are better correlated with individual differences in behavior than resting-state FC, but the consistency and generalizability of this advan-tage across task conditions was not fully explored. Using data from resting-state fMRI and three fMRI tasks from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (R) (ABCD), we tested whether the observed improvement in behavioral prediction power of task-based FC can be attributed to changes in brain activity induced by the task design. We decomposed the task fMRI time course of each task into the task model fit (the fitted time course of the task condition regressors from the single-subject general linear model) and the task model residuals, calculated their respective FC, and compared the behavioral prediction performance of these FC estimates to resting-state FC and the original task-based FC. The FC of the task model fit was better than the FC of the task model residual and resting-state FC at predicting a measure of general cognitive ability or two measures of performance on the fMRI tasks. The superior behavioral prediction performance of the FC of the task model fit was content-specific insofar as it was only observed for fMRI tasks that probed similar cognitive constructs to the predicted behavior of interest. To our surprise, the task model parameters, the beta estimates of the task condition regressors, were equally if not more predictive of behavioral differences than all FC measures. These results showed that the ob-served improvement of behavioral prediction afforded by task-based FC was largely driven by the FC patterns associated with the task design. Together with previous studies, our findings highlighted the importance of task design in eliciting behaviorally meaningful brain activation and FC patterns.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is the primary imaging method used to investigate dopamine function in humans. Previous PET studies have shown striatal dopamine release during simple finger tapping in both the putamen and the caudate. It is likely that dopamine release in the putamen is related to motor processes while dopamine release in the caudate could signal sustained cognitive component processes of the task, but the poor temporal resolution of PET has hindered firm conclusions. In this study we simultaneously collected [11C]Raclopride PET and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data while participants performed finger tapping, with fMRI being able to isolate activations related to individual tapping events. The results revealed fMRI-PET overlap in the bilateral putamen, which is consistent with a motor component process. Selective PET responses in the caudate, ventral striatum, and right posterior putamen, were also observed but did not overlap with fMRI responses to tapping events, suggesting that these reflect non-motor component processes of finger tapping. Our findings suggest an interplay between motor and non-motor-related dopamine release during simple finger tapping and illustrate the potential of hybrid PET-fMRI in revealing distinct component processes of cognitive functions.

Pattern analysis of neuroimaging data reveals novel insights on threat learning and extinction in humans	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Article						Fear; Extinction; FMRI; Amygdala; Hippocampus; MPFC; MVPA; Univariate	FEAR MEMORY; ACQUISITION; FMRI; SIMILARITY; AMYGDALA; HIPPOCAMPUS; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; EXPERIENCE; CIRCUITS	Several decades of rodent neurobiology research have identified a network of brain regions that support Pavlovian threat conditioning and extinction, focused predominately on the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Surprisingly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown inconsistent evidence for these regions while humans undergo threat conditioning and extinction. In this review, we suggest that translational neuroimaging efforts have been hindered by reliance on traditional univariate analysis of fMRI. Whereas univariate analyses average activity across voxels in a given region, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) leverage the information present in spatial patterns of activity. MVPA therefore pro-vides a more sensitive analysis tool to translate rodent neurobiology to human neuroimaging. We review human fMRI studies using MVPA that successfully bridge rodent models of amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC function during Pavlovian learning. We also highlight clinical applications of these information-sensitive multivariate analyses. In sum, we advocate that the field should consider adopting a variety of multivariate approaches to help bridge cutting-edge research on the neuroscience of threat and anxiety.

Studying such networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) requires a data acquisition protocol that provides blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) sensitivity across the entire brain. However, when using standard single echo, echo planar imaging protocols, researchers face a tradeoff between BOLD-sensitivity in cortex and in subcortical areas. Multi echo protocols avoid this tradeoff and can be used to optimize BOLDsensitivity across the entire brain, at the cost of an increased repetition time. Here, we empirically compare the BOLD-sensitivity of a single echo protocol to a multi echo protocol. Both protocols were designed to meet the specific requirements for studying small, iron rich subcortical structures (including a relatively high spatial resolution and short echo times), while retaining coverage and BOLD-sensitivity in cortical areas. The results indicate that both sequences lead to similar BOLD-sensitivity across the brain at 7 T.

Methods This fMRI study was designed to investigate brain response to repeated odorant stimulation with positive and negative valences in 12 healthy right-handed volunteers. There was a 25-min rest interval between two fMRI runs with identical stimulation paradigms with two odors, as phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) and isovaleric acid (IVA), and the two odors were released alternately. Results There was a similar activation pattern in regions of primary and secondary olfactory cortex induced by odors of both valences, especially by negative odor. Weakened activation of the brain is responsive to repeated both pleasant and unpleasant smell. Nevertheless, the repeated unpleasant odor has a more intimate relationship with the piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Conclusion We conclude that asymmetric brain activation in response to repeated odorant stimulation depended on valences and that the unpleasant odor can evoke more negative emotion and profound memory.

Which voxels should be considered? Here we propose a method for voxel selection based on the reliability of the data. This method isolates voxels that respond consistently across imaging runs while maximizing the reliability of multi-voxel patterns across the selected voxels. We estimate that it is suitable for designs with a least 15 conditions. In two example datasets, we found that this proposed method defines a smaller set of voxels than another common method, activity-based voxel selection. Broadly, this method eliminates the need to define regions or statistical thresholds a priori and puts the focus on data reliability as the first step in analyzing fMRI data.

It was shown that fMRI activity of the brain during viewing of emotionally neutral and moderately positive images and searching for an optimal self-regulation strategy was associated with changes in activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Analysis of behavioral factors showed that strategies of searching for the optimal way of emotional self-regulation were closely related to the general style of behavior, level of uncertainty tolerance, and commitment. The integration of psycho-diagnostic and neuroimaging data allows deeper understanding of the mechanisms of emotions regulation that contributes to the optimization of protocols for the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders.

Joint learning of multiple datasets can utilize their complementary information so as to improve learning performance, but it also gives rise to the challenge for data fusion to effectively integrate brain patterns elicited by multiple fMRI data. However, most of the current data fusion methods analyze each single dataset separately and further infer the relationship among them, which fail to utilize the multidimensional structure inherent across modalities and may ignore complex but important interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel sparse tensor decomposition method to integrate multiple task-stimulus (paradigm) fMRI data. Seeing each paradigm fMRI as one modality, our proposed method considers the relationships across subjects and modalities simultaneously. In specific, a third-order tensor is first modeled by using the functional network connectivity (FNC) of subjects in multiple fMRI paradigms. A novel sparse tensor decomposition with the regularization terms is designed to factorize the tensor into a series of rank-one components, which can extract the shared components across modalities as the embedded features. The L2,1-norm regularizer (i.e., group sparsity) is enforced to select a few common features among multiple subjects. Validation of the proposed method is performed on realistic three paradigm fMRI datasets from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study, for the study of the relationship between the FNC and human cognitive abilities. Experimental results show our method outperforms several other competing methods in the prediction of individuals with different cognitive behaviors via the wide range achievement test (WRAT). Furthermore, our method discovers the FNC related to the cognitive behaviors, such as the connectivity associated with the default mode network (DMN) for three paradigms, and the connectivity between DMN and visual (VIS) domains within the emotion task.

METHODS: A total of 103 subjects with CSVD were included. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), functional connectivity (FC) and their graph properties were applied to explore the influence of WMH burden on functional brain activity. We also investigated whether there are correlations between different functional brain characteristics and cognitive assessments. Finally, we selected disease-related rs-fMRI features in combination with ensemble learning to classify CSVD patients with low WMH load and with high WMH load. RESULTS: The high WMH load group demonstrated significantly abnormal functional brain activity based on rs-MRI data, relative to the low WMH load group. ALFF and graph properties in specific brain regions were significantly correlated with patients' cognitive assessments in CSVD. Moreover, altered rs-fMRI signal can help predict the severity of WMH in CSVD patients with an overall accuracy of 92.23%. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a comprehensive analysis and evidence for a pattern of altered functional brain activity under different WMH load in CSVD based on rs-fMRI data, enabling accurately individual prediction of status of WMH.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging responses during perceptual decision-making at 3 and 7 T in human cortex, striatum, and brainstem	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						7 T fMRI; brainstem; perceptual decision-making; reward; ultra-high field; ventral tegmental area	DOPAMINE NEURONS; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; VISUAL-MOTION; FMRI; SIGNAL; AREAS; BOLD; MT; REPLICABILITY	While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field (7 T) promises a general increase in sensitivity compared to lower field strengths, the benefits may be most pronounced for specific applications. The current study aimed to evaluate the relative benefit of 7 over 3 T fMRI for the assessment of responses evoked in different brain regions by a well-controlled cognitive task. At 3 and 7 T, the same participants made challenging perceptual decisions about visual motion combined with monetary rewards for correct choices. Previous work on this task has extensively characterized the underlying cognitive computations and single-cell responses in cortical and subcortical structures. We quantified the evoked fMRI responses in extrastriate visual cortical areas, the striatum, and the brainstem during the decision interval and the post-feedback interval of the task. The dependence of response amplitudes on field strength during the decision interval differed between cortical, striatal, and brainstem regions, with a generally bigger 7 versus 3 T benefit in subcortical structures. We also found stronger responses during relatively easier than harder decisions at 7 T for dopaminergic midbrain nuclei, in line with reward expectation. Our results demonstrate the potential of 7 T fMRI for illuminating the contribution of small brainstem nuclei to the orchestration of cognitive computations in the human brain.

Although the American Academy of Neurology recommends the use of fMRI for presurgical mapping of epilepsy of verbal and nonverbal memory to predict memory outcome, there are still no specific recommendations about which tests to use. In the current study, we evaluate the potential for clinical utility of two established neuropsychological tests of memory adapted into the fMRI setting. Method: We used the Verbal Paired Associates (VPA) for assessment of verbal memory and the Object Learning and Location (OLL) task for assessment of visuospatial memory. To confirm that these tasks engage the hippocampus, we examined their neural underpinning and patterns of laterality in 20 healthy volunteers (mean age = 26.35). Results: During fMRI of the VPA task of verbal memory, we found a strong left-lateralized posterior hippocampal activation. Remembering the location of objects in the OLL task of visuospatial memory elicited right-lateralized hippocampal activation. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the utility of the VPA and OLL tests to delineate domain-specific activity and laterality and, as such, may provide supportive evidence to strengthen links between presurgical neuropsychological assessment and memory fMRI mapping for epilepsy surgery.

However, its translation into clinical use on participants with clinical depression is unclear, the effect estimates from randomized control trials and the certainty of the supporting evidence on the effect estimates are unknown. As the number of studies on neurofeedback increases every year, and better quality evidence becomes available, we evaluate the evidence of all randomized control trials available on the clinical application of rt-fMRI-nf training on participants with clinical depression. We performed electronic searches in Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, rtFIN database, Epistemonikos, trial registers, reference lists, other systematic reviews, conference abstracts, and cross-citation in Google Scholar. Reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was judged using the GRADE framework. This review complies with PRISMA guidelines and was submitted to PROSPERO registration. We found 435 results. After the selection process, we included 11 reports corresponding to four RCTs. The effect of rt-fMRI-nf on improving the severity of clinical depression scores demonstrated a tendency to favor the intervention; however, the general effect was not significant. At end of treatment, SMD (standardized mean difference): -0.32 (95% CI -0.73 to 0.10). At follow-up, SMD: -0.33 (95% CI -0.91, 1.25). All the studies showed changes in BOLD fMRI activation after training; however, only one study confirmed regulation success during a transfer run. Whole-brain analyses suggests that rt-fMRI nf may alter activity patterns in brain networks. More studies are needed to evaluate quality of life, acceptability, adverse effects, cognitive tasks, and physiology measures. We conclude that the current evidence on the effect of rt-fMRI-nf training for decision-making outcomes in patients with clinical depression is still based on low certainty of the evidence.

Although some cross-regional temporal correlation patterns (functional connectivity; FC) exhibit a high degree of stability across individuals and species, there is growing acknowledgment that measures of FC can exhibit marked changes over a range of temporal scales. Further, FC can covary with experimental task demands and ongoing neural processes linked to arousal, consciousness and perception, cognitive and affective state, and brain-body interactions. The increased recognition that such interrelated neural processes modulate FC measurements has raised both challenges and new opportunities in using FC to investigate brain function. Here, we review recent advances in the quantification of neural effects that shape fMRI FC and discuss the broad implications of these findings in the design and analysis of fMRI studies. We also discuss how a more complete understanding of the neural factors that shape FC measurements can resolve apparent inconsistencies in the literature and lead to more interpretable conclusions from fMRI studies.

Head motion represents a significant confound in fMRI connectivity analyses. One approach to limit motion has been to use shorter MRI protocols, though this reduces the reliability of results. Hence, there is a need to implement methods to achieve high-quality, low-motion data while not sacrificing data quantity. Here we show that by using a mock scan protocol prior to a scan, in conjunction with other in-scan steps (weighted blanket and incentive system), it is possible to achieve low-motion fMRI data in pediatric participants (age range: 7-17 years old) undergoing a 60 min MRI session. We also observe that motion is low during the MRI protocol in a separate replication group of participants, including some with autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, the results indicate it is possible to conduct long scan protocols in difficult-to-scan populations and still achieve high-quality data, thus potentially allowing more reliable fMRI findings.

Current motion correction approaches for fetal fMRI choose a single 3D volume from a specific acquisition timepoint with least motion artefacts as reference volume, and perform interpolation for the reconstruction of the motion corrected time series. The results can suffer, if no low-motion frame is available, and if reconstruction does not exploit any assumptions about the continuity of the fMRI signal. Here, we propose a novel framework, which estimates a high-resolution reference volume by using outlier robust motion correction, and by utilizing Huber L2 regularization for intra-stack volumetric reconstruction of the motion-corrected fetal brain fMRI. We performed an extensive parameter study to investigate the effectiveness of motion estimation and present in this work benchmark metrics to quantify the effect of motion correction and regularised volumetric reconstruction approaches on functional connectivity computations. We demonstrate the proposed framework's ability to improve functional connectivity estimates, reproducibility and signal interpretability, which is clinically highly desirable for the establishment of prognostic noninvasive imaging biomarkers. The motion correction and volumetric reconstruction framework is made available as an open-source package of NiftyMIC.

Studies examining the relationship between electromagnetic and hemodynamic measures have revealed correlated patterns across brain regions but the role of the applied stimulation or experimental tasks in these correlation patterns is still poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the across-tasks variability of MEG-fMRI relationship using data recorded during three distinct naming tasks (naming objects and actions from action images, and objects from object images), from the same set of participants. Our results demonstrate that the MEG-fMRI correlation pattern varies according to the performed task, and that this variability shows distinct spectral profiles across brain regions. Notably, analysis of the MEG data alone did not reveal modulations across the examined tasks in the time-frequency windows emerging from the MEG-fMRI correlation analysis. Our results suggest that the electromagnetic-hemodynamic correlation could serve as a more sensitive proxy for task-dependent neural engagement in cognitive tasks than isolated within-modality measures.

Seventeen children with ADHD were selected for 8 weeks of rope skipping aerobic training, and fMRI findings and executive function were examined before and after training. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC) indexes were used in fMRI analysis, whereas the flanker task was used to test executive function. A paired t test was used to compare the fMRI indexes and response time of executive function before and after training. After aerobic exercise, the brain regions in which the ReHo value of ADHD children significantly increased included the left middle frontal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus; the brain region in which the DC value increased was the right posterior cingulate cortex. The flanker task response time decreased significantly (P < 0.05, after correction) after aerobic exercise. The study findings support the hypothesis that aerobic exercise can improve the executive function of ADHD children, and the brain mechanism involved is mainly related to the enhancement of spontaneous prefrontal lobe activity.

Studies demonstrate effects in various subdivisions of the lateral occipital complex (LOC), including retinotopically tuned areas LO-1 and LO-2, and dorsal stream areas in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Therefore, we aimed to examine fMRI adaptation in four subdivisions of the LOC (LO-proper, posterior fusiform sulcus, LO-1, and LO-2) and three discrete regions in the IPS (caudal IPS, IPSproper, and anterior IPS) to clarify the role that these structures play in form, orientation, and size processing. Participants performed three tasks which involved judging whether two serially presented novel objects shared the same form, orientation, or size. On each version of the task, one feature varied from trial-to-trial (e.g., form) while the other two features (e.g., orientation and size) were held constant. In this way, we were able to examine the unique fMRI signal changes in response to changes in form, orientation, and size in isolation. Form adaptation - a decrease in fMRI signal following repeated presentation of the same stimulus - was present in LO-proper and pFS, highlighting the role of LOC in form processing. Size repetition enhancement - an increase in fMRI signal following repeated presentations of the same stimulus - was observed in pFs. We propose that the latter result demonstrates the effects that top-down factors can have on visual areas, specifically when there is stimulus uncertainty. There was no evidence of orientation processing in any of the regions examined. Neither form adaptation nor size repetition enhancement was present in the three IPS regions-of-interest. Last, retinotopically defined LO1 and LO2 could not be reliably identified in participants and therefore we were unable to examine adaptation in these areas as we originally intended to do.

Forging a path to mesoscopic imaging success with ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						ultra-high field; fMRI; layer dependent; cortical columns; spatial specificity	OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SPIN-ECHO FMRI; HUMAN BRAIN; GRADIENT-ECHO; 7 T; GEOMETRIC DISTORTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with ultra-high field (UHF, 7+ Tesla) technology enable the acquisition of high-resolution images. In this work, we discuss recent achievements in UHF fMRI at the mesoscopic scale, on the order of cortical columns and layers, and examine approaches to addressing common challenges. As researchers push to smaller and smaller voxel sizes, acquisition and analysis decisions have greater potential to degrade spatial accuracy, and UHF fMRI data must be carefully interpreted. We consider the impact of acquisition decisions on the spatial specificity of the MR signal with a representative dataset with 0.8 mm isotropic resolution. We illustrate the trade-offs in contrast with noise ratio and spatial specificity of different acquisition techniques and show that acquisition blurring can increase the effective voxel size by as much as 50% in some dimensions. We further describe how different sources of degradations to spatial resolution in functional data may be characterized. Finally, we emphasize that progress in UHF fMRI depends not only on scientific discovery and technical advancement, but also on informal discussions and documentation of challenges researchers face and overcome in pursuit of their goals. This article is part of the theme issue 'Key relationships between non-invasive functional neuroimaging and the underlying neuronal activity'.

Such approaches may fail to capture the nonlinear structure of brain networks and neglect the complementary information contained in FC networks (FCNs) from multiple datasets. To address this challenging issue, we use multiview dimensionality reduction to extract a coherent low-dimensional representation of the FCNs from resting-state and emotion identification task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Methods: We propose a scheme based on multiview diffusion map to extract intrinsic features while preserving the underlying geometric structure of high dimensional datasets. This method is robust to noise and small variations in the data. Results: After validation on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort data, the predictive model built from both resting-state and emotion identification task-based fMRI datasets outperforms the one using each individual fMRI dataset. In addition, the proposed model achieves better prediction performance than principal component analysis (PCA) and three other competing data fusion methods. Conclusion: Our framework for combing multiple FCNs in one predictive model exhibits improved prediction performance. Significance: To our knowledge, we demonstrate a first application of multiview diffusion map to successfully fuse different types of fMRI data for predicting fluid intelligence (gF).

Computational models were constructed based on diffusion-weighted MRI scans and fit to the experimental rs-fMRI data.Results We found decreased large-scale functional connectivity across sensory and association areas and for all functional subnetworks for the ScZ group. Additionally global synchrony was reduced in patients while metastability was unaltered. Perturbations of the computational model revealed that decreased global coupling and increased background noise levels both explained the experimentally found deficits better than local changes to the GABAergic or glutamatergic system.Discussion The current study suggests that large-scale alterations in ScZ are more likely the result of global rather than local network changes.

However, the inconsistent distribution and representation between fMRI signals and visual images cause great 'domain gap'. Moreover, the limited fMRI data instances generally suffer from the issues of low signal noise ratio (SNR), extremely high dimensionality, and limited spatial resolution. Existing methods are often affected by these issues so that a satisfactory reconstruction is still an open problem. In this paper, we show that it is possible to obtain a promising solution by learning visually-guided latent cognitive representations from the fMRI signals, and inversely decoding them to the image stimuli. The resulting framework is called Dual-Variational Autoencoder/ Generative Adversarial Network (DVAE/GAN), which combines the advantages of adversarial representation learning with knowledge distillation. In addition, we introduce a novel three-stage learning strategy which enables the (cognitive) encoder to gradually distill useful knowledge from the paired (visual) encoder during the learning process. Extensive experimental results on both artificial and natural images have demonstrated that our method could achieve surprisingly good results and outperform the available alternatives.

Here, we applied simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and calcium recording with optogenetic activation of the corpus callosum (CC) connecting barrel cortices (BC). Robust positive BOLD was detected in the ipsilateral BC due to antidromic activity, spreading to the ipsilateral motor cortex (MC), and posterior thalamus (PO). In the orthodromic target, positive BOLD was reliably evoked by 2 Hz light pulses, whereas 40 Hz light pulses led to reduced calcium, indicative of CC-mediated inhibition. This presumed optogenetic CC-mediated inhibition was further elucidated by pairing light pulses with whisker stimulation at varied interstimulus intervals. Whisker-induced positive BOLD and calcium signals were reduced at intervals of 50/100 ms. The calcium-amplitude-modulation-based correlation with whole-brain fMRI signal revealed that the inhibitory effects spread to contralateral BC, ipsilateral MC, and PO. This work raises the need for fMRI to elucidate the brain-wide network activation in response to optogenetic stimulation.

We want to comment that this reproductivity issue is associated with the hypothesis testing paradigm, which can be potentially mitigated by a machine learning based predictive modeling approach. Furthermore, such an approach also opens new possibilities in detecting subtle spatial patterns across the brain and in estimating more useful individual effects in neurology and psychiatry.

Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality - such as whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function - such as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks - including visual stimuli, decision making, flavor, and working memory - confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.

According to prior studies, the neurodegenerative process in idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) interacts significantly with neuromuscular abnormalities. Although these underlying neuromuscular changes might influence the temporal characteristics of HRF and fMRI signals, relatively few studies have explored this possibility. We hypothesized that such alterations would engender changes in estimated functional connectivity (FC) in fMRI space compared to latent neural space. To test these theories, we calculated voxel-level HRFs by deconvolving resting-state fMRI data from PD patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 47). Significant group differences in HRF (P < 0.05, Gaussian random field-corrected) were observed in several regions previously associated with PD. Subsequently, we focused on putamen-seed-based FC differences between the PD and HC groups using fMRI and latent neural signals. The results suggested that neglecting HRF variability may cultivate false-positive and false-negative FC group differences. Furthermore, HRF was related to dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2) gene expression (P < 0.001, t = -7.06, false discover ratecorrected). Taken together, these findings reveal HRF variation and its possible underlying molecular mechanism in PD, and suggest that deconvolution could reduce the impact of HRF variation on FC group differences.

Until recently, there has been little information about EEG data quality and safety when used with newer multi-band (MB) fMRI sequences. Here, we measure the relative heating of a MB protocol compared with a standard single-band (SB) protocol considered to be safe. We also evaluated EEG quality recorded concurrently with the MB protocol on humans. Materials and methods We compared radiofrequency (RF)-related heating at multiple electrodes and magnetic field magnitude, B1+RMS, of a MB fMRI sequence with whole-brain coverage (TR = 440 ms, MB factor = 4) against a previously recommended, safe SB sequence using a phantom outfitted with a 64-channel EEG cap. Next, 9 human subjects underwent eyes-closed resting state EEG-fMRI using the MB sequence. Additionally, in three of the subjects resting state EEG was recorded also during the SB sequence and in an fMRI-free condition to directly compare EEG data quality across scanning conditions. EEG data quality was assessed by the ability to remove gradient and cardioballistic artifacts along with a clean spectrogram. Results The heating induced by the MB sequence was lower than that of the SB sequence by a factor of 0.73 +/- 0.38. This is consistent with an expected heating ratio of 0.64, calculated from the square of the ratio of B1+RMS values of the sequences. In the resting state EEG data, gradient and cardioballistic artifacts were successfully removed using traditional template subtraction. All subjects showed an individual alpha peak in the spectrogram with a posterior topography characteristic of eyes-closed EEG. The success of artifact rejection for the MB sequence was comparable to that in traditional SB sequences. Conclusions Our study shows that B1+RMS is a useful indication of the relative heating of fMRI protocols. This observation indicates that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings using this MB sequence can be safe in terms of RF-related heating, and that EEG data recorded using this sequence is of acceptable quality after traditional artifact removal techniques.

J	Shi, JH; Liu, BL				Shi, Jiahao; Liu, Baolin			Stage detection of mild cognitive impairment via fMRI using Hilbert Huang transform based classification framework	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment; Hilbert-Huang transform; rs-fMRI signal	RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY; MCI; AMPLITUDE; SPECTRUM; FLUCTUATIONS; MATTER	Purpose This work aims to establish a classification framework for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at different stages (early MCI and late MCI) through direct analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals and using the accuracy (total correct rate), specificity (correct rate of late MCI) and sensitivity (correct rate of early MCI) to validate its classification performance. Methods All fMR images of subjects were parcellated into 116 regions of interest (ROIs) by applying the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) template, and the average rs-fMRI signals of each ROI were extracted. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was introduced into the framework to decompose each rs-fMRI signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and to analyze these nonstationary and nonlinear time-series from the perspective of multiresolution. After obtaining the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of all IMFs of a signal, the Hilbert weighted frequencies (HWFs) were calculated and combined into a vector as the feature of the corresponding ROI. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was implemented to classify MCI at different stages. We used the independent two-sample t-test as the feature selection method and measured the classification performance through the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. Results Results on 77 early MCI (eMCI) and 64 late MCI (lMCI) with baseline rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) yielded 87.94% classification accuracy. Some of the brain regions with significant differences found by previous studies have been confirmed in this work. We found that HWF characteristics exhibited a significant downward trend in all cerebellar regions. The rs-fMRI signals in differential brain regions have not changed completely, but only altered in some narrow frequency bands. The analysis results showed that during the progress of MCI, the main changes of rs-fMRI were concentrated in IMF3, while IMFs with other indexes also contained HWF features with high SVM weights, such as Orbitofrontal superior frontal gyrus in IMF2, Insula in IMF4, and Lobule III of vermis in IMF5, indicating that other IMFs provide important information for the diagnosis of MCI as well. Conclusions This work confirmed the classification ability of HHT-based classification framework in classification of at different stages of MCI. Through the analysis, we found that during the progress of MCI the main changes of rs-fMRI were concentrated in IMF3, and HWF characteristics showed a significant downward trend in all cerebellar regions.

Brain activity in well-controlled perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-infected young adults: a functional magnetic resonance imaging pilot study	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			English	Article						Adolescents; cART; Fluency; fMRI; Neuroimaging; Perinatal HIV	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; VERBAL FLUENCY; NEUROCOGNITIVE OUTCOMES; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; HIV; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; EVENTS	Introduction and aim. Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (PHIV) is considered a chronic disease that has highlighted several cognitive deficits. From birth to early adulthood, cognition is known to play a fundamental role. However, although neurocognitive processes associated with PHIV have been extensively described by psychometric testing, data is scarce on neural activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which provides in vivo physiological information. Subjects and methods. We studied described impaired cognitive processes using fMRI on a group of PHIV adolescents with good immunovirological indications and healthy matched controls. Psychological status and neurocognitive functions were also assessed. Results. There were no significant differences between HIV+ and HIV- groups, either on neurocognitive testing nor in fMRI activity for phonological fluency tasks. Prolonged duration of cART was positively associated with greater brain activity in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) which could indicate functional compensation. Conclusions. These results suggest that neural activity through fMRI in PHIV adolescents with good daily functioning and good immunovirological control may be similar to theirpeers.

How to Interpret Resting-State fMRI: Ask Your Participants	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; resting-state; introspection; coactivation patterns; ongoing experience; consciousness	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; BOLD SIGNALS; FLUCTUATIONS; MIND; NETWORK; ACTIVATION; EXPERIENCE	Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) reveals brain dynamics in a task-unconstrained environment as subjects let their minds wander freely. Consequently, resting subjects navigate a rich space of cognitive and perceptual states (i.e., ongoing experience). How this ongoing experience shapes rsfMRI summary metrics (e.g., functional connectivity) is unknown, yet likely to contribute uniquely to within-and between-subject differences. Here we argue that understanding the role of ongoing experience in rsfMRI requires access to standardized, temporally resolved, scientifically validated first-person descriptions of those experiences. We suggest best practices for obtaining those descriptions via introspective methods appropriately adapted for use in fMRI research. We conclude with a set of guidelines for fusing these two data types to answer pressing questions about the etiology of rsfMRI.

Previous resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies have demonstrated suppressed functional connectivity (FC) of the entire brain networks, especially the default mode networks, transitioning from the awake to GA condition. However, accuracy and reliability were limited by previous administration methods (e.g. face mask) and short rs-fMRI scans. Therefore, in this study, a clinical scenario of epilepsy patients undergoing laser interstitial thermal therapy was leveraged to acquire 15 min of rs-fMRI while under general endotracheal anesthesia to maximize the accuracy of sevoflurane level. Nine recruited patients had fMRI acquired during awake and under GA, of which seven were included in both static and dynamic FC analyses. Group independent component analysis and a sliding-window method followed by k-means clustering were applied to identify four dynamic brain states, which characterized subtypes of FC patterns. Our results showed that a low-FC brain state was characteristic of the GA condition as a single featuring state during the entire rs-fMRI session; In contrast, the awake condition exhibited frequent fluctuations between three distinct brain states, one of which was a highly synchronized brain state not seen in GA. In conclusion, our study revealed remarkable dynamic connectivity changes from awake to GA condition and demonstrated the advantages of dynamic FC analysis for future studies in the assessments of the effects of GA on brain functional activities.

Towards assessing subcortical "deep brain" biomarkers of PTSD with functional near-infrared spectroscopy	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						PTSD; fMRI; fNIRS; machine learning	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; DISSOCIATIVE RESPONSES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; AMYGDALA; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; FMRI; TRAUMA; CORTEX; YOUTH	Assessment of brain function with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is limited to the outer regions of the cortex. Previously, we demonstrated the feasibility of inferring activity in subcortical "deep brain" regions using cortical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and fNIRS activity in healthy adults. Access to subcortical regions subserving emotion and arousal using affordable and portable fNIRS is likely to be transformative for clinical diagnostic and treatment planning. Here, we validate the feasibility of inferring activity in subcortical regions that are central to the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; i.e. amygdala and hippocampus) using cortical fMRI and simulated fNIRS activity in a sample of adolescents diagnosed with PTSD (N = 20, mean age = 15.3 +/- 1.9 years) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 20, mean age = 14.5 +/- 2.0 years) as they performed a facial expression task. We tested different prediction models, including linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, and a k-nearest neighbors model. Inference of subcortical fMRI activity with cortical fMRI showed high prediction performance for the amygdala (r > 0.91) and hippocampus (r > 0.95) in both groups. Using fNIRS simulated data, relatively high prediction performance for deep brain regions was maintained in healthy controls (r > 0.79), as well as in youths with PTSD (r > 0.75). The linear regression and neural network models provided the best predictions.

The art and science of using quality control to understand and improve fMRI data	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; quality control; neuroimaging; reproducibility; resting state; GLM; noise removal	MULTICENTER FMRI; SIGNAL; ASSURANCE; MOTION	Designing and executing a good quality control (QC) process is vital to robust and reproducible science and is often taught through hands on training. As FMRI research trends toward studies with larger sample sizes and highly automated processing pipelines, the people who analyze data are often distinct from those who collect and preprocess the data. While there are good reasons for this trend, it also means that important information about how data were acquired, and their quality, may be missed by those working at later stages of these workflows. Similarly, an abundance of publicly available datasets, where people (not always correctly) assume others already validated data quality, makes it easier for trainees to advance in the field without learning how to identify problematic data. This manuscript is designed as an introduction for researchers who are already familiar with fMRI, but who did not get hands on QC training or who want to think more deeply about QC. This could be someone who has analyzed fMRI data but is planning to personally acquire data for the first time, or someone who regularly uses openly shared data and wants to learn how to better assess data quality. We describe why good QC processes are important, explain key priorities and steps for fMRI QC, and as part of the FMRI Open QC Project, we demonstrate some of these steps by using AFNI software and AFNI's QC reports on an openly shared dataset. A good QC process is context dependent and should address whether data have the potential to answer a scientific question, whether any variation in the data has the potential to skew or hide key results, and whether any problems can potentially be addressed through changes in acquisition or data processing. Automated metrics are essential and can often highlight a possible problem, but human interpretation at every stage of a study is vital for understanding causes and potential solutions.

Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric illness which needs early and accurate diagnosis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with appropriate spatial resolution is a powerful technique for visualizing human brain activity. One of the major challenges in classifying these images is the high-dimensional fMRI images along with the poor quality of these data. In this study, a general framework for classifying images into two groups of healthy and schizophrenic patients is presented. In this method, after preprocessing fMRI images, functional connectivity analysis is used to extract the features. After extracting functional mappings, we use three-dimensional convolutional neural network and long short-term memory recurrent network to extract spatial and temporal information to classify activity maps. Our results show that the use of these features can lead to a strong classification on the COBRE dataset with an accuracy of 92.32%, which is very promising.

Over the last 2 decades, we have seen dramatic improvements in the way we can image the human brain and noninvasively estimate the location of critical functional networks. In certain patients with brain tumors and epilepsy, intraoperative electrical stimulation has revealed direct links between these networks and their function. The focus of these techniques has rightfully been identification and preservation of so-called "eloquent" brain functions (i.e., motor and language), but there is building momentum for more extensive mapping of cognitive and emotional networks. In addition, there is growing interest in mapping these functions in patients with a broad range of neurosurgical diseases. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a noninvasive imaging modality that is able to measure spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuations at rest to infer neuronal activity. Rs-fMRI may be able to map cognitive and emotional networks for individual patients. In this review, the authors give an overview of the rs-fMRI technique and associated cognitive and emotional resting-state networks, discuss the potential applications of rs-fMRI, and propose future directions for the mapping of cognition and emotion in neurosurgical patients.

J	Zhang, RY; Wei, XX; Kay, K				Zhang, Ru-Yuan; Wei, Xue-Xin; Kay, Kendrick			Understanding multivariate brain activity: Evaluating the effect of voxelwise noise correlations on population codes in functional magnetic resonance imaging	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FISHER INFORMATION; FMRI ACTIVITY; AREA MT; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; DISCHARGE; ACCURACY; PATTERNS; NEURONS; SCALES	Author summary Noise correlation (NC) is the key component of multivariate response distributions and thus characterizing its effects on population codes is the cornerstone for understanding probabilistic computation in the brain. Despite extensive studies of NCs in neurophysiology, little is known with respect to their role in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We characterize the effect of voxelwise NC by building voxel-encoding models and directly quantifying the amount of information in simulated multivariate fMRI data. In contrast to the detrimental effects of NC implied in neurophysiological studies, we find that voxelwise NCs can enhance information codes if NC is sufficiently strong. Our work highlights the important role of noise correlations in decipher population codes using fMRI. Previous studies in neurophysiology have shown that neurons exhibit trial-by-trial correlated activity and that such noise correlations (NCs) greatly impact the accuracy of population codes. Meanwhile, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a mainstream approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it remains unclear how NCs between voxels influence MVPA performance. Here, we tackle this issue by combining voxel-encoding modeling and MVPA. We focus on a well-established form of NC, tuning-compatible noise correlation (TCNC), whose sign and magnitude are systematically related to the tuning similarity between two units. We show that this form of voxelwise NCs can improve MVPA performance if NCs are sufficiently strong. We also confirm these results using standard information-theoretic analyses in computational neuroscience. In the same theoretical framework, we further demonstrate that the effects of noise correlations at both the neuronal level and the voxel level may manifest differently in typical fMRI data, and their effects are modulated by tuning heterogeneity. Our results provide a theoretical foundation to understand the effect of correlated activity on population codes in macroscopic fMRI data. Our results also suggest that future fMRI research could benefit from a closer examination of the correlational structure of multivariate responses, which is not directly revealed by conventional MVPA approaches.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can mitigate the adverse psychosocial outcomes of SUDs, but the underlying neurobiology is unclear. Emerging findings were systematically synthesised from fMRI studies about MBI-associated changes in brain function in SUDs and their associations with mindfulness, drug quantity, and craving. Methods PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Results Group by time effects indicated that MBIs in SUDs (6 tobacco and 1 opioid) were associated with changes in the function of brain pathways implicated in mindfulness and addiction (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex and striatum), which correlated with greater mindfulness, lower craving and drug quantity. Conclusions The evidence for fMRI-related changes with MBI in SUD is currently limited. More fMRI studies are required to identify how MBIs mitigate and facilitate recovery from aberrant brain functioning in SUDs.

We argue that resting state studies hold the paired promises of discovering novel functional brain networks, and of avoiding some of the limitations of task-based fMRI. However, we argue that the very features of experimental design that enable resting state fMRI to support exploratory science also generate a novel confound. We argue that seemingly key features of resting state functional connectivity networks may be artefacts resulting from sampling a 'mixture distribution' of diverse brain networks active at different times during the scan. We explore the consequences of this 'mixture view' for attempts to theorize about the cognitive or psychological functions of resting state networks, as well as the value of exploratory experiments.

We report an fMRI study of language comprehension processes in these "zero pronoun" cases. The fMRI data come from Chinese speakers who listened to an audiobook. We conducted both univariate GLM and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on these data. We found increased left Temporal Lobe activity for zero pronouns compared to overt subjects, suggesting additional effort searching for an antecedent during zero pronoun resolution. MVPA further revealed that the intended referent of a zero pronoun can be decoded in the Parahippocampal Gyrus and the Precuneus shortly after its presentation. This highlights the role of memory and discourse-level processing in resolving referential expressions, including unspoken ones, in naturalistic language comprehension.

This approach is confounded, however, by the fact that physical restraint and loud unpredictable acoustic noise must inevitably accompany fMRI recordings. These factors induce marked stress in rodents, and stress-related elevations of corticosterone levels are known to alter information processing and cognition in the rodent. Here, we propose a habituation strategy that spans specific stages of adaptation to restraint, MRI noise, and confinement stress in awake rats and circumvents the need for surgical head restraint. This habituation protocol results in stress levels during awake fMRI that do not differ from pre-handling levels and enables stable image acquisition with very low motion artifacts. For this, rats were gradually trained over a period of three weeks and eighteen training sessions. Stress levels were assessed by analysis of fecal corticosterone metabolite levels and breathing rates. We observed significant drops in stress levels to below pre-handling levels at the end of the habituation procedure. During fMRI in awake rats, after the conclusion of habituation and using a non-invasive head-fixation device, breathing was stable and head motion artifacts were minimal. A task-based fMRI experiment, using acoustic stimulation, conducted 2 days after the end of habituation, resulted in precise whole brain mapping of BOLD signals in the brain, with clear delineation of the expected auditory-related structures. The active discrimination by the animals of the acoustic stimuli from the backdrop of scanner noise was corroborated by significant increases in BOLD signals in the thalamus and reticular formation. Taken together, these data show that effective habituation to awake fMRI can be achieved by gradual and incremental acclimatization to the experimental conditions. Subsequent BOLD recordings, even during superimposed acoustic stimulation, reflect low stress-levels, low motion and a corresponding high-quality image acquisition. Furthermore, BOLD signals obtained during fMRI indicate that effective habituation facilitates selective attention to sensory stimuli that can in turn support the discrimination of cognitive processes in the absence of stress confounds.

However, acute DoC is rarely investigated, although identifying residual consciousness is key to clinical decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, the objective of the prospective, observational, tertiary centre cohort, diagnostic phase IIb study 'Consciousness in neurocritical care cohort study using EEG and fMRI' (CONNECT-ME, NCT02644265) was to assess the accuracy of fMRI and EEG to identify residual consciousness in acute DoC in the ICU. Between April 2016 and November 2020, 87 acute DoC patients with traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury were examined with repeated clinical assessments, fMRI and EEG. Resting-state EEG and EEG with external stimulations were evaluated by visual analysis, spectral band analysis and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) consciousness classifier. In addition, within- and between-network resting-state connectivity for canonical resting-state fMRI networks was assessed. Next, we used EEG and fMRI data at study enrolment in two different machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest and SVM with a linear kernel) to distinguish patients in a minimally conscious state or better (>= MCS) from those in coma or unresponsive wakefulness state (<= UWS) at time of study enrolment and at ICU discharge (or before death). Prediction performances were assessed with area under the curve (AUC). Of 87 DoC patients (mean age, 50.0 +/- 18 years, 43% female), 51 (59%) were <= UWS and 36 (41%) were >= MCS at study enrolment. Thirty-one (36%) patients died in the ICU, including 28 who had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. EEG and fMRI predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge, with maximum AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.80) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.77-0.80), respectively. Models based on combined EEG and fMRI features predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge with maximum AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.86) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), respectively, with improved positive predictive value and sensitivity. Overall, both machine-learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) performed equally well. In conclusion, we suggest that acute DoC prediction models in the ICU be based on a combination of fMRI and EEG features, regardless of the machine-learning algorithm used.

J	Beyer, E; Poudel, G; Antonopoulos, S; Thomson, H; Lorenzetti, V				Beyer, Emillie; Poudel, Govinda; Antonopoulos, Stephanie; Thomson, Hannah; Lorenzetti, Valentina			Brain reward function in people who use cannabis: a systematic review	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						cannabis; monetary incentive delay task (MIDT); reward processing; fMRI; neuroimaging; systematic review; functional neuroimaging		Rationale Cannabis is one of the most widely used psychoactive substances globally. Cannabis use can be associated with alterations of reward processing, including affective flattening, apathy, anhedonia, and lower sensitivity to natural rewards in conjunction with higher sensitivity to cannabis-related rewards. Such alterations have been posited to be driven by changes in underlying brain reward pathways, as per prominent neuroscientific theories of addiction. Functional neuroimaging (fMRI) studies have examined brain reward function in cannabis users via the monetary incentive delay (MID) fMRI task; however, this evidence is yet to be systematically synthesised.Objectives We aimed to systematically integrate the evidence on brain reward function in cannabis users examined by the MID fMRI task; and in relation to metrics of cannabis exposure (e.g., dosage, frequency) and other behavioural variables.Method We pre-registered the review in PROSPERO and reported it using PRISMA guidelines. Literature searches were conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and Scopus.Results Nine studies were included, comprising 534 people with mean ages 16-to-28 years, of which 255 were people who use cannabis daily or almost daily, and 279 were controls. The fMRI literature to date led to largely non-significant group differences. A few studies reported group differences in the ventral striatum while participants anticipated rewards and losses; and in the caudate while participants received neutral outcomes. A few studies examined correlations between brain function and withdrawal, dosage, and age of onset; and reported inconsistent findings.Conclusions There is emerging but inconsistent evidence of altered brain reward function in cannabis users examined with the MID fMRI task. Future fMRI studies are required to confirm if the brain reward system is altered in vulnerable cannabis users who experience a Cannabis Use Disorder, as postulated by prominent neuroscientific theories of addiction.

Resting-state fMRI in depressive and (hypo)manic mood states in bipolar disorders: A systematic review	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Resting-state fMRI; Bipolar depression; (hypo)mania; Systematic review; Brain networks; Functional connectivity	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BASE-LINE; METAANALYSIS; ABNORMALITIES; CORTEX; ARCHITECTURE	Objective: Abnormalities in spontaneous brain activity, measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), may be key biomarkers for bipolar disorders. This systematic review compares rs-fMRI findings in people experiencing a bipolar depressive or (hypo)manic episode to bipolar euthymia and/or healthy participants. Methods: Medline, Web of Science and Embase were searched up until April 2021. Studies without control group, or including minors, neurological co-morbidities or mixed episodes, were excluded. Qualitative synthesis was used to report results and risk of bias was assessed using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute tool for case-control studies. Results: Seventy-one studies were included (3167 bipolar depressed/706 (hypo)manic). In bipolar depression, studies demonstrated default-mode (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) dysfunction, altered baseline activity in the precuneus, insula, striatum, cingulate, frontal and temporal cortex, and disturbed regional homogeneity in parietal, temporal and pericentral areas. Functional connectivity was altered in thalamocortical circuits and between the cingulate cortex and precuneus. In (hypo)mania, studies reported altered functional connectivity in the amygdala, frontal and cingulate cortex. Finally, rs-fMRI disturbances in the insula and putamen correlate with depressive symptoms, cerebellar resting-state alterations could evolve with disease progression and altered amygdala connectivity might mediate lithium effects. Conclusions: Our results suggest DMN and FPN dysfunction in bipolar depression, whereas local rs-fMRI alterations might differentiate mood states. Future studies should consider controlling rs-fMRI findings for potential clinical confounding factors such as medication. Considerable heterogeneity of methodology between studies limits conclusions. Standardised clinical reporting and consistent analysis approaches would increase coherence in this promising field.

This study aimed to investigate the placebo modulation of brain activity associated with orthodontic pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods This longitudinal fMRI experiment recruited 23 volunteers and a self-contrast method was used. At first time, the participants were scanned without placebo (first period), followed by a 30-day washout, the participants were scanned again with placebo administration (second period). Orthodontic pain was caused by orthodontic separators placement between the lower right molars for both two periods. 24 h after placement, the MRI scans were taken, including a bite/non-bite task fMRI and a resting-state fMRI. A generalized linear model was used to identify pain-regulating network from task fMRI. Functional connectivity analysis of pain-related brain regions was performed to study the placebo effect on connectivity of pain-regulating networks using resting-state fMRI. Results The results of brain activation patterns were largely similar under placebo and non-placebo conditions. Under the non-placebo condition, the activities in multiple brain regions, including the pre-central gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and supramarginal gyrus, were significantly higher than that of the placebo condition. However, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was activated under the non-placebo condition but not in the placebo one. The functional connectivities between ACC and orbitofrontal cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex were reduced under placebo condition. Conclusion Participants demonstrated similar brain activation patterns for orthodontic pain with or without placebos. With placebo, reduced activation in primary sensory cortex and decreased activation in ACC indicated that ACC could be fundamental in analgesia.

J	Abreu, R; Duarte, JV				Abreu, Rodolfo; Duarte, Joao Valente			Quantitative Assessment of the Impact of Geometric Distortions and Their Correction on fMRI Data Analyses	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; susceptibility artifact; geometric distortions and correction; B-0 field mapping; neuroimaging	POINT-SPREAD FUNCTION; ECHO-PLANAR IMAGES; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE CORRECTION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY ARTIFACTS; BRAIN; ROBUST; EPI; REGISTRATION; DIFFUSION	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is typically collected with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequences, which are particularly prone to the susceptibility artifact as a result of B-0 field inhomogeneity. The component derived from in-plane spin dephasing induces pixel intensity variations and, more critically, geometric distortions. Despite the physical mechanisms underlying the susceptibility artifact being well established, a systematic investigation on the impact of the associated geometric distortions, and the direct comparison of different approaches to tackle them, on fMRI data analyses is missing. Here, we compared two different distortion correction approaches, by acquiring additional: (1) EPI data with reversed phase encoding direction (TOPUP), and (2) standard (and undistorted) GE data at two different echo times (GRE). We first characterized the geometric distortions and the correction approaches based on the estimated Delta B-0 field offset and voxel shift maps, and then conducted three types of analyses on the distorted and corrected fMRI data: (1) registration into structural data, (2) identification of resting-state networks (RSNs), and (3) mapping of task-related brain regions of interest. GRE estimated the largest voxel shifts and more positively impacted the quality of the analyses, in terms of the (significantly lower) cost function of the registration, the (higher) spatial overlap between the RSNs and appropriate templates, and the (significantly higher) sensitivity of the task-related mapping based on the Z-score values of the associated activation maps, although also evident when considering TOPUP. fMRI data should thus be corrected for geometric distortions, with the choice of the approach having a modest, albeit positive, impact on the fMRI analyses.

J	Golestani, AM; Chen, JJ				Golestani, Ali M.; Chen, J. Jean			Comparing data-driven physiological denoising approaches for resting-state fMRI: implications for the study of aging	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; resting-state; physiological noise; data-driven; brain connectivity	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; MOTION-RELATED ARTIFACTS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; GLOBAL SIGNAL; CONFOUND REGRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HEART-RATE; ICA-AROMA; NOISE; NETWORK	Introduction Physiological nuisance contributions by cardiac and respiratory signals have a significant impact on resting-state fMRI data quality. As these physiological signals are often not recorded, data-driven denoising methods are commonly used to estimate and remove physiological noise from fMRI data. To investigate the efficacy of these denoising methods, one of the first steps is to accurately capture the cardiac and respiratory signals, which requires acquiring fMRI data with high temporal resolution.Methods In this study, we used such high-temporal resolution fMRI data to evaluate the effectiveness of several data-driven denoising methods, including global-signal regression (GSR), white matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression (WM-CSF), anatomical (aCompCor) and temporal CompCor (tCompCor), ICA-AROMA. Our analysis focused on the consequence of changes in low-frequency, cardiac and respiratory signal power, as well as age-related differences in terms of functional connectivity (fcMRI).Results Our results confirm that the ICA-AROMA and GSR removed the most physiological noise but also more low-frequency signals. These methods are also associated with substantially lower age-related fcMRI differences. On the other hand, aCompCor and tCompCor appear to be better at removing high-frequency physiological signals but not low-frequency signal power. These methods are also associated with relatively higher age-related fcMRI differences, whether driven by neuronal signal or residual artifact. These results were reproduced in data downsampled to represent conventional fMRI sampling frequency. Lastly, methods differ in performance depending on the age group.Discussion While this study cautions direct comparisons of fcMRI results based on different denoising methods in the study of aging, it also enhances the understanding of different denoising methods in broader fcMRI applications.

Functional connectivity of fMRI using differential covariance predicts structural connectivity and behavioral reaction times	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Resting-state fMRI; Differential covariance; Human Connectome Project	RESTING-STATE FMRI; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; MODELS; SEGREGATION; INTEGRATION; NETWORKS	Author Summary Our ability to sense, think, feel and react is reflected in the activation patterns of distinct brain regions. These patterns can be observed noninvasively by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Statistical dependencies between the activities in brain regions have been widely used to measure functional connectivity (FC). However, due to common inputs from other brain areas, two correlated brain regions may not have direct neural fibers connecting them, which makes correlated activity difficult to interpret. A new method for measuring FC called differential covariance (dCov) was applied to fMRI recordings from anesthetized mice and resting human subjects. The analysis closely matched known neuronal fiber connections. In addition, dCov-FC from individual humans predicted reaction times for several types of psychological tests. Recordings from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) reflect the influence of pathways between brain areas. A wide range of methods have been proposed to measure this functional connectivity (FC), but the lack of "ground truth" has made it difficult to systematically validate them. Most measures of FC produce connectivity estimates that are symmetrical between brain areas. Differential covariance (dCov) is an algorithm for analyzing FC with directed graph edges. When we applied dCov to rs-fMRI recordings from the human connectome project (HCP) and anesthetized mice, dCov-FC accurately identified strong cortical connections from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in individual humans and viral tract tracing in mice. In addition, those HCP subjects whose dCov-FCs were more integrated, as assessed by a graph-theoretic measure, tended to have shorter reaction times in several behavioral tests. Thus, dCov-FC was able to identify anatomically verified connectivity that yielded measures of brain integration significantly correlated with behavior.

Amygdala fMRI was particularly targeted, as the amygdala's anatomical position in the ventral brain combined with strong magnetic field inhomogeneities and proximity to large vessels pose considerable obstacles for robust activation mapping. In this high-resolution study performed at ultra-high field (7T) fMRI, we aimed at (1) investigating systematic replicability of amygdala group-level activation in response to an established emotion processing task by varying task instruction and acquisition parameters and (2) testing for intra- and intersession reliability. At group-level, our results show statistically significant activation in bilateral amygdala and fusiform gyrus for each of the runs acquired. In addition, while fusiform gyrus activations are consistent across runs and sessions, amygdala activation levels show habituation effects across runs. This amygdala habituation effect is replicated in a session repeated two weeks later. Varying task instruction between matching emotions and matching persons does not change amygdala activation strength. Also, comparing two acquisition protocols with repetition times of either 700 ms or 1400 ms did not result in statistically significant differences of activation levels. Regarding within-subject reliability of amygdala activation, despite considerable variance in individual habituation patterns, we report fair to good inter-session reliability for the first run and excellent reliability for averages over runs. We conclude that high-resolution fMRI at 7T allows for robust mapping of amygdala activation in a broad range of variations. Our results of amygdala 7T fMRI are suitable to inform methodology and may encourage future studies to continue using emotion discrimination paradigms in clinical and non-clinical applications.

Several functional MRI (fMRI) studies reported widespread activation of mentalizing, salience, and executive networks when adopting the Other compared to Self perspective. This study aims to explore whether cognitive and emotional parameters impact on brain reactivity in dot perspective task (dPT). We provide here an fMRI analysis based on individual z-scores in eighty-two healthy adults who underwent the Samson's dPT after detailed assessment of fluid intelligence, attention, levels of alexithymia and social cognition abilities. Univariate regression models were used to explore the association between brain activation patterns and psychological variables. There was a strong positive association between Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and fMRI z-scores in Self perspective. When the Other perspective is taken, Continuous Performance Test (CPT)-II parameters were negatively associated with fMRI z-scores. Individuals with higher Toronto Alexithymia scale (TAS) score and lower scores in mini-Social cognition and Emotional Assessment (SEA) displayed significantly higher egocentric interference-related fMRI z-scores. Our data demonstrate that brain activation when focusing on our own perspective depends on the levels of fluid intelligence. Decreased attentional recruitment and decreased inhibitory control affects the brain efforts to adopt the Other perspective. Egocentric interference-associated brain fMRI activation was less marked in cases with better empathy abilities but the opposite was true for persons who experience increased difficulties in the recognition of emotions.

To understand the acute effects of psychedelic drugs in vivo, blood-oxy-genation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used. In particular, fMRI studies have suggested that MDMA leads to inhibition of brain activity, challenging previous hypotheses indicating mainly excitatory effects based, among others, on increased metabolism shown by 18F-FDG functional PET (fPET). However, inter-pretation of hemodynamic changes induced by psychedelics is difficult because of their potent vascular effects. Methods: We aimed to delin-eate the acute effects of MDMA using simultaneous PET/fMRI in rats. For this purpose, hemodynamic changes measured by BOLD fMRI were related to alterations in glucose utilization and serotonin trans-porter (SERT) occupancy using 18F-FDG fPET/fMRI and 11C-DASB PET/fMRI. Results: We show that MDMA induces localized increases in glucose metabolism in limbic projection areas involved in emotional processing. The increased glucose metabolism was accompanied by global cerebral and extracerebral hemodynamic decreases. We further demonstrated a strong correlation between SERT occupancies and regional BOLD reductions after acute MDMA administration. Conclusion: Our data indicate that hemodynamic decreases after acute MDMA administration are of a nonneuronal nature and initiate peripherally. Within the brain, MDMA triggers neuronal activation in lim-bic projection areas, whereas increased serotonin levels induced by SERT blockage cause neurovascular uncoupling through direct vascu-lar effects. Correct understanding of the in vivo mechanism of MDMA not only supports ongoing research but also warrants a reassessment of previous studies on neuronal effects of psychedelics relying on neu-rovascular coupling and recommends 18F-FDG fPET as a potentially more robust measure for pharmacologic research.

However, EEG data obtained from the simultaneous EEG-fMRI are strongly influenced by MRI-related artefacts, namely gradient artefacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts. When compared to the GA correction, the BCG correction is more challenging to remove due to its inherent variabilities and dynamic changes over time. The standard BCG correction (i.e., average artefact subtraction [AAS]), require detecting cardiac pulses from simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) recording. However, ECG signals are also distorted and will become problematic for detecting reliable cardiac peaks. In this study, we focused on a beamforming spatial filtering technique to attenuate all unwanted source activities outside of the brain. Specifically, we applied the beamforming technique to attenuate the BCG artefact in EEG-fMRI, and also to recover meaningful task-based neural signals during an attentional network task (ANT) which required participants to identify visual cues and respond accurately. We analysed EEG-fMRI data in 20 healthy participants during the ANT, and compared four different BCG corrections (non-BCG corrected, AAS BCG corrected, beamforming + AAS BCG corrected, beamforming BCG corrected). We demonstrated that the beamforming approach did not only significantly reduce the BCG artefacts, but also significantly recovered the expected task-based brain activity when compared to the standard AAS correction. This data-driven beamforming technique appears promising especially for longer data acquisition of sleep and resting EEG-fMRI. Our findings extend previous work regarding the recovery of meaningful EEG signals by an optimized suppression of MRI-related artefacts.

The current study urges to record and report the time of fMRI scan acquisition in future research, as it may increase the replicability of findings. Both exploratory and clinical studies would benefit by incorporating this small change in fMRI protocol, which to date has been often overlooked. Introduction: In the light of the ongoing replication crisis in the field of neuroimaging, it is necessary to assess the possible exogenous and endogenous factors that may affect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The current project investigated time-of-day effects in the spontaneous fluctuations (<0.1 Hz) of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal.Method: Using data from the human connectome project release S1200, cross-spectral density dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to analyze time-dependent effects on the hemodynamic response and effective connectivity parameters. The DCM analysis covered three networks, namely the default mode network, the central executive network, and the saliency network. Hierarchical group-parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) was used to test varying design-matrices against the time-of-day model.Results: Hierarchical group-PEB found no support for changes in effective connectivity, whereas the hemodynamic parameters exhibited a significant time-of-day dependent effect, indicating a diurnal vascular effect that might affect the measured BOLD signal in the absence of any diurnal variations of the underlying neuronal activations and effective connectivity.Conclusion: We conclude that these findings urge the need to account for the time of data acquisition in future MRI studies and suggest that time-of-day dependent metabolic variations contribute to reduced reliability in resting-state fMRI studies.

FMRI hemodynamic response function (HRF) as a novel marker of brain function: applications for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder pathology and treatment response	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI; Hemodynamic response function; HRF; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; OCD; Cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT; Machine learning	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; DYNAMIC GRANGER CAUSALITY; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; BOLD RESPONSE; STATE; VARIABILITY	The hemodynamic response function (HRF) represents the transfer function linking neural activity with the functional MRI (fMRI) signal, modeling neurovascular coupling. Since HRF is influenced by non-neural factors, to date it has largely been considered as a confound or has been ignored in many analyses. However, underlying biophysics suggests that the HRF may contain meaningful correlates of neural activity, which might be unavailable through conventional fMRI metrics. Here, we estimated the HRF by performing deconvolution on resting-state fMRI data from a longitudinal sample of 25 healthy controls scanned twice and 44 adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) before and after 4-weeks of intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). HRF response height, time-to-peak and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) in OCD were abnormal before treatment and normalized after treatment in regions including the caudate. Pre-treatment HRF predicted treatment outcome (OCD symptom reduction) with 86.4% accuracy, using machine learning. Pre-treatment HRF response height in the caudate head and time-to-peak in the caudate tail were top-predictors of treatment response. Time-to-peak in the caudate tail, a region not typically identified in OCD studies using conventional fMRI activation or connectivity measures, may carry novel importance. Additionally, pre-treatment response height in caudate head predicted post-treatment OCD severity (R = -0.48,P = 0.001), and was associated with treatment-related OCD severity changes (R = -0.44,P = 0.0028), underscoring its relevance. With HRF being a reliable marker sensitive to brain function, OCD pathology, and intervention-related changes, these results could guide future studies towards novel discoveries not possible through conventional fMRI approaches like standard BOLD activation or connectivity.

Dynamic analysis of fMRI activation during epileptic spikes can help identify the seizure origin	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						EEG; fibre tractography; fMRI; focal epilepsy; IED variability; source imaging	LOW-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; EEG-FMRI; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; FOCAL EPILEPSY; NETWORKS; TRACTOGRAPHY; COMBINATION; DISCHARGES; MODEL	Objective We use the dynamic electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) method to incorporate variability in the amplitude and field of the interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) into the fMRI analysis. We ask whether IED variability analysis can (a) identify additional activated brain regions during the course of IEDs, not seen in standard analysis; and (b) demonstrate the origin and spread of epileptic activity. We explore whether these functional changes recapitulate the structural connections and propagation of epileptic activity during seizures. Methods Seventeen patients with focal epilepsy and at least 30 IEDs of a single type during simultaneous EEG-fMRI were studied. IED variability and EEG source imaging (ESI) analysis extracted time-varying dynamic changes. General linear modeling (GLM) generated static functional maps. Dynamic maps were compared to static functional maps. The dynamic sequence from IED variability was compared to the ESI results. In a subset of patients, we investigated structural connections between active brain regions using diffusion-based fiber tractography. Results IED variability distinguished the origin of epileptic activity from its propagation in 15 of 17 (88%) patients. This included two cases where no result was obtained from the standard GLM analysis. In both of these cases, IED variability revealed activation in line with the presumed epileptic focus. Two cases showed no result from either method. Both had very high spike rates associated with dysplasia in the postcentral gyrus. In all 15 cases with dynamic activation, the observed dynamics were concordant with ESI. Fiber tractography identified specific white matter pathways between brain regions that were active at IED onset and propagation. Significance Dynamic techniques involving IED variability can provide additional power for EEG-fMRI analysis, compared to standard analysis, revealing additional biologically plausible information in cases with no result from the standard analysis and gives insight into the origin and spread of IEDs.

Changes in Hemodynamic Response Function Resulting From Chronic Alcohol Consumption	ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Hemodynamic Response Function; HRF; Undershoot; fMRI; Alcohol Use Disorder; Lifetime Drinking	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BOLD POSTSTIMULUS UNDERSHOOT; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL HYPOMETABOLISM; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; VENTRAL STRIATUM; HUMAN BRAIN; ACTIVATION; FMRI; CEREBELLAR	Background Functional MRI (fMRI) task-related analyses rely on an estimate of the brain's hemodynamic response function (HRF) to model the brain's response to events. Although changes in the HRF have been found after acute alcohol administration, the effects of heavy chronic alcohol consumption on the HRF have not been explored, and the potential benefits or pitfalls of estimating each individual's HRF on fMRI analyses of chronic alcohol use disorder (AUD) are not known. Methods Participants with AUD and controls (CTL) received structural, functional, and vascular scans. During fMRI, participants were cued to tap their fingers, and averaged responses were extracted from the motor cortex. Curve fitting on these HRFs modeled them as a difference between 2 gamma distributions, and the temporal occurrence of the main peak and undershoot of the HRF was computed from the mean of the first and second gamma distributions, respectively. Results ANOVA and regression analyses found that the timing of the HRF undershoot increased significantly as a function of total lifetime drinking. Although gray matter volume in the motor cortex decreased with lifetime drinking, this was not sufficient to explain undershoot timing shifts, and vascular factors measured in the motor cortex did not differ among groups. Comparison of random-effects analyses using custom-fitted and canonical HRFs for CTL and AUD groups showed better results throughout the brain for custom-fitted versus canonical HRFs for CTL subjects. For AUD subjects, the same was true except for the basal ganglia. Conclusions These findings suggest that excessive alcohol consumption is associated with changes in the HRF undershoot. HRF changes could provide a possible biomarker for the effects of lifetime drinking on brain function. Changes in HRF topography affect fMRI activation measures, and subject-specific HRFs generally improve fMRI activation results.

However, safety remains a crucial consideration, particularly due to the impact of the specific characteristics of icEEG and MRI technologies that were safe when used separately but may risk health when combined. Using a clinical 3-T scanner with body transmit and head-receive coils, we assessed the safety and feasibility of our icEEG-fMRI protocol. MethodsUsing platinum and platinum-iridium grid and depth electrodes implanted in a custom-made acrylic-gel phantom, we assessed safety by focusing on three factors. First, we measured radio frequency (RF)-induced heating of the electrodes during fast spin echo (FSE, as a control) and the three sequences in our icEEG-fMRI protocol. Heating was evaluated with electrodes placed orthogonal or parallel to the static magnetic field. Using the configuration with the greatest heating observed, we then measured the total heating induced in our protocol, which is a continuous 70-min icEEG-fMRI session comprising localizer, echo-planar imaging (EPI), and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequences. Second, we measured the gradient switching-induced voltage using configurations mimicking electrode implantation in the frontal and temporal lobes. Third, we assessed the gradient switching-induced electrode movement by direct visual detection and image analyses. ResultsOn average, RF-induced local heating on the icEEG electrode contacts tested were greater in the orthogonal than parallel configuration, with a maximum increase of 0.2 degrees C during EPI and 1.9 degrees C during FSE. The total local heating was below the 1 degrees C safety limit across all contacts tested during the 70-min icEEG-fMRI session. The induced voltage was within the 100-mV safety limit regardless of the configuration. No gradient switching-induced electrode displacement was observed. ConclusionWe provide evidence that the additional health risks associated with heating, neuronal stimulation, or device movement are low when acquiring fMRI at 3 T in the presence of clinical icEEG electrodes under the conditions reported in this study.

Roles of fMRI and Wada tests in the presurgical evaluation of language functions in temporal lobe epilepsy	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						intracarotid amobarbital test; functional MRI; resting-state; epilepsy surgery; naming; outcome	VERBAL MEMORY DECLINE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES; PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT; AUDITORY COMPREHENSION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; LATERALIZATION; MRI; DOMINANCE; BRAIN; LOBECTOMY	Surgical treatment of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) carries risks for language function that can significantly affect the quality of life. Predicting the risks of decline in language functions before surgery is, consequently, just as important as predicting the chances of becoming seizure-free. The intracarotid amobarbital test, generally known as the Wada test (WT), has been traditionally used to determine language lateralization and to estimate their potential decline after surgery. However, the test is invasive and it does not localize the language functions. Therefore, other noninvasive methods have been proposed, of which functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) has the greatest potential. Functional MRI allows localization of language areas. It has good concordance with the WT for language lateralization, and it is of predictive value for postsurgical naming outcomes. Consequently, fMRI has progressively replaced WT for presurgical language evaluation. The objective of this manuscript is to review the most relevant aspects of language functions in TLE and the current role of fMRI and WT in the presurgical evaluation of language. First, we will provide context by revising the language network distribution and the effects of TLE on them. Then, we will assess the functional outcomes following various forms of TLE surgery and measures to reduce postoperative language decline. Finally, we will discuss the current indications for WT and fMRI and the potential usefulness of the resting-state fMRI technique.

However, cortical depth dependent vascularization differences, such as a higher prevalence of macro-vascular compartments near the pial surface, have a confounding effect on depth-resolved blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals. In the current study, we use hypercapnic and hyperoxic breathing conditions to quantify the influence of all venous vascular and micro-vascular compartments on laminar BOLD fMRI, as measured with gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) scan sequences, respectively. We find that all venous vascular and micro-vascular compartments are capable of comparable theoretical maximum signal intensities, as represented by the M-value parameter. However, the capacity for vessel dilation, as reflected by the cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is approximately two and a half times larger for all venous vascular compartments combined compared to the micro-vasculature at superficial layers. Finally, there is roughly a 35% difference in estimates of CBV changes between all venous vascular and micro-vascular compartments, although this relative difference was approximately uniform across cortical depth. Thus, our results suggest that fMRI BOLD signal differences across cortical depth are likely caused by differences in dilation properties between macro- and micro-vascular compartments.

One application with great potential is neurofeedback training of targeted brain activity, based on the real-time analysis of the EEG and/or fMRI signals. This depends on the ability to reduce in real time the severe artifacts affecting the EEG signal acquired with fMRI, mainly the gradient and pulse artifacts. A few methods have been proposed for this purpose, but they are either slow, hardware-dependent, publicly unavailable, or proprietary software. Here, we present a fully open-source and publicly available tool for real-time EEG artifact reduction in simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings that is fast and applicable to any hardware. Our tool is integrated in the Python toolbox NeuXus for real-time EEG processing and adapts to a real-time scenario well -established artifact average subtraction methods combined with a long short-term memory network for R peak detection. We benchmarked NeuXus on three different datasets, in terms of artifact power reduction and background signal preservation in resting state, alpha-band power reactivity to eyes closure, and event-related desynchronization during motor imagery. We showed that NeuXus performed at least as well as the only available real-time tool for conventional hardware setups (BrainVision's RecView) and a well-established offline tool (EEGLAB's FMRIB plugin). We also demonstrated NeuXus' real-time ability by reporting execution times under 250 ms. In conclusion, we present and validate the first fully open-source and hardware-independent solution for real-time artifact reduction in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies.

Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI: A dataset for comparison of radiotracer administration for high temporal resolution functional FDG-PET	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article; Data Paper						simultaneous PET; MR; functional PET; functional MRI; fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography; blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging; radiotracer administration; human neuroscience; human neuroimaging	GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; MOTION CORRECTION; BRAIN; ROBUST; RECONSTRUCTION; METABOLISM	Background "Functional" [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-fPET) is a new approach for measuring glucose uptake in the human brain. The goal of FDG-fPET is to maintain a constant plasma supply of radioactive FDG in order to track, with high temporal resolution, the dynamic uptake of glucose during neuronal activity that occurs in response to a task or at rest. FDG-fPET has most often been applied in simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET (blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI fluorodeoxyglucose functional positron emission tomography) imaging. BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET provides the capability to image the 2 primary sources of energetic dynamics in the brain, the cerebrovascular haemodynamic response and cerebral glucose uptake. Findings In this Data Note, we describe an open access dataset, Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI, which contrasts 3 radiotracer administration protocols for FDG-fPET: bolus, constant infusion, and hybrid bolus/infusion. Participants (n = 5 in each group) were randomly assigned to each radiotracer administration protocol and underwent simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET scanning while viewing a flickering checkerboard. The bolus group received the full FDG dose in a standard bolus administration, the infusion group received the full FDG dose as a slow infusion over the duration of the scan, and the bolus-infusion group received 50% of the FDG dose as bolus and 50% as constant infusion. We validate the dataset by contrasting plasma radioactivity, grey matter mean uptake, and task-related activity in the visual cortex. Conclusions The Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI dataset provides significant reuse value for researchers interested in the comparison of signal dynamics in fPET, and its relationship with fMRI task-evoked activity.

However, the current diagnosis method of ASD still adopts the subjective symptom-based criteria through clinical observation, which is time-consuming and costly. In recent years, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging techniques have emerged to facilitate the identification of potential biomarkers for diagnosing ASD. In this study, we developed a deep learning framework named spatial-temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer) to distinguish ASD subjects from typical controls based on fMRI data. Specifically, a linear spatial-temporal multi-headed attention unit is proposed to obtain the spatial and temporal representation of fMRI data. Moreover, a Gaussian GAN-based data balancing method is introduced to solve the data unbalance problem in real-world ASD datasets for subtype ASD diagnosis. Our proposed ST-Transformer is evaluated on a large cohort of subjects from two independent datasets (ABIDE I and ABIDE II) and achieves robust accuracies of 71.0% and 70.6%, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our results demonstrate competitive performance in ASD diagnosis.

METHODS: PD subjects with optimized DBS programming underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Frequency was altered and fMRI scans/Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor subunit (UPDRS-III) scores were obtained. Analysis using DBS-OFF data was used to determine which regions were activated during DBS-ON. Peak activity utilizing T-values was obtained and compared. RESULTS: At clinically optimized settings (n = 14 subjects), thalamic, globus pallidum externa (GPe), and posterior cerebellum activation were present. Activation levels significantly decreased in the thalamus, anterior cerebellum, and the GPe when frequency was decreased (P < .001). Primary somatosensory cortex activation levels significantly decreased when frequency was increased by 30 Hz, but not 60 Hz. Sex, age, disease/DBS duration, and bilaterality did not significantly affect the data. Retrospective analysis of fMRI activation patterns predicted optimal frequency in 11/14 subjects. CONCLUSION: We show the first data with fMRI of STN DBS-ON while synchronizing cycling with magnetic resonance scanning. At clinically optimized settings, an fMRI signature of thalamic, GPe, and posterior cerebellum activation was seen. Reducing frequency significantly decreased thalamic, GPe, and anterior cerebellum activation. Current standard-of-care programming can take up to 6 mo using UPDRS-III testing alone. We provide preliminary evidence that using fMRI signature of frequency may have clinical utility and feasibility.

Development of a combined, sequential real-time fMRI and fNIRS neurofeedback system to enhance motor learning after stroke	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						BCI; Neural feedback; Biofeedback; BMI; Stroke; MRI; NIRS; motor control; Coordination	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; HEALTH-RELATED-QUALITY; CORTEX ACTIVITY; ABILITY TEST; ARM FUNCTION; RECOVERY; REHABILITATION; ROBOTICS; PATIENT	Background: After stroke, wrist extension dyscoordination precludes functional arm/hand. We developed a more spatially precise brain signal for use in brain computer interface (BCI's) for stroke survivors. New method: Combination BCI protocol of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) sequentially followed by functional near infrared spectroscopy (rt-fNIRS) neurofeedback, interleaved with motor learning sessions without neural feedback. Custom Matlab and Python code was developed to provide rt-fNIRS-based feedback to the chronic stroke survivor, system user. Results: The user achieved a maximum of 71 % brain signal accuracy during rt-fNIRS neural training; progressive focus of brain activation across rt-fMRI neural training; increasing trend of brain signal amplitude during wrist extension across rt-fNIRS training; and clinically significant recovery of arm coordination and active wrist extension. Comparison with existing methods: Neurorehabilitation, peripherally directed, shows limited efficacy, as do EEG-based BCIs, for motor recovery of moderate/severely impaired stroke survivors. EEG-based BCIs are based on electrophysiological signal; whereas, rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS are based on neurovascular signal. Conclusion: The system functioned well during user testing. Methods are detailed for others' use. The system user successfully engaged rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS neurofeedback systems, modulated brain signal during rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS training, according to volume of brain activation and intensity of signal, respectively, and clinically significantly improved limb coordination and active wrist extension. fNIRS use in this case demonstrates a feasible/practical BCI system for further study with regard to use in chronic stroke rehab, and fMRI worked in concept, but cost and some patient-use issues make it less feasible for clinical practice.

In this context, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the results of these studies.Design: The studies research was performed on 3 online databases, examining English-written articles published before August 5, 2022, that performed a two-class ML classification using rs-fMRI features. The search resulted in 20 eligible studies.Results: The reviewed studies showed good performance metrics, with better performance achieved when the dataset was restricted to a more homogeneous group in terms of disease severity. Regions within the default mode network, salience network, and central executive network were reported as the most important features in the classification algorithms. Limitations: The small sample size together with the methodological and clinical heterogeneity limited the generalizability of the findings.Conclusions: In conclusion, ML applied to rs-fMRI features can be a valid approach to classify MDD and HC subjects and to discover features that can be used for additional investigation of the pathophysiology of the disease.

However, the use of non-invasive techniques to detect brain signals to evaluate the cognitive activity of people with Down syndrome (DS) has not been sufficiently addressed. The objective of this study is to describe the state-of-the-art in fMRI techniques for recording brain signals in people with DS. Method: A systematic review was performed based on PRISMA recommendations; only nine papers on this topic have been published. Three independent researchers selected all relevant information from each paper. Analyses of information concordance showed a high value of agreement between researchers. Results: Although few relevant works have been published, the use of fMRI in people with DS is becoming an appropriate option to study brain function in this population. Of the nine identified papers, five used task designs, and four used resting-state paradigms. Conclusion: Thus, we emphasize the need to incorporate rigorous cognitive activity procedures in evaluations of the DS population. We suggest several factors (such as head correction movements and paired sample techniques) that must be considered when designing an fMRI study with a task or a resting-state paradigm in a DS population.

Our aims were to propose a truly objective and quantitative comparison between EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging (EMSI), EEG/fMRI responses for similar spikes with primary irritative zone (PIZ) and SOZ defined by SEEG and to evaluate the value of EMSI and EEG/fMRI to predict postsurgical outcome. Methods We identified patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent EEG/MEG, EEG/fMRI, and subsequent SEEG at the Epilepsy Service from the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. We quantified multimodal concordance within the SEEG channel space as spatial overlap with PIZ/SOZ and distances to the spike-onset, spike maximum amplitude and seizure core intracerebral channels by applying a new methodology consisting of converting EMSI results into SEEG electrical potentials (EMSIe-SEEG) and projecting the most significant fMRI response on the SEEG channels (fMRIp-SEEG). Spatial overlaps with PIZ/SOZ (AUC(PIZ), AUC(SOZ)) were assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Here, AUC represents the probability that a randomly picked active contact exhibited higher amplitude when located inside the spatial reference than outside. Results Seventeen patients were included. Mean spatial overlaps with the PIZ and SOZ were 0.71 and 0.65 for EMSIe-SEEG and 0.57 and 0.62 for fMRIp-SEEG. Good EMSIe-SEEG spatial overlap with the PIZ was associated with smaller distance from the maximum EMSIe-SEEG contact to the spike maximum amplitude channel (median distance 14 mm). Conversely, good fMRIp-SEEG spatial overlap with the SOZ was associated with smaller distances from the maximum fMRIp-SEEG contact to the spike-onset and seizure core channels (median distances 10 and 5 mm, respectively). Surgical outcomes were correctly predicted by EEG/MEG in 12 of 15 (80%) patients and EEG/fMRI in 6 of 11(54%) patients. Discussion With the use of a unique quantitative approach estimating EMSI and fMRI results in the reference SEEG channel space, EEG/MEG and EEG/fMRI accurately localized the SOZ and the PIZ. Precisely, EEG/MEG more accurately localized the PIZ, whereas EEG/fMRI was more sensitive to the SOZ. Both neuroimaging techniques provide complementary localization that can help guide SEEG implantation and select good candidates for surgery.

However, head-to-head comparisons between EC and FC from either task-based or resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data are rare, especially in terms of how they associate with salient aspects of brain health. MethodsIn this study, 100 cognitively-healthy participants in the Bogalusa Heart Study aged 54.2 +/- 4.3years completed Stroop task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI. EC and FC among 24 regions of interest (ROIs) previously identified as involved in Stroop task execution (EC-task and FC-task) and among 33 default mode network ROIs (EC-rest and FC-rest) were calculated from task-based and resting-state fMRI using deep stacking networks and Pearson correlation. The EC and FC measures were thresholded to generate directed and undirected graphs, from which standard graph metrics were calculated. Linear regression models related graph metrics to demographic, cardiometabolic risk factors, and cognitive function measures. ResultsWomen and whites (compared to men and African Americans) had better EC-task metrics, and better EC-task metrics associated with lower blood pressure, white matter hyperintensity volume, and higher vocabulary score (maximum value of p = 0.043). Women had better FC-task metrics, and better FC-task metrics associated with APOE-epsilon 4 3-3 genotype and better hemoglobin-A1c, white matter hyperintensity volume and digit span backwards score (maximum value of p = 0.047). Better EC rest metrics associated with lower age, non-drinker status, and better BMI, white matter hyperintensity volume, logical memory II total score, and word reading score (maximum value of p = 0.044). Women and non-drinkers had better FC-rest metrics (value of p = 0.004). DiscussionIn a diverse, cognitively healthy, middle-aged community sample, EC and FC based graph metrics from task-based fMRI data, and EC based graph metrics from resting-state fMRI data, were associated with recognized indicators of brain health in differing ways. Future studies of brain health should consider taking both task-based and resting-state fMRI scans and measuring both EC and FC analyses to get a more complete picture of functional networks relevant to brain health.

The prosocial effects of OXT acting in the CNS present it as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of aspects of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this article, we systematically review the functional MRI (fMRI) literature that reports task-state and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies of the neural effects of single or multiple dose intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) administration in individuals with ASD. Method: We searched four databases for relevant documents (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) using the keywords "autism spectrum disorder", "Asperger Syndrome", "oxytocin", and "fMRI". Moreover, we made a manual search to assess the quality of our automatic search. The search was confined to English language articles published in the interval February 2013 until March 2021. Results: The search yielded 12 fMRI studies with OXT intervention, including 288 individuals with ASD (age 8-55 years) enrolled in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel designs, within-subject-crossover experimental OXT trials. Studies reporting activation task and rsfMRI were summarized with region of interest (ROI) or whole-brain voxel wise analysis. The systematic review of the 12 studies supported the proposition that IN-OXT administration alters brain activation in individuals with ASD. The effects of IN-OXT interacted with the type of the task and the overall results did not indicate restoration of normal brain activation in ASD signature regions albeit the lack of statistical evidence. Conclusion: A large body of evidence consistently indicates that OXT alters activation to fMRI in brain networks of individuals with ASD, but with uncertain implications for alleviation of their social deficits.

Reliability and stability challenges in ABCD task fMRI data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; HEAD MOTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; WORKING-MEMORY; CONNECTIVITY; AMYGDALA; REWARD; ACTIVATION; PARCELLATION; METAANALYSIS	Trait stability of measures is an essential requirement for individual differences research. Functional MRI has been increasingly used in studies that rely on the assumption of trait stability, such as attempts to relate task related brain activation to individual differences in behavior and psychopathology. However, recent research using adult samples has questioned the trait stability of task-fMRI measures, as assessed by test-retest correlations. To date, little is known about trait stability of task fMRI in children. Here, we examined within-session reliability and long-term stability of individual differences in task-fMRI measures using fMRI measures of brain activation provided by the adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) Study Release v4.0 as an individual's average regional activity, using its tasks focused on reward processing, response inhibition, and working memory. We also evaluated the effects of factors potentially affecting reliability and stability. Reliability and stability (quantified as the ratio of non-scanner related stable variance to all variances) was poor in virtually all brain regions, with an average value of 0.088 and 0.072 for short term (within-session) reliability and long-term (between-session) stability, respectively, in regions of interest (ROIs) historically-recruited by the tasks. Only one reliability or stability value in ROIs exceeded the 'poor' cut-offof 0.4, and in fact rarely exceeded 0.2 (only 4.9%). Motion had a pronounced effect on estimated reliability/stability, with the lowest motion quartile of participants having a mean reliability/stability 2.5 times higher (albeit still 'poor') than the highest motion quartile. Poor reliability and stability of task-fMRI, particularly in children, diminishes potential utility of fMRI data due to a drastic reduction of effect sizes and, consequently, statistical power for the detection of brain-behavior associations. This essential issue urgently needs to be addressed through optimization of task design, scanning parameters, data acquisition protocols, preprocessing pipelines, and data denoising methods.

Temporal consistency of neurovascular components on awakening: preliminary evidence from electroencephalography, cerebrovascular reactivity, and functional magnetic resonance imaging	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						sleep; sleep inertia; simultaneous EEG-fMRI; psychomotor vigilance task; cerebrovascular reactivity; neurovascular coupling; EEG power	SLEEP INERTIA; BRAIN; EEG; SOFTWARE; DYNAMICS; MRI	Sleep inertia (SI) is a time period during the transition from sleep to wakefulness wherein individuals perceive low vigilance with cognitive impairments; SI is generally identified by longer reaction times (RTs) in attention tasks immediately after awakening followed by a gradual RT reduction along with waking time. The sluggish recovery of vigilance in SI involves a dynamic process of brain functions, as evidenced in recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in within-network and between-network connectivity. However, these fMRI findings were generally based on the presumption of unchanged neurovascular coupling (NVC) before and after sleep, which remains an uncertain factor to be investigated. Therefore, we recruited 12 young participants to perform a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and a breath-hold task of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) before sleep and thrice after awakening (A1, A2, and A3, with 20 min intervals in between) using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI recordings. If the NVC were to hold in SI, we hypothesized that time-varying consistencies could be found between the fMRI response and EEG beta power, but not in neuron-irrelevant CVR. Results showed that the reduced accuracy and increased RT in the PVT upon awakening was consistent with the temporal patterns of the PVT-induced fMRI responses (thalamus, insula, and primary motor cortex) and the EEG beta power (Pz and CP1). The neuron-irrelevant CVR did not show the same time-varying pattern among the brain regions associated with PVT. Our findings imply that the temporal dynamics of fMRI indices upon awakening are dominated by neural activities. This is the first study to explore the temporal consistencies of neurovascular components on awakening, and the discovery provides a neurophysiological basis for further neuroimaging studies regarding SI.

J	Wang, YW; Chen, X; Yan, CG				Wang, Yu-Wei; Chen, Xiao; Yan, Chao-Gan			Comprehensive evaluation of harmonization on functional brain imaging for multisite data-fusion	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Comparison; Harmonization; Multi-site pooling; Resting-state fMRI	RESTING-STATE FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; CONNECTOMICS; REGISTRATION; PREDICTION; MOTION; ROBUST; POWER	To embrace big-data neuroimaging, harmonizing the site effect in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data fusion is a fundamental challenge. A comprehensive evaluation of potentially effective harmonization strategies, particularly with specifically collected data, has been scarce, especially for R-fMRI metrics. Here, we comprehensively assess harmonization strategies from multiple perspectives, including tests on residual site effect, individual identification, test-retest reliability, and replicability of group-level statisti-cal results, on widely used R-fMRI metrics across various datasets, including data obtained from participants with repetitive measures at different scanners. For individual identifiability (i.e., whether the same subject could be identified across R-fMRI data scanned across different sites), we found that, while most methods decreased site effects, the Subsampling Maximum-mean-distance based distribution shift correction Algorithm (SMA) and parametric unadjusted CovBat outperformed linear regression models, linear mixed models, ComBat series and invariant conditional variational auto-encoder in clustering accuracy. Test-retest reliability was better for SMA and parametric adjusted CovBat than unadjusted ComBat series and parametric unadjusted CovBat in the number of overlapped voxels. At the same time, SMA was superior to the latter in replicability in terms of the Dice coef-ficient and the scale of brain areas showing sex differences reproducibly observed across datasets. Furthermore, SMA better detected reproducible sex differences of ALFF under the site-sex confounded situation. Moreover, we designed experiments to identify the best target site features to optimize SMA identifiability, test-retest reliabil-ity, and stability. We noted both sample size and distribution of the target site matter and introduced a heuristic formula for selecting the target site. In addition to providing practical guidelines, this work can inform continuing improvements and innovations in harmonizing methodologies for big R-fMRI data.

Characteristics of respiratory measures in young adults scanned at rest, including systematic changes and "missed" deep breaths	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; END-TIDAL CO2; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSE FUNCTION; FMRI; FLUCTUATIONS; SIGNAL; SLEEP; DYNAMICS; WAKEFULNESS	Breathing rate and depth influence the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood, altering cerebral blood flow and thus functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Such respiratory fluctuations can have substantial influence in studies of fMRI signal covariance in subjects at rest, the so-called "resting state functional connectivity" technique. If respiration is monitored during fMRI scanning, it is typically done using a belt about the subject's abdomen to record abdominal circumference. Several measures have been derived from these belt records, including the windowed envelope of the waveform (ENV), the windowed variance in the waveform (respiration variation, RV), and a measure of the amplitude of each breath divided by the cycle time of the breath (respiration volume per time, RVT). Any attempt to gauge respiratory contributions to fMRI signals requires a respiratory measure, but little is known about how these measures compare to each other, or how they perform beyond the small studies in which they were initially proposed. Here, we examine the properties of these measures in hundreds of healthy young adults scanned for an hour each at rest, a subset of the Human Connectome Project chosen for having high-quality physiological records. We find: 1) ENV, RV, and RVT are all correlated, and ENV and RV are more highly correlated to each other than to RVT; 2) respiratory events like deep breaths exhibit characteristic heart rate elevations, fMRI signal changes, head motions, and image quality abnormalities time-locked to large deflections in the belt traces; 3) all measures can "miss" deep breaths; 4) RVT "misses" deep breaths more than ENV or RV; 5) all respiratory measures change systematically over the course of a 14.4-min scan. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature and ways to move forward in modeling respiratory influences on fMRI scans.

Brain motion networks predict head motion during rest- and task-fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						head motion; fMRI; proprioception; self-motion perception; hyperactivity; impulsivity; machine learning	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MRI; IMPACT; ORGANIZATION; PARCELLATION; REGRESSION; ARTIFACTS; PATTERNS; CORTEX; ROBUST	IntroductionThe capacity to stay still during scanning, which is necessary to avoid motion confounds while imaging, varies markedly between people. MethodsHere we investigated the effect of head motion on functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and publicly available brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 414 individuals with low frame-to-frame motion (Delta d < 0.18 mm). Leave-one-out was used for internal cross-validation of head motion prediction in 207 participants, and twofold cross-validation was used in an independent sample (n = 207). Results and DiscussionParametric testing, as well as CPM-based permutations for null hypothesis testing, revealed strong linear associations between observed and predicted values of head motion. Motion prediction accuracy was higher for task- than for rest-fMRI, and for absolute head motion (d) than for Delta d. Denoising attenuated the predictability of head motion, but stricter framewise displacement threshold (FD = 0.2 mm) for motion censoring did not alter the accuracy of the predictions obtained with lenient censoring (FD = 0.5 mm). For rest-fMRI, prediction accuracy was lower for individuals with low motion (mean Delta d < 0.02 mm; n = 200) than for those with moderate motion (Delta d < 0.04 mm; n = 414). The cerebellum and default-mode network (DMN) regions that forecasted individual differences in d and Delta d during six different tasks- and two rest-fMRI sessions were consistently prone to the deleterious effect of head motion. However, these findings generalized to a novel group of 1,422 individuals but not to simulated datasets without neurobiological contributions, suggesting that cerebellar and DMN connectivity could partially reflect functional signals pertaining to inhibitory motor control during fMRI.

Testing an Adapted Auditory Verbal Learning Test Paradigm for fMRI to Lateralize Verbal Memory in Patients with Epilepsy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; LANGUAGE DOMINANCE; LEFT-HEMISPHERE; REORGANIZATION; ANTERIOR; SURGERY; PERFORMANCE; SHIFT	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE fMRI is a noninvasive tool for predicting postsurgical deficits in candidates with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We aimed to test an adapted paradigm of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test to evaluate differences in memory laterality indexes between patients and healthy controls and its association with neuropsychological scores. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 50 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and 22 healthy controls. Participants underwent a block design language and memory fMRI. Laterality indexes and the hippocampal anterior-posterior index were calculated. Language and memory lateralization was organized into typical and atypical on the basis of laterality indexes. A neuropsychological assessment was performed with a median time from fMRI of 8 months and was compared with fMRI performance. RESULTS: We studied 40 patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy and 10 with right temporal lobe epilepsy. Typical language occurred in 653% of patients and 90.9% of healthy controls (P = .04). The memory fMRI laterality index was obtained in all healthy controls and 92% of patients. The verbal memory laterality index was bilateral (243%) more frequently than the language laterality index (7.69%) in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy. Atypical verbal memory was greater in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (56.8%) than in healthy controls (36.4%), and the proportion of bilateral laterality indexes (53.3%) was larger than right laterality indexes (46.7%). Atypical verbal memory might be associated with higher cognitive scores in patients. No relevant differences were seen in the hippocampal anterior-posterior index according to memory impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The adapted Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test paradigm fMRI might support verbal memory lateralization. Temporal lobe epilepsy laterality influences hippocampal memory laterality indexes. Left temporal lobe epilepsy has shown a higher proportion of atypical verbal memory compared with language, potentially to memory functional reorganization.

A common technique to localize eloquent areas is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In tumors involving the peri-rolandic regions, the finger tapping task (FTT) is typically administered to delineate the functional activation of hand-knob area. However, its selectivity may be limited. Thus, here, a novel cue-induced fMRI task was tested, the visual-triggered finger movement task (VFMT), aimed at eliciting a more accurate functional cortical mapping of the hand region as compared with FTT. Method: Twenty patients with glioma in the peri-rolandic regions underwent pre-operative mapping performing both FTT and VFMT. The fMRI data were analyzed for surgical procedures. When the craniotomy allowed to expose the motor cortex, the correspondence with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) was evaluated through sensitivity and specificity (mean sites = 11) calculated as percentage of true-positive and true-negative rates, respectively. Results: Both at group level and at single-subject level, differences among the tasks emerged in the functional representation of the hand-knob. Compared with FTT, VFMT showed a well-localized activation within the hand motor area and a less widespread activation in associative regions. Intraoperative DES confirmed the greater specificity (97%) and sensitivity (100%) of the VFMT in determining motor eloquent areas. Conclusion: The study provides a novel, external-triggered fMRI task for pre-surgical motor mapping. Compared with the traditional FTT, the new VFMT may have potential implications in clinical fMRI and surgical management due to its focal identification of the hand-knob region and good correspondence to intraoperative DES.

As arterial stiffening is a known age-related cardiovascular risk factor, we investigated the associations between aortic stiffening (as measured using pulse-wave velocity [PWV]) and rs-fMRI metrics. We used cardiac MRI to measure aortic PWV (an established indicator of whole-body vascular stiffness), as well as dual-echo pseudo-continuous arterial-spin labeling to measure BOLD and CBF dynamics simultaneously in a group of generally healthy adults. We found that: (1) higher aortic PWV is associated with lower variance in the resting-state BOLD signal; (2) higher PWV is also associated with lower BOLD-based resting-state functional connectivity; (3) regions showing lower connectivity do not fully overlap with those showing lower BOLD variance with higher PWV; (4) CBF signal variance is a significant mediator of the above findings, only when averaged across regions-of-interest. Furthermore, we found no significant association between BOLD signal variance and systolic blood pressure, which is also a known predictor of vascular stiffness. Age-related vascular stiffness, as measured by PWV, provides a unique scenario to demonstrate the extent of vascular bias in rs-fMRI signal fluctuations and functional connectivity. These findings suggest that a substantial portion of age-related rs-fMRI differences may be driven by vascular effects rather than directly by brain function.

A coherent pattern of low frequency hemodynamic oscillations and CSF movement was recently found during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep via functional MRI. This finding raises other fundamental questions: 1) the explanation of coupling between hemodynamic oscillations and CSF movement from fMRI signals; 2) the existence of the coupling during wakefulness; 3) the direction of CSF movement. In this resting state fMRI study, we proposed a mechanical model to explain the coupling between hemodynamics and CSF movement through the lens of fMRI. Time delays between CSF movement and global hemodynamics were calculated. The observed delays between hemodynamics and CSF movement match those predicted by the model. Moreover, by conducting separate fMRI scans of the brain and neck, we confirmed the low frequency CSF movement at the fourth ventricle is bidirectional. Our finding also demonstrates that CSF movement is facilitated by changes in cerebral blood volume mainly in the low frequency range, even when the individual is awake.

Objective: This study investigated clinical, cognitive and functional brain correlates of dual-task deficits in PDPIGD patients using quantitative gait analysis, neuropsychological evaluations and functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Twenty-three PD-PIGD patients performed a clinical assessment of gait/balance abilities. Single and dual-task Timed-Up-and-Go tests were monitored using an optoelectronic system to study turning velocity. Patients underwent executive-attentive function evaluation and two fMRI tasks: motor-task (foot anti-phase movements), and dual-task (foot anti-phase movements while counting backwards by threes starting from 100). Twenty-three healthy subjects underwent neuropsychological and fMRI assessments. Results: Dual-task in PD-PIGD patients resulted in worse gait performance, particularly during turning. Performing the dual-task relative to the motor-fMRI task, healthy subjects showed widespread increased recruitment of sensorimotor, cognitive and cerebellar areas and reduced activity of inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri, while PD-PIGD patients showed increased recruitment of inferior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area and reduced activity of primary motor, supramarginal and caudate areas. Dual-task gait alterations in patients correlated with balance and executive deficits and with altered dual-task fMRI brain activity of frontal areas. Conclusions: This study suggested the correlation between dual-task gait difficulties, postural instability and executive dysfunction in PD-PIGD patients. FMRI results suggest that an optimized recruitment of motor and cognitive networks is associated with a better dual-task performance in PD-PIGD. Future studies should evaluate the effect of specific gait/balance and dual-task trainings to improve gait parameters and optimize brain functional activity during dual-tasks.

While rs-fMRI multi-site data can help to understand the inner working of the brain, the data acquisition and processing of this data has many challenges. One of the challenges is the variability of the data associated with different acquisitions sites, and different MRI machines vendors. Other factors such as population heterogeneity among different sites, with variables such as age and gender of the subjects, must also be considered. Given that most of the machine-learning models are developed using these rs-fMRI multi-site data sets, the intrinsic confounding effects can adversely affect the generalizability and reliability of these computational methods, as well as the imposition of upper limits on the classification scores. This work aims to identify the phenotypic and imaging variables producing the confounding effects, as well as to control these effects. Our goal is to maximize the classification scores obtained from the machine learning analysis of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) rs-fMRI multi-site data. To achieve this goal, we propose novel methods of stratification to produce homogeneous sub-samples of the 17 ABIDE sites, as well as the generation of new features from the static functional connectivity values, using multiple linear regression models, ComBat harmonization models, and normalization methods. The main results obtained with our statistical models and methods are an accuracy of 76.4%, sensitivity of 82.9%, and specificity of 77.0%, which are 8.8%, 20.5%, and 7.5% above the baseline classification scores obtained from the machine learning analysis of the static functional connectivity computed from the ABIDE rs-fMRI multi-site data.

Various methods have been developed that combine fMRI data derived at different echo times to improve data quality. Here, we evaluated five multi-echo combination schemes: 'optimal combination' (OC, T-2* -weighted), T-2* -FIT (T-2*-weighted, calculated per volume), average-weighted (Avg), temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) weighted, and temporal Contrast-to-Noise Ratio weighted combination. The effect of these combinations, with and without additional postprocessing, on the quality of functional resting-state networks was assessed. Sixteen healthy volunteers were scanned during a 5-minutes resting-state fMRI session. After network extraction, several quality metrics in the temporal and spatial domain were calculated for their respective time-series and spatial maps. Our results showed that OC and T-2* -FIT outperformed the other methods in both domains. Whereas the OC and T-2* -FIT time-series were found to be the least associated with artifacts, OC resulted in the highest quality spatial maps. Furthermore, spatial smoothing, bandpass filtering and ICA-AROMA merely improved networks derived from the least performing combinations (Avg and tSNR). Because similar network quality was obtained following OC and T-2* -FIT without postprocessing, we recommend future studies to implement these combinations without these postprocessing steps. This minimizes the amount of image modifications and processing, potentially leading to enhanced BOLD contrast. The results highlight the benefits of T-2*-weighted multi-echo combinations on resting-state network quality and raise its potential value in dynamic fMRI analyses or for diagnosis and prognosis purposes of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Therefore, it constitutes a desirable neural target for brain-guided interventions such as neurofeedback (NF). To date, rIFG-NF has shown beneficial ability to rehabilitate or enhance cognitive functions using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI-NF). However, the utilization of fMRI-NF for clinical purposes is severely limited, due to its poor scalability. The present study aimed to overcome the limited applicability of fMRI-NF by developing and validating an EEG model of fMRI-defined rIFG activity (hereby termed "Electrical FingerPrint of rIFG"; rIFG-EFP). To validate the computational model, we employed two experiments in healthy individuals. The first study (n = 14) aimed to test the target engagement of the model by employing rIFG-EFP-NF training while simultaneously acquiring fMRI. The second study (n = 41) aimed to test the functional outcome of two sessions of rIFG-EFP-NF using a risk preference task (known to depict cognitive control processes), employed before and after the training. Results from the first study demonstrated neural target engagement as expected, showing associated rIFG-BOLD signal changing during simultaneous rIFG-EFP-NF training. Target anatomical specificity was verified by showing a more precise prediction of the rIFG-BOLD by the rIFG-EFP model compared to other EFP models. Results of the second study suggested that successful learning to up-regulate the rIFG-EFP signal through NF can reduce one's tendency for risk taking, indicating improved cognitive control after two sessions of rIFG-EFP-NF. Overall, our results confirm the validity of a scalable NF method for targeting rIFG activity by using an EEG probe.

Although the sliding window (SW) method is popular for DFC analysis, the selection of window length is hard, and the temporal resolution is limited by the window length. The hidden Markov model (HMM) without the limitation of window length has been proven to be able to estimate time-varying brain states from fMRI data. However, HMM tends to be overfitted in DFC analysis of fMRI data because of the high spatial dimension and the limited sample size of fMRI data. In this study, we proposed an alternating HMM (aHMM) method that used the functional connectivity estimation of SW to initialize the covariance matrix of HMM and adopted an alternating HMM procedure to reduce the number of parameters during each optimization. The simulated and real fMRI resting data from the Human Connectome Projects showed that aHMM produced better robustness to noise, parameter number and sample size in DFC estimation than SW and HMM. For the real fMRI resting data of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), results of aHMM revealed that amnesia and mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) caused the CSVD with aMCI (CSVD-aMCI) group tended to spend more time on the brain state with overall weak connections and less time on the state with overall strong connections than the CSVD-controls. Moreover, CSVD-aMCI showed significantly lower connectivity amplitude and higher connectivity fluctuation than CSVD-control. In contrast, HMM did not detect intergroup differences of the connectivity amplitude and fluctuations and SW did not detect intergroup differences of connectivity fluctuations and fraction of time. The results further indicated that aHMM outperformed HMM and SW in detecting inter-group differences of temporal properties of DFC and connectivity fluctuations.

Methods Twenty-eight CP patients (median age 34.5 [29.0-39.5] years) were investigated at median 20.5 (16.3-28.8) years after treatment with surgical resection and in some cases additional radiotherapy (n = 10) and compared to 29 matched controls (median age 37.0 [32.5-42.0] years). The subjects performed the MSIT during fMRI acquisition and behavioral performance in terms of response times (ms) and accuracy performance (%) were recorded. Results The MSIT activated the cingulo-fronto-parietal (CFP) attention network in both CP patients and controls. No differences were found in behavioral performance nor fMRI activity between CP patients (interference effect 333.9 [287.3-367.1] ms and 3.1 [1.6-5.6]%, respectively) and controls (309.1 [276.4-361.0] ms and 2.6 [1.6-4.9]%). No differences were found in behavioral performance nor fMRI activity between the two subgroups with (332.0 [283.6-353.4] ms and 4.2 [2.3-5.7]%, respectively) and without hypothalamic injury (355.7 [293.7-388.7] ms and 2.1 [1.0-5.2]%, respectively), respectively, and controls. Conclusion Adults with childhood CP performed cognitive interference processing equally well as controls and demonstrated no compensatory fMRI activity in the CFP attention network compared to controls. This was also true for the two subgroups with and without hypothalamic injury. The results can be useful to better characterize this condition, and to optimize treatment and support for these individuals.

A novel fMRI-based visual decoding framework	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fMRI; visual perception decoding; recurrent neural networks (RNNs)	NATURAL IMAGES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; REPRESENTATION; SELECTION; PATTERNS	Objective.Visual perception decoding plays an important role in understanding our visual systems. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have made great advances in predicting the visual content of the single stimulus from the evoked response. In this work, we proposed a novel framework to extend previous works by simultaneously decoding the temporal and category information of visual stimuli from fMRI activities.Approach.3 T fMRI data of five volunteers were acquired while they were viewing five categories of natural images with random presentation intervals. For each subject, we trained two classification-based decoding modules that were used to identify the occurrence time and semantic categories of the visual stimuli. In each module, we adopted recurrent neural network (RNN), which has proven to be highly effective for learning nonlinear representations from sequential data, for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of fMRI activity patterns. Finally, we integrated the two modules into a complete framework.Main results.The proposed framework shows promising decoding performance. The average decoding accuracy across five subjects was over 19 times the chance level. Moreover, we compared the decoding performance of the early visual cortex (eVC) and the high-level visual cortex (hVC). The comparison results indicated that both eVC and hVC participated in processing visual stimuli, but the semantic information of the visual stimuli was mainly represented in hVC.Significance.The proposed framework advances the decoding of visual experiences and facilitates a better understanding of our visual functions.

However, its central mechanism is still not developed into a unified standard, and it is generally believed that the central mechanism is regulation of the cortical striatum thalamic neural pathway of the limbic system. In recent years, some scholars have applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the central mechanism and the associated brain effects of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment for depression. This study reviews the acupuncture and moxibustion treatment of depression from two aspects: (1) fMRI study of the brain function related to the acupuncture treatment of depression: different acupuncture and moxibustion methods are summarized, the fMRI technique is elaborately explained, and the results of fMRI study of the effects of acupuncture are analyzed in detail, and (2) fMRI associated "brain functional network" effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on depression, including the effects on the hippocampus, the amygdala, the cingulate gyrus, the frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and other brain regions. The study of the effects of acupuncture on brain imaging is not adequately developed and still needs further improvement and development. The brain function networks associated with the acupuncture treatment of depression have not yet been adequately developed to provide a scientific and standardized mechanism of the effects of acupuncture. For this purpose, this study analyzes in-depth the clinical studies on the treatment of anxiety and depression by acupuncture and moxibustion, by depicting how the employment of fMRI technology provides significant imaging changes in the brain regions. Therefore, the study also provides a reference for future clinical research on the treatment of anxiety and depression.	[Wong, Kelvin K.

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) proposed a new cortical parcellation that has not been thoroughly tested in a clinical setting. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation of fMRI and DES mapping with HCP areas in a clinical setting, and to evaluate the performance of fMRI mapping in motor and language tasks in patients with glioma, using DES as the gold standard. METHODS Forty patients with supratentorial gliomas were examined using preoperative fMRI and underwent awake craniotomy with DES. Functional activation maps were visualized on a 3D representation of the cortex, classified according to HCP areas, and compared with surgical mapping. RESULTS Functional MRI was successful in identifying language and motor HCP areas in most cases, including novel areas such as 55b and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Functional MRI had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 71%, respectively, for motor function in HCP area 4. Sensitivity and specificity were different according to the area and fMRI protocol; i.e., semantic protocols performed better in Brodmann area (BA) 55b/peri-sylvian language areas with 100% sensitivity and 20% specificity, and word production protocols in BAs 44 and 45 with 70% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Some compensation patterns could be observed, such as motor activation of the postcentral gyrus in precentral gliomas. CONCLUSIONS HCP areas can be detected in clinical scenarios of glioma surgery. These areas appear relatively stable across patients, but compensation patterns seem to differ, allowing occasional resection of activating areas. Newly described areas such as 55b and SLF can act as critical areas in language networks. Surgical planning should account for these parcellations.

In the stimulated regions, low-frequency (<= 1 Hz) rTMS induces inhibitory effects, while high-frequency (>= 5 Hz) stimulation induces excitatory effects. However, these stereotypical effects arising from low- and high-frequency stimulation are based on measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by pulsed stimulation. To test the effects of rTMS on remote brain regions, the current study recruited 31 young healthy adults who participated in three rTMS sessions (10 Hz high frequency, 1 Hz low frequency, and sham) on three separate days. The stimulation target was based on individual fMRI activation in the motor cortex evoked by a finger movement task. Pre- and post-rTMS resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) were acquired. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC) were calculated to measure the local and global connectivity, respectively. Compared with the sham session, high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS significantly increased ReHo and DC in the right cerebellum, while low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation did not significantly alter ReHo or DC. Then, using a newly developed PAIR support vector machine (SVM) method, we achieved accuracy of 93.18-97.24% by split-half validation for pairwise comparisons between conditions for ReHo or DC. While the univariate analyses suggest that high-frequency rTMS of the left motor cortex could affect distant brain activity in the right cerebellum, the multivariate SVM results suggest that both high- and low-frequency rTMS significantly modulated widespread brain activity. The current findings are useful for increasing the understanding of the mechanisms of rTMS, as well as guiding precise individualized rTMS treatment of movement disorders.

J	Sambuco, N				Sambuco, Nicola			fMRI replicability during emotional scene viewing: Functional regions and sample size	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						amygdala; emotion; fMRI; pictures; replicability; visual cortex	HUMAN AMYGDALA; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; DISCRIMINATION; PROJECTIONS; MOTIVATION; COMMON; EXTENT	Recent findings have questioned the replicability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the study of affective processing, reporting low replicability of emotional enhancement during a face-matching task. However, poor replicability may instead reflect a lack of emotional engagement for face matching. In the current study, replicability of emotional enhancement was tested in a large (N = 160) sample when emotional engagement was assessed during pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant picture viewing, which reliably engages affective reactions in both the brain and the body. Replicability was computed using a subsampling technique, in which random sets of subjects of different sample sizes (N = 20, 40, 60, 80) were selected from the entire dataset, and replicability of emotional enhancement for peaks, clusters, and voxels were averaged across 500 permutations for each sample size. Consistent with previous findings, fMRI replicability increased with increasing sample size. On the other hand, even with relatively small samples, fMRI replicability for peaks, clusters, and voxels during emotional, compared to neutral, scene viewing was good to excellent. Importantly, replicability varied in different brain regions, with excellent replicability at both the cluster and peak level with an N of 40, at the most conservative threshold (p < .001), in the amygdala and the visual cortex. The data argue against general recommendations regarding sample size in fMRI studies of emotion, suggesting instead that degree of replicability depends on successful emotional engagement in task-related brain regions.

J	Chang, C; Liu, N; Yao, L; Zhao, XJ				Chang, Can; Liu, Ning; Yao, Li; Zhao, Xiaojie			A semi-supervised classification RBM with an improved fMRI representation algorithm	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Deep learning, Feature representation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Restricted boltzmann machine (RBM); Semi-supervised classification	SELECTION	Background and objective: Training an effective and robust supervised learning classifier is not easy due to the limitations of acquiring and labeling considerable human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Semi-supervised learning uses unlabeled data for feature learning and combines them into labeled data to build better classification models. Methods: Since no premises or assumptions are required, a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is suitable for learning data representation of neuroimages. In our study, an improved fMRI representation algorithm with a hybrid L1/L2 regularization method (HRBM) was proposed to optimize the original model for sparsity. Different from common semi-supervised classification models that treat feature learning and classification as two separate training steps, we then constructed a new semi-supervised classification RBM based on a joint training algorithm with HRBM, named Semi-HRBM. This joint training algorithm jointly trains the objective function of feature learning and classification process, so that the learned features can effectively represent the original fMRI data and adapt to the classification tasks. Results: This study uses fMRI data to identify categories of visual stimuli. In the fMRI data classification task under four visual stimuli (house, face, car, and cat), our HRBM has satisfactory feature representation capabilities and better performance for multiple classification tasks. Taking the supervised RBM (sup-RBM) as an example, our Semi-HRBM classification model improves the average accuracy of the four-classification task by 7.68%, and improves the average F1 score of each visual stimulus task by 8.90%. In addition, the generalization ability of the model was also improved. Conclusion: This research might contribute to enrich solutions for insufficiently labeled neuroimaging samples, which could help to identify complex brain states under different stimuli or tasks.

Methods Twelve subjects with bilateral end-stage glaucoma (group A), 12 with unilateral end-stage glaucoma (group B) and 12 healthy controls (group C) were enrolled. fMRI was performed under two testing stimuli conditions: passive viewing of a full-field flickering checkerboard and active viewing of a one-back task with scene images. In fMRI analysis, the primary visual cortex was divided into six regions of interest (ROIs). The beta values of the six ROIs were compared across the three groups using one-way analysis of variance under two viewing conditions. Associations between the fMRI beta value and clinical data including multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), microperimeter-1 and optical coherence tomography were analysed by Spearman correlation. Results The beta values for ROIs 1-3 representing the LPZ were significantly different between the three groups under active viewing conditions, whereas no significant changes were detected under passive viewing. In group A, there were significant differences between all six ROIs for the two viewing conditions, while no significant differences were found in groups B and C. In group A, the P-wave amplitudes of the mfERG was significantly correlated with the beta values of ROIs 1 and 2 under active viewing. In addition, the P-wave latencies of the mfERG were significantly correlated with the beta values for ROIs 2-5. No associations were found between fMRI beta values and clinical data in groups B and C. Conclusions Activation of the LPZ in the primary visual cortex was observed in patients with bilateral end-stage glaucoma under active viewing conditions. These changes were correlated with residual retinal function.

In this systematic review, we focus on the development of awake mouse blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Mice are widely used in research due to their fast-breeding cycle, genetic malleability, and low cost. Functional MRI yields whole-brain coverage and can be performed on both humans and animal models making it an ideal modality for comparing study findings across species. We provide an analysis of 30 articles (years 2011-2022) identified through a systematic literature search. Our conclusions include that head-posts are favorable, acclimation training for 10-14 d is likely ample under certain conditions, stress has been poorly characterized, and more standardization is needed to accelerate progress. For context, an overview of awake rat fMRI studies is also included. We make recommendations that will benefit a wide range of neuroscience applications.	[Mandino, Francesca; Lake, Evelyn M.

To quantitatively characterize this variability, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal can be modeled as a linear summation of a stimulation-relevant and an ongoing (i.e. stimulation-irrelevant) component. However, systematic investigation on the spatiotemporal features of the ongoing BOLD component and how these features affect the BOLD response is still lacking. Here we measured fMRI responses to light onsets and light offsets in awake rats. The neuronal response was simultaneously recorded with calcium-based fiber photometry. We established that between-region BOLD signals were highly correlated brain-wide at zero time lag, including regions that did not respond to visual stimulation, suggesting that the ongoing activity co-fluctuates across the brain. Removing this ongoing activity reduced cross-trial variability of the BOLD response by similar to 30% and increased its coherence with the Ca2+ signal. Additionally, the negative ongoing BOLD activity sometimes dominated over the stimulation-driven response and contributed to the post-stimulation BOLD undershoot. These results suggest that brain-wide ongoing activity is responsible for significant cross-trial BOLD variability, and this component can be reliably quantified and removed to improve the reliability of fMRI response. Importantly, this method can be generalized to virtually all fMRI experiments without changing stimulation paradigms.

J	Daly, I				Daly, Ian			Neural decoding of music from the EEG	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; REPRESENTATIONS; MEANINGS; EMOTION; IMAGERY; SPEECH; MODEL	Neural decoding models can be used to decode neural representations of visual, acoustic, or semantic information. Recent studies have demonstrated neural decoders that are able to decode accoustic information from a variety of neural signal types including electrocortiography (ECoG) and the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study we explore how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be combined with EEG to develop an accoustic decoder. Specifically, we first used a joint EEG-fMRI paradigm to record brain activity while participants listened to music. We then used fMRI-informed EEG source localisation and a bi-directional long-term short term deep learning network to first extract neural information from the EEG related to music listening and then to decode and reconstruct the individual pieces of music an individual was listening to. We further validated our decoding model by evaluating its performance on a separate dataset of EEG-only recordings. We were able to reconstruct music, via our fMRI-informed EEG source analysis approach, with a mean rank accuracy of 71.8% (n = 18, p < 0.05). Using only EEG data, without participant specific fMRI-informed source analysis, we were able to identify the music a participant was listening to with a mean rank accuracy of 59.2% (n = 19, p < 0.05). This demonstrates that our decoding model may use fMRI-informed source analysis to aid EEG based decoding and reconstruction of acoustic information from brain activity and makes a step towards building EEG-based neural decoders for other complex information domains such as other acoustic, visual, or semantic information.

J	Chen, DY; Di, X; Biswal, B				Chen, Donna Y.; Di, Xin; Biswal, Bharat			Cerebrovascular reactivity increases across development in multiple networks as revealed by a breath-holding task: A longitudinal fMRI study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						breath-hold; cerebrovascular reactivity; children; developmental studies; fMRI; longitudinal	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BOLD SIGNAL; TRAJECTORIES; CORTEX; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD; RESPONSES; CHILDREN	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to understand the neurodevelopmental changes that occur in cognition and behavior across childhood. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal obtained from fMRI is understood to be comprised of both neuronal and vascular information. However, it is unclear whether the vascular response is altered across age in studies investigating development in children. Since the breath-hold (BH) task is commonly used to understand cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in fMRI studies, it can be used to account for developmental differences in vascular response. This study examines how the cerebrovascular response changes over age in a longitudinal children's BH data set from the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample (aged 6-18 years old at enrollment). A general linear model approach was applied to derive CVR from BH data. To model both the longitudinal and cross-sectional effects of age on BH response, we used mixed-effects modeling with the following terms: linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and quadratic-logarithmic, to find the best-fitting model. We observed increased BH BOLD signals in multiple networks across age, in which linear and logarithmic mixed-effects models provided the best fit with the lowest Akaike information criterion scores. This shows that the cerebrovascular response increases across development in a brain network-specific manner. Therefore, fMRI studies investigating the developmental period should account for cerebrovascular changes that occur with age.

Methods: To take advantage of complementary information from multi-modal fMRI, we propose an interpretable multi-modal graph convolutional network (MGCN) model, incorporating both fMRI time series and functional connectivity (FC) between each pair of brain regions. Specifically, our model learns a graph embedding from individual brain networks derived from multi-modal data. A manifold-based regularization term is enforced to consider the relationships of subjects both within and between modalities. Furthermore, we propose the gradient-weighted regression activation mapping (Grad-RAM) and the edge mask learning to interpret the model, which is then used to identify significant cognition-related biomarkers. Results: We validate our MGCN model on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort to predict individual wide range achievement test (WRAT) score. Our model obtains superior predictive performance over GCN with a single modality and other competing approaches. The identified biomarkers are cross-validated from different approaches. Conclusion and Significance: This paper develops a new interpretable graph deep learning framework for cognition prediction, with the potential to overcome the limitations of several current data-fusion models. The results demonstrate the power of MGCN in analyzing multi-modal fMRI and discovering significant biomarkers for human brain studies.

Spatial neglect is considered to be the failure to attend or respond to stimuli on the side of the space or body opposite a cerebral lesion. In this review, we summarize and analyze fMRI studies focused specifically on spatial neglect. Evidence from fMRI studies have highlighted the role of dorsal and ventral attention networks in the pathophysiological mechanisms of spatial neglect, and also support the concept of interhemispheric rivalry as an explanatory model. fMRI studies have shown that several rehabilitation methods can induce activity changes in brain regions implicated in the control of spatial attention. Future investigations with large study cohorts and appropriate subgroup analyses should be conducted to confirm the possibility that fMRI might offer an objective standard for predicting spatial neglect and tracking the response of brain activity to clinical treatment, as well as provide biomarkers to guide rehabilitation for patients with SN.

A second-order and slice-specific linear shimming technique to improve spinal cord fMRI	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						fMRI; Spinal cord; Second-order shimming; Linear shimming; Field-mapping	B-0 FIELD; COMPENSATION; RESPIRATION; RESPONSES; PULSES; NOISE; MRI	Purpose: To develop a second-order and slice-specific linear shimming technique and investigate its efficiency in the mitigation of signal loss and distortions, and the increase of temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) within the spinal cord during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the human cervical spinal cord. Methods: All scans were performed on a General Electric Discovery MR750 3 T scanner, using a head, neck and spine coil and a neurovascular array. To improve B0 homogeneity, a field map was acquired, and second-order shims (SOS) were optimized over manually defined regions of interest (ROIs). Signal loss from dephasing by susceptibility-induced gradients was reduced by optimizing slice-specific x-, y- and z-shims to maximize signal within the spinal cord. Spectral-spatial excitation pulses were used in both the slice-specific linear shimming calibration scan and fMRI acquisitions. The shimming technique's efficiency was initially tested on eight healthy volunteers by comparing tSNR between images acquired with the manufacturer's standard linear shimming and with our SOS and xyz-shimming technique. Subsequently, using an increased spatial resolution as needed for fMRI of the spinal cord, tSNR measurements were performed on resting-state fMRI images from 14 healthy participants. Results: Spinal fMRI images acquired with only the standard linear shimming suffered from severe signal loss below the C5 vertebral level. The developed shimming technique compensated for this loss especially at levels C6 and C7, while tSNR was significantly higher at all vertebral levels with SOS and xyz-shimming than without it. Conclusion: A comprehensive shimming approach which includes the use of spectral-spatial excitation pulses along with both second-order and slice-specific linear shim optimization reduces regional signal loss and increases tSNR along the c-spine (C3-C7), improving the ability to record functional signals from the human spinal cord.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to alleviate MTBI-related headache (MTBI-HA). This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study assessed supraspinal correlates associated with the headache analgesic effect of rTMS at left prefrontal cortex (LPFC), hypothesizing real rTMS would significantly increase modulatory functions at LPFC in comparison to sham treatment. Subjects with MTBI-HA were randomized to receive either real or sham rTMS treatments and subjected to pre- and post-treatment resting state and evoked heat-pain fMRI as described in a prior study. Real rTMS consisted of 2000 pulses delivered at 10 Hz and 80% of the resting motor threshold at left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas sham treatment was delivered with same figure-of-eight coil turned 180 degrees. Follow-up fMRI was performed one-week post-treatment. All fMRI data was processed using BrainVoyager QX Software. 14 subjects receiving real and 12 subjects receiving sham treatments completed the study. The REAL group demonstrated significant (P<0.02) decreases in headache frequency and intensity at one week following treatment. fMRI scans in the REAL group showed increased evoked heat pain activity (P<0.002) and resting functional connectivity (P<0.0001) at the LPFC after rTMS. Neither this significant analgesic effect nor these fMRI findings were seen in the sham group. Sham treatment was, however, associated with a decrease in resting state activity at the LPFC (P<0.0001). This study correlates the demonstrated analgesic effect of rTMS in the treatment of MTBI-HA with enhanced supraspinal functional connectivity in the left prefrontal cortex, which is known to be involved in "top-down" pain inhibition along the descending midbrain-thalamic-cingulate pathway.

In the researches of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), clustering approaches attempt to classify voxels depending on their time-course signals into a similar hemodynamic response over time. Objective: In this work, a novel unsupervised learning approach is proposed that relies on using Enhanced Neural Gas (ENG) algorithm in fMRI data for comparison with Neural Gas (NG) method, which has yet to be utilized for that aim. The ENG algorithm depends on the network structure of the NG and concentrates on an efficacious prototype-based clustering approach. Methods: The comparison outcomes on real auditory fMRI data show that ENG outperforms the NG and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) methods due to its insensitivity to the ordering of input data sequence, various initializations for selecting a set of neurons, and the existence of extreme values (outliers). The findings also prove its capability to discover the exact and real values of a cluster number effectively. Results: Four validation indices are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed ENG method with fMRI and compare it with a clustering approach (NG algorithm) and model-based data analysis (SPM). These validation indices include the Jaccard Coefficient (JC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Minimum Description Length (MDL) value, and Minimum Square Error (MSE). Conclusion: The ENG technique can tackle all shortcomings of NG application with fMRI data, identify the active area of the human brain effectively, and determine the locations of the cluster center based on the MDL value during the process of network learning.

Methods: Rs-fMRI data were acquired from the combat sports (CS) group (n = 32, aged 14.2 +/- 1.1 years) and nonathlete healthy control (HC) group (n = 29, aged 14.8 +/- 0.9 years). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) within the cerebellum was calculated and then compared between the two groups. Results: None of these participants displayed intracranial lesions on conventional MRI and microhemorrhages on SWI, Compared with the HC group, the CS group showed decreased ALFF and ReHo in the bilateral cerebellum, mainly located in the inferior regions of the cerebellum (Cerebellum_8, Cerebellum_9, Cerebellum_7b, and Cerebellum_Crus2). While increased was found within the cerebellar network, mainly located in the superior regions near the midline (bilateral Cerebellum_6, Cerebellum_Crus1_R, and Vermis_6). There is no internetwork FC change between the CEN and other networks. Conclusion: This study confirmed extensive effects of combat sports on cerebellar rs-fMRI in adolescents, which could enhance the understanding of cerebellar regulatory mechanism under combat conditions, and provide additional information about cerebellar protective inhibition and compensatory adaptation. Advances in knowledge: Adolescent combat participants are an ideal model to study training-induced brain plasticity and vulnerability. Relative to task-related fMRI, rs-fMRI can bring more information about cerebellar regulation and explain the Central Governor Model more comprehensively.

Distinct Neurophysiological Correlates of the fMRI BOLD Signal in the Hippocampus and Neocortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrophysiology; episodic memory; fMRI; gamma; hippocampus; neocortex	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; MEMORY; ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL; FREQUENCY	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is among the foremost methods for mapping human brain function but provides only an indirect measure of underlying neural activity. Recent findings suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of the fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal might be regionally specific. We examined the neurophysiological correlates of the fMRI BOLD signal in the hippocampus and neocortex, where differences in neural architecture might result in a different relationship between the respective signals. Fifteen human neurosurgical patients (10 female, 5 male) implanted with depth electrodes performed a verbal free recall task while electrophysiological activity was recorded simultaneously from hippocampal and neocortical sites. The same patients subsequently performed a similar version of the task during a later fMRI session. Subsequent memory effects (SMEs) were computed for both imaging modalities as patterns of encoding-related brain activity predictive of later free recall. Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed that the relationship between BOLD and gamma-band SMEs was moderated by the lobar location of the recording site. BOLD and high gamma (70-150 Hz) SMEs positively covaried across much of the neocortex. This relationship was reversed in the hippocampus, where a negative correlation between BOLD and high gamma SMEs was evident. We also observed a negative relationship between BOLD and low gamma (30-70 Hz) SMEs in the medial temporal lobe more broadly. These results suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of the BOLD signal in the hippocampus differ from those observed in the neocortex.

While scalp recordings have contributed to understanding the psychological processes underlying the N400, they have been limited in identifying its neural basis. However, recent intracranial ERP recordings and fMRI studies have shed light on the crucial role of the anterior medial temporal lobe (AMTL) in semantic information processing. These findings suggest that the N400 partially represents activity in the AMTL structures. To investigate the neural underpinnings of the N400 effect, we simultaneously recorded ERPs and event-related fMRI during a semantic priming paradigm in a sample of 12 young, healthy subjects. Additionally, we collected ERPs and structural brain data from older healthy adults and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a population characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the AMTL. In our fMRI results, we identified bilateral loci in the AMTL as the global maxima. Employing an EEG-informed fMRI analysis, we explored trial-to-trial fluctuations in semantic processing by linking single-trial N400 amplitudes to the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. This approach provided the first direct evidence linking the N400 recorded at the scalp level to the corresponding BOLD signal in the AMTL. Consistent with these findings, patients with aMCI exhibited a diminished N400 effect compared to healthy older adults. Furthermore, voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed a correlation between the magnitude of the N400 effect and the integrity of the AMTL. By integrating data from simultaneous EEG-fMRI, and patient studies, our research advances our understanding of the neural substrate of the N400 and highlights the critical involvement of the AMTL in semantic processing.

However, rTMS is unlikely to elicit motor evoked potentials in the affected hemisphere, nor would activity be detected when stroke patients with severe hemiplegia perform an fMRI motor task using the affected limbs. The current study proposed that the peak voxel in the resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) motor network determined by independent component analysis (ICA) could be a potential stimulation target. Twenty-one healthy young subjects underwent RS-fMRI at three visits (V1 and V2 on a GE MR750 scanner and V3 on a Siemens Prisma) under eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions. Single-subject ICA with different total number of components (20, 30, and 40) were evaluated, and then the locations of peak voxels on the left and right sides of the sensorimotor network (SMN) were identified. While most ICA RS-fMRI studies have been carried out on the group level, that is, Group-ICA, the current study performed individual ICA because only the individual analysis could guide the individual target of rTMS. The intra- (test-retest) and inter-scanner reliabilities of the peak location were calculated. The use of 40 components resulted in the highest test-retest reliability of the peak location in both the left and right SMN compared with that determined when 20 and 30 components were used for both EC and EO conditions. ICA with 40 components might be another way to define a potential target in the SMN for poststroke rTMS treatment.

However, the most common SE BOLD acquisition method, SE-EPI, is known to suffer from T-2' contrast contamination with undesirable draining vein bias. To address this, in this study, we extended a recently developed distortion/blurring-free multi-shot EPI technique, Echo-Planar Time-resolved Imaging (EPTI), to cortical-depth dependent SE-fMRI at 7T to test whether it could provide purer SE BOLD contrast with minimal T-2' contamination for improved neuronal specificity. From the same acquisition, the time-resolved feature of EPTI also provides a series of asymmetric SE (ASE) images with varying T-2' weightings, and enables extraction of data equivalent to conventional SE EPI with different echo train lengths (ETLs). This allows us to systematically examine how T-2'-contribution affects different SE acquisition strategies using a single dataset. A low-rank spatiotemporal subspace reconstruction was implemented for the SE-EPTI acquisition, which incorporates corrections for both shot-to-shot phase variations and dynamic B-0 drifts. SE-EPTI was used in a visual task fMRI experiment to demonstrate that i) the pure SE image provided by EPTI results in the highest microvascular specificity; ii) the ASE EPTI series, with a graded introduction of T-2' weightings at time points farther away from the pure SE, show a gradual sensitivity increase along with increasing draining vein bias; iii) the longer ETL seen in conventional SE EPI acquisitions will induce more draining vein bias. Consistent results were observed across multiple subjects, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed technique for SE-BOLD fMRI with high specificity.

The dynamically changing field can be measured from the phase of the fMRI data and corrected. However, methods for doing so need multi-echo data, time-consuming reference scans and/or involve error-prone processing steps, such as phase unwrapping, which are difficult to implement robustly on the MRI host. The improved dynamic distortion correction method we propose is based on the phase of the single-echo EPI data acquired for fMRI, phase offsets calculated from a triple-echo, bipolar reference scan of circa 3-10 s duration using a method which avoids the need for phase unwrapping and an additional correction derived from one EPI volume in which the readout direction is reversed. This Reverse-Encoded First Image and Low resoLution reference scan (REFILL) approach is shown to accurately measure B-0 as it changes due to shim, motion and respiration, even with large dynamic changes to the field at 7 T, where it led to a > 20% increase in time-series signal to noise ratio compared to data corrected with the classic static approach. fMRI results from REFILL-corrected data were free of stimulus-correlated distortion artefacts seen when data were corrected with static field mapping. The method is insensitive to shim changes and eddy current differences between the reference scan and the fMRI time series, and employs calculation steps that are simple and robust, allowing most data processing to be performed in real time on the scanner image reconstruction computer. These improvements make it feasible to routinely perform dynamic distortion correction in fMRI.

J	Piani, MC; Maggioni, E; Delvecchio, G; Brambilla, P				Piani, Maria Chiara; Maggioni, Eleonora; Delvecchio, Giuseppe; Brambilla, Paolo			Sustained attention alterations in major depressive disorder: A review of fMRI studies employing Go/No-Go and CPT tasks	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Review						Major depressive disorder; fMRI; Review; Go/No-Go; CPT; Attention networks; Cognitive networks	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SCALE BRAIN NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTION REGULATION; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; METAANALYSIS	Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric condition characterized by selective cognitive dysfunctions. In this regard, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies showed, both at resting state and during tasks, alterations in the brain functional networks involved in cognitive processes in MDD patients compared to controls. Among those, it seems that the attention network may have a role in the disease pathophysiology. Therefore, in this review we aim at summarizing the current fMRI evidence investigating sustained attention in MDD patients. Methods: We conducted a search on PubMed on case-control studies on MDD employing fMRI acquisitions during Go/No-Go and continuous performance tasks. A total of 12 studies have been included in the review. Results: Overall, the majority of fMRI studies reported quantitative alterations in the response to attentive tasks in selective brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the temporal and parietal lobes, the insula and the precuneus, which are key nodes of the attention, the executive, and the default mode networks. Limitations: The heterogeneity in the study designs, fMRI acquisition techniques and processing methods have limited the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: The results from the included studies showed the presence of alterations in the activation patterns of regions involved in sustained attention in MDD, which are in line with current evidence and seemed to explain some of the key symptoms of depression. However, given the paucity and heterogeneity of studies available, it may be worthwhile to continue investigating the attentional domain in MDD with ad-hoc study designs to retrieve more robust evidence.

Clinical practice of language fMRI in epilepsy centers: a European survey and conclusions by the ESNR Epilepsy Working Group	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; Language; Epilepsy; Survey; Europe	PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; LATERALIZATION; PARADIGM; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; REPETITION; SURGERY; BRAIN; TASKS	Purpose To assess current clinical practices throughout Europe with respect to acquisition, implementation, evaluation, and interpretation of language functional MRI (fMRI) in epilepsy patients. Methods An online survey was emailed to all European Society of Neuroradiology members (n = 1662), known associates (n = 6400), and 64 members of European Epilepsy network. The questionnaire featured 40 individual items on demographic data, clinical practice and indications, fMRI paradigms, radiological workflow, data post-processing protocol, and reporting. Results A total of 49 non-duplicate entries from European centers were received from 20 countries. Of these, 73.5% were board-certified neuroradiologists and 69.4% had an in-house epilepsy surgery program. Seventy-one percent of centers performed fewer than five scans per month for epilepsy. The most frequently used paradigms were phonemic verbal fluency (47.7%) and auditory comprehension (55.6%), but variants of 13 paradigms were described. Most centers assessed the fMRI task performance (75.5%), ensured cognitive-task adjustment (77.6%), trained the patient before scanning (85.7%), and assessed handedness (77.6%), but only 28.6% had special paradigms for patients with cognitive impairments. fMRI was post-processed mainly by neuroradiologists (42.1%), using open-source software (55.0%). Reporting was done primarily by neuroradiologists (74.2%). Interpretation was done mainly by visual inspection (65.3%). Most specialists (81.6%) were able to determine the hemisphere dominance for language in more than 75% of exams, attributing failure to the patient not performing the task correctly. Conclusion This survey shows that language fMRI is firmly embedded in the preoperative management of epilepsy patients. The wide variety of paradigms and the use of non-CE-marked software underline the need for establishing reference standards.

A great deal of attention has been attracted to introduce machine learning methods to study the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in order to find out its neurophysiological underpinnings. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive review about the previous studies since 2011, which applied machine learning methods to analyze the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of autistic individuals and the typical controls (TCs). The all-round process was covered, including feature construction from raw fMRI data, feature selection methods, machine learning methods, factors for high classification accuracy, and critical conclusions. Applying different machine learning methods and fMRI data acquired from different sites, classification accuracies were obtained ranging from 48.3% up to 97%, and informative brain regions and networks were located. Through thorough analysis, high classification accuracies were found to usually occur in the studies which involved task-based fMRI data, single dataset for some selection principle, effective feature selection methods, or advanced machine learning methods. Advanced deep learning together with the multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset became research trends especially in the recent 4 years. In the future, advanced feature selection and machine learning methods combined with multi-site dataset or easily operated task-based fMRI data may appear to have the potentiality to serve as a promising diagnostic tool for ASD.

In this paper, we investigated the stationarity and linearity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data from the Midnight Scan Club datasets. The degree of stationarity (DS) and the degree of non-linearity (DN) were, respectively, estimated for the time series of all gray matter voxels. The similarity and difference between the DS and DN were assessed in terms of voxels and intrinsic brain networks, including the visual network, somatomotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network, limbic network, frontoparietal network, and default-mode network. The test-retest scans were utilized to quantify the reliability of DS and DN. We found that DS and DN maps had overlapping spatial distribution. Meanwhile, the probability density estimate function of DS had a long tail, and that of DN had a more normal distribution. Specifically, stronger DS was present in the somatomotor, limbic, and ventral attention networks compared to other networks, and stronger DN was found in the somatomotor, visual, limbic, ventral attention, and default-mode networks. The percentage of overlapping voxels between DS and DN in different networks demonstrated a decreasing trend in the order default mode, ventral attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual, and limbic. Furthermore, the ICC values of DS were higher than those of DN. Our results suggest that different functional networks have distinct properties of non-stationarity and non-linearity owing to the complexity of rs-fMRI time series. Thus, caution should be taken when analyzing fMRI data (both resting-state and task-activation) using simplified models.

Modality of practice modulates resting state connectivity during motor learning	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						fMRI; Motor learning; Motor imagery; Functional connectivity; rs-fMRI	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SINGLE-SUBJECT; IMAGERY; PERFORMANCE; ACCURACY; TIME; ICA; CONSISTENCY; NETWORK	When bookending skilled motor practice, changes in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI; used to characterise synchronized patterns of activity when the brain is at rest) reflect functional reorganization that supports motor memory consolidation and learning. Despite its use in practice in numerous domains, the neural mechanisms underlying motor memory consolidation and learning that result from motor imagery practice (MIP) relative to physical practice are not well understood. The current study examined how rsfMRI is modulated by skilled motor practice that results through either MIP or physical practice. Two groups of participants engaged in five days of MIP or physical practice of a dart throwing task. Performance and rs-fMRI were captured before and after training. Relative to physical practice, where focal changes in rs-fMRI within a cerebellar-cortical network were observed, MIP stimulated widespread changes in rs-fMRI within a frontoparietal network encompassing bilateral regions. Findings indicate functional reorganization that supports motor memory consolidation and learning is not equivalent across practice modalities. Ultimately, this work provides new information regarding the unique neural underpinnings MIP relies on to drive motor memory consolidation and learning.

To obtain high specificity and sensitivity, we propose to utilize a vessel-size-sensitive filter to the GE-BOLD signal, which suppresses macrovascular contributions and to combine selectively retained microvascular GE-BOLD signals with the SE-BOLD signals. To investigate our proposed idea, fMRI with 0.8 mm isotropic resolution was performed on the primary motor and sensory cortices in humans at 7 T by implementing spin-and gradient-echo (SAGE) echo planar imaging (EPI) acquisition. Microvascular-passed sigmoidal filters were designed based upon the vessel-size-sensitive delta R-2*/delta R-2 value for retaining GE-BOLD signals originating from venous vessels with <= 45 mu m and <= 65 mu m diameter. Unlike GE-BOLD fMRI, the laminar profile of SAGE-BOLD fMRI with the vessel-size-sensitive filter peaked at similar to 1.0 mm from the surface of the primary motor and sensory cortices, demonstrating an improvement of laminar specificity over GE-BOLD fMRI. Also, the functional sensitivity of SAGE BOLD at middle layers (0.75-1.5 mm) was improved by similar to 80% to similar to 100% when compared with SE BOLD. In summary, we showed that combined GE-and SE-BOLD fMRI with the vessel-size-sensitive filter indeed yielded improved laminar specificity and sensitivity and is there-fore an excellent tool for high spatial resolution ultra-high filed (UHF)-fMRI studies for resolving mesoscopic functional units.

Ten subjects were selected as normal subjects, and 41 degrees C and 51 degrees C were performed on the dorsal side of the right forearm of all subjects, respectively. CCHS mission-mode functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) scans (41 degrees C. CCHS-fMRI group and 51 degrees C CHS-fMRI group) were pre-processed with fMRI using SPM8. A single sample t-test was used to compare 41 degrees C CCHS-fMRI group and 51 degrees C. The CCHS-fMRI group underwent intragroup analysis to observe the activation of brain regions under two different temperature CHS, and recorded the activation intensity of the activation region. A paired t-test was used to explore the difference in activation between the PD group and the control group, and brain regions with statistically significant differences were analyzed. The activation intensity of the activated brain region was recorded, and the cause of the difference was analyzed. At the end of the trial, the visual analog scale (CVAS) was used to score the pain experienced by the subject at the stimulation temperature, and then the subject was subjected to a sensory quantification test (QST), including the measurement of thermal sensation (WS) and thermal pain (HP). At the same time, under the same intensity electrical stimulation, the activation signal of the lateral thalamus was stronger than that of the lateral thalamus, showing a contralateral advantage, while the bilateral thalamus lacked this manifestation. The thalamus should be an important component of the pain-regulating network. This region exhibits a segregation-activated phenomenon, and each region has its own unique stimulatory response characteristics, which helps to understand the role of the thalamus in the treatment of pain information.

The present study aims to investigate the hemodynamic and electrophysical changes induced by BCI training using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) respectively, as well as the relationship between the neurological changes and motor function improvement. Fourteen chronic stroke subjects received 20 sessions of BCI-guided robot hand training. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI data were acquired before and immediately after the intervention. Seed-based functional connectivity for resting-state fMRI data and effective connectivity analysis for EEG were processed to reveal the neuroplasticity changes and interaction between different brain regions. Moreover, the relationship among motor function improvement, hemodynamic changes, and electrophysical changes derived from the two neuroimaging modalities was also investigated. This work suggested that (a) significant motor function improvement could be obtained after BCI training therapy, (b) training effect significantly correlated with functional connectivity change between ipsilesional M1 (iM1) and contralesional Brodmann area 6 (including premotor area (cPMA) and supplementary motor area (SMA)) derived from fMRI, (c) training effect significantly correlated with information flow change from cPMA to iM1 and strongly correlated with information flow change from SMA to iM1 derived from EEG, and (d) consistency of fMRI and EEG results illustrated by the correlation between functional connectivity change and information flow change. Our study showed changes in the brain after the BCI training therapy from chronic stroke survivors and provided a better understanding of neural mechanisms, especially the interaction among motor-related brain regions during stroke recovery. Besides, our finding demonstrated the feasibility and consistency of combining multiple neuroimaging modalities to investigate the neuroplasticity change.

J	Feitosa, JA; Fernandes, CA; Casseb, RF; Castellano, G				Feitosa, Jamille A.; Fernandes, Corina A.; Casseb, Raphael F.; Castellano, Gabriela			Effects of virtual reality-based motor rehabilitation: a systematic review of fMRI studies	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						virtual reality; fMRI; motor rehabilitation; stroke; plasticity	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; CHRONIC STROKE; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; NEURAL REORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; STANDING BALANCE; BRAIN; THERAPY; ADOLESCENTS; ACTIVATION	Background. The use of virtual reality (VR) as a rehabilitation tool has been shown to induce motor and cognitive improvements in different populations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to investigate neuroplasticity resulting from these treatments. We hypothesize that VR rehabilitation induces functional improvement and brain changes that can be detected by fMRI. Objective. To systematically review the effects of VR intervention on the cortical reorganization measured by fMRI and associated with functional improvement. Approach. We performed a systematic review of studies published between 2005 and 2021. Papers were retrieved from six databases using the following keywords: 'motor rehabilitation', 'fMRI' and 'virtual reality'. Case studies, pre-post studies, cross-sectional studies, and randomized controlled trials published were included. Manuscripts were assessed by The National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools to determine their quality. Main results. Twenty-three articles met our eligibility criteria: 18 about VR rehabilitation in stroke and five on other clinical conditions (older adults, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson's disease). Changes in neural patterns of activation and reorganization were revealed in both the ipsilesional and the contralesional hemispheres. Results were located mainly in the primary motor cortex, sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area in post-stroke patients in the acute, subacute, and chronic rehabilitation phases, and were associated with functional improvement after VR intervention. Similar effects were observed in older adults and in patients with other neurological diseases with improved performance. Significance. Most stroke-related studies showed either restoration to normal or increase of activation patterns or relateralization at/to the ipsilesional hemisphere, with some also reporting a decrease in activity or extent of activation after VR therapy. In general, VR intervention demonstrated evidence of efficacy both in neurological rehabilitation and in performance improvement of older adults, accompanied by fMRI evidence of brain reorganization.

Convergent neural representations of experimentally-induced acute pain in healthy volunteers: A large-scale fMRI meta-analysis	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Pain; Neuroimaging; Meta-analysis; fMRI	SECONDARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; COORDINATE-BASED METAANALYSIS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; ACTIVATION; STIMULI; SUBREGIONS; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	Characterizing a reliable, pain-related neural signature is critical for translational applications. Many prior fMRI studies have examined acute nociceptive pain-related brain activation in healthy participants. However, synthesizing these data to identify convergent patterns of activation can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of experimental designs and samples. To address this challenge, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of fMRI studies of stimulus-induced pain in healthy participants. Following pre-registration, two independent reviewers evaluated 4,927 abstracts returned from a search of 8 databases, with 222 fMRI experiments meeting inclusion criteria. We analyzed these experiments using Activation Likelihood Estimation with rigorous type I error control(voxel height p < 0.001, cluster p < 0.05 FWE-corrected) and found a convergent, largely bilateral pattern of pain-related activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, midcingulate cortex, and thalamus. Notably, these regions were consistently recruited regardless of stimulation technique, location of induction, and participant sex. These findings suggest a highly-conserved core set of pain-related brain areas, encouraging applications as a biomarker for novel therapeutics targeting acute nociceptive pain.

Data and model considerations for estimating time-varying functional connectivity in fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Time-varying FC; Hidden Markov Model (HMM); Resting state	RESTING-STATE FMRI; COMMUNICATION; DYNAMICS	Functional connectivity (FC) in the brain has been shown to exhibit subtle but reliable modulations within a session. One way of estimating time-varying FC is by using state-based models that describe fMRI time series as temporal sequences of states, each with an associated, characteristic pattern of FC. However, the estimation of these models from data sometimes fails to capture changes in a meaningful way, such that the model estimation assigns entire sessions (or the largest part of them) to a single state, therefore failing to capture within-session state modulations effectively; we refer to this phenomenon as the model becoming static, or model stasis. Here, we aim to quantify how the nature of the data and the choice of model parameters affect the model's ability to detect temporal changes in FC using both simulated fMRI time courses and resting state fMRI data. We show that large between-subject FC differences can overwhelm subtler within-session modulations, causing the model to become static. Further, the choice of parcellation can also affect the model's ability to detect temporal changes. We finally show that the model often becomes static when the number of free parameters per state that need to be estimated is high and the number of observations available for this estimation is low in comparison. Based on these findings, we derive a set of practical recommendations for time-varying FC studies, in terms of preprocessing, parcellation and complexity of the model.	[Ahrends, C.; Kringelbach, M.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel adversarial self -supervised graph neural network (GNN) based on graph contrastive learning, named A-GCL, for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Taking advantage of the success of GNNs in psychiatric disease diagnosis using fMRI, our proposed A-GCL model is expected to improve the performance of diagnosis and provide more robust results. A-GCL takes graphs constructed from the fMRI images as input and uses contrastive learning to extract features for classification. The graphs are constructed with 3 bands of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as node features and Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCC) of the average fMRI time series in different brain regions as edge weights. The contrastive learning creates an edge-dropped graph from a trainable Bernoulli mask to extract features that are invariant to small variations of the graph. Experiment results on three datasets - Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) I, ABIDE II, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - with 3 atlases - AAL1, AAL3, Shen268 - demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of A-GCL compared to the other GNN-based models. Extensive ablation studies verify the robustness of the proposed approach to atlas selection and model variation. Explanatory results reveal key functional connections and brain regions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

The potential of neurofeedback to alter the M1-cerebellum connectivity was explored using motor imagery-based rt-fMRI. These regions were chosen due to their importance in motor performance and motor rehabilitation. Methods. Four right-handed individuals were recruited to examine the potential to change the M1-cerebellum neurofeedback link. The University of Glasgow Cognitive Neuroimaging Centre used a 3T MRI scanner from January 2019 to January 2020 to conduct this prospective study. Everyone participated in each fMRI session, which included six NF training runs. Participants were instructed to imagine complicated hand motions during the NF training to raise a thermometer bar's height. To contrast the correlation coefficients between the initial and last NF runs, a t-test was performed post hoc. Results. The neurofeedback connection between M1 and the cerebellum was strengthened in each participant. Motor imagery strategy was a significant task in training M1-cerebellum connectivity as participants used it successfully to enhance the activation level between these regions during M1-cerebellum modulation using real-time fMRI. The t-test and linear regression, on the other hand, showed this increase to be insignificant. Conclusion. A novel technique to manipulate M1-cerebellum connectivity was discovered using real-time fMRI NF. This study showed that each participant's neurofeedback connectivity between M1 and cerebellum was enhanced. This increase, on the other hand, was insignificant statistically. The results showed that the connectivity between both areas increased positively. Through the integration of fMRI and neurofeedback, M1-cerebellum connectivity can be positively affected.

Functional imaging studies of acute administration of classic psychedelics, ketamine, and MDMA: Methodological limitations and convergent results	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						States; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; FMRI; Psychedelics; Ketamine; Psilocybin; LSD; MDMA	HEAD MOTION; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; NETWORK; DEPRESSION; PSILOCYBIN; GLUTAMATE; STATE; LSD; NEURODEVELOPMENT	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly used to non-invasively study the acute impact of psychedelics on the human brain. While fMRI is a promising tool for measuring brain function in response to psychedelics, it also has known methodological challenges. We conducted a systematic review of fMRI studies examining acute responses to experimentally administered psychedelics in order to identify convergent findings and characterize heterogeneity in the literature. We reviewed 91 full-text papers; these studies were notable for substantial heterogeneity in design, task, dosage, drug timing, and statistical approach. Data recycling was common, with 51 unique samples across 91 studies. Fifty-seven studies (54%) did not meet contemporary standards for Type I error correction or control of motion artifact. Psilocybin and LSD were consistently reported to moderate the connectivity architecture of the sensorimotor-association cortical axis. Studies also consistently reported that ketamine administration increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Moving forward, use of best practices such as pre-registration, standardized image processing and statistical testing, and data sharing will be important in this rapidly developing field.

This is despite the plethora of research highlighting BOLD modulations due to vascular changes induced by disease, drugs, and aging. On the other hand, BOLD fMRI-based assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is often used as an indicator of the brain's vascular health and has been shown to be strongly associated with cognitive function. This review paper considers the relationship between BOLD-based assessments of CVR, cognition and task-based fMRI. How the BOLD response reflects both CVR and neural activity, and how findings of altered CVR in disease and in normal physiology are associated with cognition and BOLD signal changes are discussed. These are pertinent considerations for fMRI applications aiming to understand the biological basis of cognition. Therefore, a discussion of how the acquisition of BOLD-based CVR can enhance our ability to map human brain function, with limitations and potential future directions, is presented.

J	Wu, HF; Li, D; Lu, MZ; Zeng, Y				Wu, Haifeng; Li, Dong; Lu, Mingzhi; Zeng, Yu			fMRI activations via low-complexity second-order inverse-sparse-transform blind separation	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fMRI; BSS; SOBI; Inverse-sparse transform	MODEL; ALGORITHMS	Since functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals are a group of sparse signals, and its autocorrelation matrix contains limited information, it is difficult to accurately locate the brain activation area directly using traditional blind separation algorithms. For the issue, this paper proposes a method with inverse-sparse transform and second order blind identification (SOBI) for the separation of the activations. The contribution of this paper is to achieve the separation of sparse brain map signals and have lower computational complexity than higher-order statistical BSS. In experiments, we use both simulated and measured fMRI data to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that the proposed method's running time is only 1/30 of a higher-order statistical independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, while its separation errors is close to ICA and less than half of a traditional SOBI algorithm.

Examining fMRI time-series entropy as a marker for brain E/I balance with pharmacological neuromodulation in a non-human primate translational model	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Sample entropy; Restricted sample entropy; Complexity; E/I balance; Disinhibition; Sub-anesthetic ketamine; Pharmacological fMRI; Nonhuman primate models	KETAMINE	Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the neuroimaging community in exploring fMRI time-series measures of local neuronal activity and excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the brain. In this preliminary study we probed the sensitivity of widely used sample entropy (SE) measure at multiple scales to controlled alteration of the brain's E/I balance in non-human primates (NHPs) with a well-characterized sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion fMRI model. We found that SE failed to detect the expected changes in E/I balance induced by ketamine. Subsequently, noticing that the complexity in the time series contributing SE could be dominated by non-neuronal noise in this experimental setting, we developed a new time-series measure called restricted sample entropy (RSE) by restricting SE estimations to regular portions of the fMRI time-series. RSE was able to adequately reflect the increased excitatory activity engendered by disinhibition of glutamergic neurons, through sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion. These results show that RSE is potentially a powerful tool for examining local neural activity, E/I balance, and alterations in brain state.

Conceptualizing psychological resilience through resting-state functional MRI in a mentally healthy population: a systematic review	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						psychological resilience; resting-state; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); healthy population; operational definitions of resilience; neural mechanisms	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION; BRAINS DEFAULT NETWORK; EMOTION REGULATION; TRAIT RESILIENCE; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY; LIFE SATISFACTION; STRESS; DISORDER; SCALE	Conceptualizations and operational definitions of psychological resilience vary across resilience neuroimaging studies. Data on the neural features of resilience among healthy individuals has been scarce. Furthermore, findings from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were inconsistent across studies. This systematic review summarized resting-state fMRI findings in different modalities from various operationally defined resilience in a mentally healthy population. The PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched. Articles that focused on resting-state fMRI in relation to resilience, and published before 2022, were targeted. Orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula and amygdala, were reported the most from the 19 included studies. Regions in emotional network was reported the most from the included studies. The involvement of regions like amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex indicated the relationships between emotional processing and resilience. No common brain regions or neural pathways were identified across studies. The emotional network appears to be studied the most in association with resilience. Matching fMRI modalities and operational definitions of resilience across studies are essential for meta-analysis.	[Tai, Alan P.
